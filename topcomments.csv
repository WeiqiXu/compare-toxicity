Let's just arm everyone and settle this Battle Royale.
"This is already a thing, and has been for years.
https://kxan.com/2018/02/16/north-texas-schools-with-armed-teachers-hope-to-protect-students/

It is voluntary, the names of the teachers who are carrying in these ISDs are not released to prevent painting a target on them, and they undergo training over and above what is required for a License To Carry. "
"Of course, the best way to stop school shootings from occurring is to put the guns in the school. It's obvious"
Why stop there? How about guns for students... oh right.
"The worst idea in my opinion. One day,  a pissed off armed teacher will open fire on students.  Mark my words. "
"I am a teacher and I do not want a gun.  I would probably end up planting a gun on Kevin and say he attacked the school.  

Kevin."
What if teachers don't want to carry guns or want that responsibility? Are we going to pay them more finally now that they are also supposed to be security guards as well as teach our children?
"No money for crayons but the state's gonna pay for every teacher to have a Ruger.  Yeah, suuuure.  Not to mention most teachers don't want to carry and use guns.  Anyone who says this is a solution is a liar or a moron."
"Nobody except the NRA and their subjects actually want this, because gun sales are their goal. The logistics alone are a nightmare, teachers don't even have basic school supplies in many cases"
Ideas like this allway remember me of: https://youtu.be/0rR9IaXH1M0
what a fucking retard 
Who do we give guns to in case the teacher goes crazy?
"As someone getting ready to teach myself after having a lot of experience working in schools through my university, I think this is fucking stupid.  The teachers aren’t trained.  The kids won’t feel anymore safe.  The kids will try to get to the gun if possible.  A better, and possibly cheaper idea would be to hire a police officer for each public school.  "
It's like he's read every right wing meme on facebook and decided it would good policy. You can't make this shit up.  
Didn't we learn from con air! 
"So now our underpaid teachers need to be trained on how to take down a fucking armed assailant?  I'm not talking about how to shoot a gun or how to handle a gun safely - any one can sit through those training courses and aim at a target at a range.   Can they handle that gun under the pressure of the situation? What if the assailant grabs a kid for a hostage or a meat shield?  What if there are two gunmen? 

Who is liable? If the teacher is armed but doesn't fire back and a kid dies - can they be held responsible for not protecting the child properly? If a teacher chose not to be armed are they held responsible? Can a teacher chose not to be armed? What if they mistake an innocent student for the gunmen and fire?

No one is thinking this through.  As a functioning society we do our best to collectively pass laws to keep us safe. We know that the world is perfect so we fill in the gaps with the police. Our educators should not be the police."
"So when a teacher gets fired, they'll have to turn in their gun."
He really has no fucking clue.
"The government does not fund schools adequately but they have the funds to arm teachers? The government will supply firearms and training for every teacher in every school in every state in the United States. Kindergarten through twelfth grade. Please tell me this is some sick joke. It feels surreal that this is a serious suggestion. The government does not have money for paper and pencils, books and smaller classroom sizes but the president of the United States endorses arming teachers. "
"That's brilliant, let's secure every building that way! Everyone in airports and courthouses should be given guns instead of just walking through metal detectors."
Throwing guns at a gun problem is like putting out a housr fire with a flamethrower
"He... He can't be this stupid, can he?"
"So to combat schoolshootings we should arm overworked, underpaid teachers that should when the worst come to worst, be forced to shoot one of their own students? Should we start issueing combat pay/hazardous duty pay for the teachers? Because if you are asking teachers to risk their life for the pay they get, they should at least get proper compensation. Instead of the the going rate of ""Thoughts and Prayers"" for each school shooting."
"So here's your name badge, door pass swipe card and oh, your Glock. Note that you're restricted to 3 bullets for the first month, after that you'll get the full clip. Have a good first day - I'm sure your students are going to just love you! "
This will 100% end up with a kid getting shot because they stole the teachers gun for a prank or something along those lines.
"Timetable:

8:30-8:35 morning home room

8:40-10:05 p.e. @ no man's land

10:05-10:50 sci @ bunker 402

10:55-11-35 math @ shooting range #2

..."
What if the teacher is the shooter? We should arm the students to protect from armed teachers.
OH for fuck sakes.
"Why dont we give them kinder egg surprises ?
Dan Roberts claims they claim more victims then guns and where banned for this reason.
If kinder egg surprises are more dangerous then guns we should give them to police and military to fight crime !
"
"No one is suggesting the schools but guns for the teachers, as some comments in here are implying. The proposal is that teachers with CC permits simply be allowed to carry at work like many other places. No one is suggesting the school have an armory; teachers would be responsible for their training and it's up to them if they carry or not. "
"Ah yes, arm the low paid, highly stressed teacher that has no training and had to spend her wages on basic classroom supplies. I'm sure Mrs Robinson is going to love shooting at kids."
"It’s not feasible in the short term to take guns from the hands of crazies. We need to arm the schools. Doing it like this wouldn’t be my first choice, but we need to do it. "
How about having police officers make rounds at schools? That would make much more sense then giving a gun to Mr. Smith who hates little Johnny. Little Johnny knows a. Mr. Smith hates him and b. He has a gun so therefore little Johnny has nightmares Mr. Smith will shoot his ass! Good thinking President 
"Being ready to be shot to death shouldn't be the new normal for underpaid, overworked, yet loving teachers. What a fucking disgusting burden we put on them in this culture. I'm angry at the media that have called these teachers, who have died protecting children during school shootings, ""angels."" They're people who have families and we just expect them to add being sacrificed to your recreational gun rights to their job description. Fuck that and anyone who thinks this is a good idea."
"I want nothing short of chaingun arms for our teachers.

That or maybe a few ED-209's"
"Wait until one of the armed teachers go rogue and then we'll have to arm the fucking kids themselves.

Then we can begin a whole new arms race. 

They can create whole new lines of bullet-proof student uniforms."
Hahahahaha!
Why not hire veterans that need jobs and actually know how to use a gun. Give guns to teachers?? Ok. The kid walks in the class and shoots the teacher first. Now what. Another teacher comes in and has to shoot a kid. Quits their job because thats pretty fucking dramatic. 
"Oh yeah that will play out just fine I'm sure.

Can't you guys just get rid of him already?"
Let's ask people who work in education if arming the faculty is going to reduce school shootings... and take a statistical count of how many teachers can answer this question without ironic laughter...
I'm starting to think Reddit is writing prophecies now.
"As a teacher, this isn’t what I signed up for"
Uninformed like every position Trump takes. 
Is he gonna go Oprah on America? You get a gun! You get a gun! How is he gonna give gun to teachers if they dont even get books or material to work with. Are the bullets gonna be included? Or the teachers are gonna have to buy them?? I'm confuse...
"That's a very trumpy idea.

All it would do is reduce a stressed/disturbed students ability to get out of the situation and cooldown, I'm positive many more shootings would occur if a bullied, stressed/strained, upset individual could just grab a teachers gun in the heat of the moment & from there anything can happen, none of its good.


Even if its not a random heat of the moment situation, it makes it even easier for a premeditating 'massacre' student to do there thing - all he/she needs to know is where a teacher keeps there gun and all they would need to do is grab that and do his thing... eliminating the need & risks involved with getting money / buying a gun / smuggling it into the school.


It's a safe bet Teachers guns won't be secured in a cabinet, or monitored 24/7 probably find them in drawers of desks, staff rooms or left behind in a jacket, then theres the risk of a teacher just absolutely losing it with a student."
"Great, not even Syria has armed teachers  and they are going through a brutal civil war. "
US-internal
Well a shooting was stopped by an armed principal (vice principal?) So.. https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/school-shootings-teachers.amp.html
"I'd rather they assign a police officer to each school. I fear the contamination that each teacher carrying a arms could lead to. If the students are able to get their hands on the weapons due to incompetent lock-down by teachers it will cause all the more harm and lets be honest, not every teacher is by nature a match for someone who should carry arms."
"At least Trump is consistent: he always finds the dumbest solution for every problem. I'm surprised that he's not advocating building beautiful, 30 foot tall walls around every school."
Why should teachers have to be responsible for making the call to shoot one of their students?
"He’s a buisinessman, not an ethics leader. Choose your donations wisely."
"New teacher here.  Arming us won't prevent a shooting, it would only give us a means to end one.  You don't know somebody is a bad guy until they start doing bad things, which means a gun will most likely be fired at least once in a school before an armed teacher will have the evidence needed to justify using their gun.  There may not be as many casualties, but people will still get hurt.  Do I have a solution? No.  I just wish I didn't have to think about whether I would be willing to risk a weapon getting into the hands of a student."
What of the teachers get stressed out and takes it out on the students?  Clearly the answer is to armed the students in case the teachers go crazy!! /s
"We do have a million alternatives but none of them are viable to stop a shooter. If they were police forces would not carry pistols. My local police force carries mace and a taser, yet they still end up shooting a guy that they outnumber 10 to 1. Gun legislation is another topic, but there is no non lethal way to deal with an active shooter."
I hope they're providing them with Tricare and BAH while they're at it. 
"Finally, this has been tried (Israel) and assuming we make the same rigorous mental testing and training standards in sure this would help with school shootings. "
This or armed security guards. We need to make schools a less vulnerable place. You can attempt to ban firearms but we're too far into the muck here. It'll never happen and even if it does people will not surrender their weapons. There is no easy solution here.
So a gun fight in schools is the answer... i think not. 
"Okay the number of auto playing videos on that story basically made it impossible to even read, wow."
"I don't think relying on a teacher to shoot a target in a high stress situation with multiple bystanders in the area is a good idea,but that's just me. Highly trained cops shit the bed from time to time in shootouts, how well do you think the art teacher is going to perform? "
I hope somebody do a compilation of Trump’s stupid ideas. 
"I came to reddit to get away from the polarized political BS......why is anything dramatic/tragic that happens always, if not instantly, correlated to some 'political power play'"
"Oh fuck you Trump, you don't even want to pay for basic school supplies but you're up for buying teachers expensive handguns?"
"We sometimes forget that teachers are also human and can also suffer mental illness. If teachers were perfect angels then yeah this might help, but half the news stories that come out of schools in the first place are: teacher fights student, teacher sleeps with student, teacher found bullying student, etc 

I honestly feel that the odds of an armed teacher stopping a school shooter are pretty close to the odds of an armed teacher hurting a student so the trade-off wouldn’t really solve anything"
"Fight fire with fire. Makes sense!

/s"
I asked a friend who is a high school teacher if he wanted any help shopping for his work gun and he wasn't happy. I'm confused.
"So we already pay teachers shit per hour and make them pay for their own supplies.. now they have to train to use firearms and take on the responsibility of defending their classroom? 

What the fuck, y’all? "
Please tell me there's no way a proposal like this could get legitimate support. 
"At this point in the debate, someone will mention that banks have armed security guards, so why not schools? What I have noted is that some banks have all the security measures: 1) bulletproof glass 2) armed security 3) single customer entrance.  But most banks don't have all these things - bankers have figured out that most banks are not likely robbery targets.  But, so far, it seems that every school is a possible target.  For robbing banks, the motive is clear: stealing money.  For shooting up schools, who knows what the reason is - bullying? severe mental illness?"
Probably one of the worst ideas to deal with this problem....
I'm a teacher and I reckon if I was armed in class I'd have shot at least one student by now. Why doesn't Trump just ban the production of bullets?
"The whole GOP argument is being driven by the NRA. What's the solution to guns? More guns, of course."
"This is one of the more absurd ideas floating around in the gun control debate, and for more reasons than just the fact that it would be a very bad idea to keeps guns in schools. I want you to imagine a teacher you had as an elementary student, probably a mild mannered, middle aged or young woman. Now I want you to imagine this individual carrying a loaded gun on herself during class, constantly ready to pull it out and gun down a student in the heat of combat as the student suddenly opens fire. The idea is that this teacher would engage the student in a gun battle in the middle of the classroom and shoot them down. I want you to imagine all of your past teachers having to receive firearms training and entering into the described situation above. 

This is one of the most idiotic ideas I have ever heard and if you think its a good solution you need a mental evaluation. 

Teachers don't need guns they need living wages."
"Take someone who teaches your children, arm them and expect them to take a life if the need arises. It is hella hard to hit a target with a pistol under pressure without a lot' of training"
"I'm all for guns but this is impractical, you can't force teachers to carry and it would only be effective if most Of the teachers carry and even then they would only be able to protect just their class. On top of that they would require extra training to be able to shoot in that type of situation. A more practical solution is to put school re source officers at every school and to add more of them to larger ones."
"Why stop at teachers? I say arm everyone in America! Doing that will solve the gun violence problem.... eventually. There may be lots of darvin awards, [purges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purge), battle royales etc but Americans should stabilise in an idiocracy eventually."
Good. One of the few things that he has done that I agree with.
And why happens when the next aspiring happens and that teacher accidentally takes out a couple kids returning fire?
"This was his little contribution to the debate and you could tell that it had been spoon fed to him by the gun lobby or their minions in congress.  The group wasn't having any of it, though."
"Teachers are just as likely to be violent and crazy as anybody else.  After college, I got a job teaching at the University of Idaho.  My first week, a professor [murdered a grad student](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/10/university-of-idaho-bustamante-benoit-murder-suicide.html).  She had an order of protection (stalking) issued against him.    

Records would later show that he had bipolar disorder and a past history of harassing students.  Idaho allowed him to continue carrying (under Idaho law, taking firearms away from a party subject to a protection order is discretionary and not mandatory).  

He threatened several other students with firearms.   

Arming teachers could create more violence. "
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron."
"Great idea in my opinion.

The most effective way to stop bullets coming in your direction is to send some the other direction!

I noticed something today.  I live right around the corner from a Planned Parenthood clinic.  Every hour they are open they have an armed guard.  Can anybody on the left please explain why protecting abortion doctors with guns is fine but the idea of protecting children with them sends you into a blind rage?"
"Wow, we have some serious straw man murdering going on in these comments. 

Why are you inventing all these ridiculous scenarios about forcing teachers to carry or having people who are not proficient carry or having the schools pay for the guns? None of that is what is being proposed. 
"
"Shit, in most of America it's a social, economic free for all anyways. Why not add the military element as well to make it complete? "
"Everyone should be required to carry a gun that holds a single bullet. That way no one can do too much damage, but when enough people are around, it’s a proper deterrent for someone to not shoot another person. "
Apparently he never saw what happened in the last scene in Django Unchained
"- Sir, there is an incredible level of gun violence in our society!

- Hmm, that is a pickle... You know what we need, don’t you?

- \*sigh* more guns?

- That’s right, bitches. More guns.

- *insert gun fight montage*"
"Hey maybe South Park was right

https://youtu.be/Xfq6hyE7BNQ"
This seems to be the only reasonable solution. 
The teachers weren't armed in Battle Royale.  
"Training is good. What about morality and reasoning tests? How do we know some nut of a teacher won't bring one in and snap?

Also, curious if are they legally required to take that training?

Also, how are the teachers who have had to shoot a crazed student? Is ptsd treatment available?

And if you must neutralize a kid, wouldnt it *still* be better to subdue him with tear gas or tazer or rubber gun and rehabilitate him?"
"We can't even get all the police in this country to use their guns safely, correctly, and within reason.

How the fuck are you going to arm and properly train teachers when we can't even pay them properly in the first place?"
"Not just guns. Since the shooters often have semi-automatic rifles, let's give the teachers automatic weapons, so they can safely outgun the school shooters. Maybe grenades too. "
"Let me guess, he wants exactly 0.0 regulations on it. Teachers are crazy enough to drag a student around for not standing for the flag, but sure let's arm them."
"Welcome to America, here's your standard issue gun, and a voucher for a McDonalds super size meal. "
Turns out South Park’s Matt and Trey are the best oracles of the century.
Can you describe one way we stop violent crime in the US without guns?  
"People aren't thinking big enough!!  Teachers need to be armed with nuclear weapons.  No school shooter will dare commit the act if they know that all teachers have the power to unleash nuclear hell in retribution.  Trump's been keen on nuclear quite a bit, saying we should use it more.  What a perfect way to put it to use!

Then maybe we can send some teachers over to North Korea and solve that whole mess too.  "
"Seems that the areas with armed security guards aren't experiencing shootings unlike these schools. Despite your sarcasm, the data shows it is obvious. Tell me how it would have gone if that football coach had a gun? "
They should also arm the kids with glocks.
Yes exactly. You take them off the soft target list 
"While I don't agree with arming teachers, if you blindly look at the idea it's not the worst. One or two armed gunmen are probably less likely to entire a school going up against 15+ teachers who are also armed. 

With that being said, it's a horrible idea and shows a lack of effort to finding a real solution to the problem. "
"That is like saying the best way to stop war is to take away the soldiers guns. If those teachers were armed lives would have been saved, simple as that. Tho a better idea is not to force teachers to have guns but simply to allow teachers who are qualified to carry them if they want. Now THAT is a common sense gun law."
"Other than sarcasm, is there a legitime reason not to?"
Instead of the teachers having to throw themselves in front of the bullets to save the children dont you think giving them the option to fight back is a better one?
This comment makes me wonder if there have ever been any school shootings committed by a teacher. 
Well you can conceal carry in Texas universities.
"There is an inverse correlation between students being allowed to bring guns onto school property and school shootings.  Granted, they are likely fully unrelated and some other factor is driving it all, but it is an interesting case.  Kinda like how a decline in pirates is correlated with an increase in global warming."
One day? It would take like a month lol.
"yeah, I think some mentally unstable teacher would. then they would start arguing we need to arm the students. lol, then we need a guard at every door."
Remindme! In 365 days about this
Or we'll see a dramatic increase in on the job suicides. 
I do not see this going well for the inner city schools. Many of those kids are outright disrespectful with near zero accountability
"I don't mind, if teachers put down 2 pissed off kids first.

Which seems likely.  Lot more 'disgruntled' kids than teachers at schools."
And maybe it’ll be in a fancy DC prep school with a couple congressional kids in it. Maybe they will pull their heads out of their asses if it actually affects them. 
What’s to stop a pissed off teacher from bringing a gun to school and shooting it anyway? Why do you think that now that they’re armed they’ll suddenly be gunning kids down? A gun doesn’t make you kill people.
It wouldn't even take that.  A student will assault a teacher (non lethally) and the teacher will kill the student with their weapon out of instinct or fear.  
And what is stopping one doing that right now regardless of the OP? “Oh damn I’d totally murder this kid if I only had my gun”?
Then don't get one. Did you listen to the discussion? Or did you just read headlines? He says it would be voluntary and they'd need a CHL and proficiency training. 
"You don't want to protect your kids? What, you plan on using your body as a human shield? If your kids are killed and you could have used a gun to stop it than you could have done more. Think about that."
"You want teachers to be armed body shields for kids? Fucking triple their salaries, at a start."
It’s not about forcing teachers to arm themselves. It’s just so the ones that do feel comfortable carrying that have followed state laws to conceal carry can do so. At this moment schools are gun free zones for anyone other than law enforcement. Personally if I had a job we’re getting shot is a reasonable worry I’d like to be able to carry my gun on me. Especially if I have children that need protecting. 
"I mean the state pays millions for the schools stadiums. Just thinking about some of my high school teachers having guns for my protection is a scary thought though. But then again, my school also shared a police officer with the other 2 schools in the district so he was only at the school a few hours each day, some days maybe not at all."
I'm gonna go out on a limb here to suggest that that coach who took fire to protect his students would have welcomed an opportunity to return fire. He felt an obligation to protect and only had his body to do it with. 
"When was it said that carrying would be mandatory, and the firearms would be paid for by taxpayers? From my understanding, this is something teachers can volunteer for."
"Sorry, what do school supplies have to do with this?"
Im not a part of the NRA and I think this can work well if properly implemented.
How [meta](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7z06ul/what_needs_to_be_said_on_reddit_that_nobody_wants/dukkh1c/) of you...
"Ok, im not a trump supporter but... how is that retarded? I mean it would definitely stop it. What if we had armed guards? Its definitely not retarded. Its a start. 

Edit: I was pretty optimistic but im from a tiny ass town. Never had issues like that so sorry for my ignorance. Just hoped we would have a better world. Im leaving my comment up for discussion purposes."
"The students, duh. 


^^^^^^^^/s"
Crazy teachers can already take a gun to school 
Cafeteia workers? IT? Jennifer? The possibilities are endless
What if the cops go crazy. At some point you have to trust authority to help you.
Not all right wingers like guns...
Thank you. This whole idea is so unbelievably stupid. It's like trying to solve overcrowded prisons by asking for volunteers to lock up convicts in their basements.
Now you're talking.
"They're not just more dangerous, they're *cheaper* too!"
"Yes, he did.  He never mentioned CC.  “An attack has lasted, on average, about three minutes. It takes 5 to 8 minutes for responders, for police to come in. If you had a teacher who is adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,” Trump said at the event.

You interpreted it your own way to fit your narrative.  Did I miss his mention of CC?(serious)"
"That's absolutely nuts. Leave the security of children to gun enthusiasts, who'll risk their lives with no legal protection and no special training?"
"DROP YOUR PENCIL AND PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD, JONNY. YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS TO COMPLY."
"Could we just save time? Issue each desk with a handgun in attached holster, secured with a metal chain so the student can't take it with them. This bold move (sponsored by the NRA) would no doubt eliminate school shootings. Also keep those teachers on their toes."
Hi-Points for everyone!
"That's America. Keep them dumb and you can get all the votes for tax plans that fuck them over.

It's sinking in that I'm not proud to live here. I do love my state, which may as well be a foreign country to the rest of the US at this point."
"He doesn't understand, the books teach them Math and history, the gun is there to teach them ethics"
They make shit per hour because their job is easy as fuck.  And no they don't have to do anything.
There was already an armed security guard at Parkland.
"If lack of hardware is all that is between you and attacking a student, you should not be allowed near children."
You shouldn't be a teacher.
One?
I thought we already did that. Didn't we already do that? Are you the only one WITHOUT a gun?
"What are you talking about, that literally went over my head"
"Because teachers are not security guards. Its not and shouldn't be their job to receive firearms training and engage a student in a gun battle. Seriously can you imagine most of the teachers you had in elementary school carrying loaded guns around and being ready to pull it out and gun somebody down in the heat of combat? Its a stupid, stupid, stupid fucking idea. 

I would not be against the idea of hiring security guards for schools like Planned Parenthood does, but the idea that arming the teachers is a good solution is seriously retarded for lack of a better word."
Many schools have armed guards. My high school had a police office on campus at all times during school hours. There was a armed guard at Stoneman Douglas High school and that didn't help or deter the shooter.
"So Gun Game then?

Edit: wait no, that's One in the Chamber."
"If I turn a corner and see someone getting shot, how do I know if they are a random murderer or a regular citizen putting down the random murderer? Am I due a shooting if I make the wrong call?"
"Too bad we all have to put up with the sequel, *Donald Unhinged.*"
"The same could be said of anyone.

 Statistically though, Concealed Carry permit holders are extremely law abiding, committing vastly fewer crimes than any other demographic to the tune of 12.8 convictions per 100,000 as compared to the 103 per 100,000 amongst police officers, and 3,813 convictions per 100,000 for the general populace.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814691"
"1. If a teacher would to snap, I’m sure they wouldn’t worry about being allowed to bring a gun to school, i.e. one of the “untrained” teachers could take a gun to school and shoot it up 
2. Probably so, if the school is a gun free zone with exceptions, then the training is probably legally necessary to become an exception.
3. I’m sure PTSD treatment would be covered by insurance, hell most schools have on school counselors.
4. No, if you had to shoot a kid, going at him with a taser, tear gas, or rubber gun would be stupid. If a taser could’ve been used to end the situation, then you never needed to shoot him in the first place."
"Well, if the teachers can already carry a gun outside of school, then what stops them from snapping and bringing it to school to shoot people?  I guess the same logic, reason, decency, temperament, etc., that you already depend on to not get shot or stabbed by random people all the time.  Allowing teachers who can already carry around you and your kids at the mall, the movies, the park, the playground, the grocery store, church, etc., the chance to carry at school and offering them extra training seems reasonable to me.  They don't become more dangerous by entering the school, and they can already carry around kids everywhere else."
"If someone has a gun, and is using it, using less than lethal options is a sure fire way to get killed immediately. End the threat, sort out anything else later"
Those who are licensed to conceal carry have a crime rate that is almost non-existent. 
Too many questions
"""Why would you need to train them when they can all just pray at the start of every class and have the power of the Lord guide their aim?""

-Betsy DeVos probably

"
Another question I have is how the fuck are we going to pay for that? Not all school districts can afford guns for staff.
"Have to pay for teaching materials out of their own pockets when they're already living on the margins. Let's make work as armed security guards with no hazard pay too.

It's not like a shooter will always have the element of surprise or anything right? First person you shoot is the adult, whether you know they have a gun or not.

Then you mow the rest down. Great fucking solution! Fuck."
"Pffff, just take a bunch of drill sergeants and make them into teachers."
When was the last time someone called for more gun control laws when a cop shot someone though?
ever seen altered carbon we should put a safety AI in charge of the school with automated gatlings guns in everyhallway. 
"You're thinking too small.

If we use a rapid airborne delivery of a tranquilizer,  we can sedate the entire school. "
"Inside of a building, I would rather have a pistol when taking on a shooter than a rifle.  The shooter doesn't know who is armed and who isn't and a pistol is easily concealed and e achier to handle.  They also have far better stopping power than an AR15 with 5.56. It's why 90% of gun deaths are from pistols."
"Mortars and RPGs should be available too, but for safety reasons should remain in the storeroom unless required."
Oh oh lets weaponise those classroom pets!  Gopher's with IEDs and / or head mounted laser systems.

Make Americans Grenadiers Again?
"You’ll need to also make body armour for teachers, since a skilled gunman could shoot them and then acquire their weapon.

So in other words, you’ll need to:

1) Arm teachers with semi-automatic firearms and train them to use these weapons.
2) Build weapons lockers in schools where teachers can pick up and deposit their weapons at the beginning and end of each school day.
3) Purchase bulletproof vests for all teachers and make it mandatory for teachers to wear it.

It seems expensive and time-consuming to me, but I guess it’s a small price to pay so a third of Americans can own as many guns as they want."
"I'm trying to work out how many of the teachers I've had seem like they'd be capable with a gun even after training, and the only ones i can think of are the ones I wouldn't want to have a gun in the first place."
Super size isn't even offered anymore.
That school had an armed policeman there and this still happened.
"Parkland had armed guards. Columbine had armed guards. 

The real question is, if armed guards with formal training whose full time job is to protect against threats aren't sufficient for solving this problem, how is handing guns to untrained, inexperienced, underpaid, overworked teachers (whose job is to educate and keep 40+ teenagers focused at a time) going to solve the problem? "
">Seems that the ~~areas with armed security guards~~ countries without easy access to guns aren't experiencing shootings unlike these schools. Despite your sarcasm, the data shows it is obvious. Tell me how it would have gone if that ~~football coach~~ expelled student didn't have a gun? 

"
What data?
"I can see how it seems like a good idea, but I think the concerns are laid out pretty well in this thread:

1.  How many shootings will there be because a teacher overreacts, or a student steals their gun?  (thinking back on all the teachers I had, there are few who I feel would have even wanted a gun, much less been competent enough to use it (I don't mean that as an insult, I mean competent in gun safety, use of deadly force rules, etc))

2.  An armed guard didn't stop the Florida shooting.  Even if every single teacher were armed (won't happen, many/most will refuse) a shooter could walk in, pull a fire alarm, and kill 10 or 20 before any teacher even gets a shot at them.

3.  ""the data shows it is obvious"" - sorry, but you present no data, just your own opinion that no places with armed guards ever experience shootings.  And sorry, but that opinion is wrong. "
"Pretty much the same.  Maybe plus or minus a few dead people but thats it.  If a kid pulls the fire alarm and starts shooting people in the hallway a teacher/coach/anybody with a gun is going to be useless.  Unless you would trust them to have a perfect shot in a crowded hallway.  


"
"Yea these kids are suicidal. The last one was unique only because he lived. I doubt they would think twice. I think their mind frame could be something like ""I want to die and I'm going to take out as many people as possible."" "
"The gunmen do not use logic to start with.  You have basically made teachers the first target.  (I would be jumping at them anyway, so there is that.)"
"and of course you live in a perfect world where guns are never used improperly or end up in the wrong hands.  You know, like the hands of children.  What could be wrong with adding tens if not hundreds of thousands of guns near children?  Hey, accidental deaths will skyrocket but at least we might (emphasis on might) stop a school shooting."
"It's a bad idea because it's just going after the symptom of a problem, not the disease."
"By blindly, completely ignoring every aspect, except for more guns>less guns."
"But no one would know how many it which teachers are armed. And realistically, in a crisis, none of those teachers would be worth a damn. They'd probably hurt more kids than get the shooter. "
We Wild West now. Everyone gets a revolver! Yeehaw! (I wish i was /s)
"I'd much rather be in a war with no weapons.

It might not stop the war, but it would massively reduce the number of people dying."
"Just like parents that arm themselves to protect their house, and as we all know children never get a hold of those guns and hurt either themselves or others.  Oh wait...

http://www.newsweek.com/guns-kids-third-leading-cause-death-627209

Yeah, more guns is always the answer, right?  Sure, stop maybe a couple mass shootings but accidental deaths rise more than likely creating a bigger issue.  Yet I am sure all those teachers will be super responsible, just like all those parents of kids that hurt themselves or others.

I'll let you in on a little secret, more guns is not the answer.  Just ask yourself how well an insanely well armed populous has reduced gun violence.  I'll give you a little hint, not fucking well at all.  10 times the number of firearm homicides than the 2nd most homicides for an industrialized first world country on a per capita basis (Canada BTW).  Oh, I am sure a few lives were saved while many, many more are destroyed."
The last thing I want at my kid's school is a gun in the hands of a teacher who was selected by virtue of his desire to carry a gun in a school. This vigilante thing is a nice fantasy to make your dick hard while you sniff your gun at night but in reality it would be a fucking shit show. 
It's more like saying the way to stop a fire is to dump gasoline on it so it burns out faster.
"If you've ever been a teacher, you'd know that you'd be stupid to carry a gun on you at school

You're far more likely to have it grabbed off you and used on you by some hormone-fuelled, pissed-off 15 year old, than to ever stop a school shooting"
"You are comparing a war to a school. Kindly shut the fuck up and let the grown ups talk, you quite clearly have no place in this discussion. "
"Adding more guns in a shooting situation, especially if the wielders aren't properly trained, is a bad idea. You could be confused as the shooter by police, you could kill someone with friendly fire, you might even misidentify the shooter yourself. Plus if everyone knows teachers are armed, a gunman is just going to kill the teachers first. "
How about we don't assume that there is no way to prevent school shootings in the first place. Why do we have to accept that when it doesn't happen in any other country nearly as often as it does in the US? You're presenting a false dichotomy by saying we have to choose between teachers taking bullets and teachers having guns on them at all times. How about we actually solve the systemic problems that these shootings are a symptom of instead of figuring out the best way to sacrifice teachers so that we don't have to address the real problems. 
"They are still teachers, not commandos, irrespective of how much training you provide them.

Arming teachers and expecting them to protect students will only increase the risk of more children dying from friendly fire. "
"Sorry, but I think that's narrow thinking.  Sure, if we imagine a scenario in a vacuum then a teacher who happens to have a gun (which they can use well) could stop a shooter.  But we're not in a vacuum, we're in reality where introducing thousands of guns into school will have real consequences.  How many teachers would put them in a drawer where kids could get them?  How many teachers will draw them and maybe use them in situations where deadly force wan't required?  "

"There would likely be a lot more, if they were all armed."
And all Kansas universities 
"or, since this is america, the land of the fucked, a week."
There are already numerous cases of teachers using [mace and stun guns](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2010/12/01/southern-poverty-law-center-files-federal-lawsuit-targeting-use-mace-birmingham) to discipline students. I can't imagine guns would go much better.
"Kids do it every day, care to suggest a better idea? (Teachers could just walk in with the guns like every other attack that happens but they don’t.)"
"If it’s readily available, in a moment of rage. I think so. "
Yeah.  I could easily see a student pissing off a teacher enough that they pull a gun.  Its a lot different when your gun is at home and out of reach rather then in your desk/purse/shirt.  
"> You don't want to protect your kids?

I like how the solution to this is giving teachers guns.. not fixing the problems in our society with guns and mental health. 

"
Not everyone wants the emergency seat on an airplane 
"Stop with the 'you don't want to protect kids?' bullshit. You're either a moron or a paid shill with an agenda. Every other civilized country on the planet has a handle on this problem and none had to resort to arming teachers.    
Think about that."
How is giving a gun to somebody that doesn't want to use a gun protecting the kids? Putting a gun in the hands of somebody that doesn't want to use a gun in a class full of children where there was previously no gun. Is it safer for the kids in the 99.99% of the time when there is no gunman. Think about that.
Boy the fucking mental gymnastics you have to pull up say something this absurd. Like my fuck are you actually serious?  
"The thing is, they shouldn't have to have one in the first place. This is not the right move."
why would a teacher in these situations want to give up their own lives so gun fanatics could be placated
"I’m currently in college and studying to be a teacher, and I am not physically strong. It would be extremely easy for a high schooler to overpower me a d take the gun. It would lead to so many more problems."
"You have got to be kidding me.....

Protect your kids? Teachers are there to educate kids. There should be enough laws, barriers, and security in place that teacher never has to ""protect"" their *students*."
That teacher is far more likely to kill an innocent bystander than the gunman. Think about that.
How about you stop sending armed killers through school gates. Where do you even find so many armed killers?
"I think they want to protect the kids by not having a gun at all in the classroom, like i don't know the rest of the first world. Having a gun in the class room opens the door to all kinds of problems. What if the teacher does not store the gun properly or is over powered by a high school kid and the gun is taken from them? They miss the target and hit a bystander. There job is teach our kids
"
You are indeed going out on an outrageous limb. You can't possibly speak for the dead without imposing your values and politicizing him. 
"What percent of teachers do you think are going to volunteer for this? If it's not an overwhelming majority, then this solves nothing, even if the idea had merit to begin with. "
Who's paying to train and arm all these teachers? They already have to buy their own pencils and notebooks for their students in many cases
"Funding. We can’t afford basic supplies for classrooms, let alone the requisite training or the firearms themselves. "
"It can't be properly implemented without millions spent on supplying the guns and training, not to mention a huge pay increase for teachers when you add Armed Security to their already extensive job descriptions."
"Enlighten us. What would ""properly implemented"" look like? How much is it going to cost to train all of our public school teachers to be an effective police force? Are we going to increase their salaries to match their new job description (which apparently includes a risk to their lives)? Where is this money going to come from if the classrooms already do not have money for teaching supplies? "
The most effective deterrent for gun violence is knowing that everyone else has a gun.  Go to a gun shop where every employee is carrying on their hip and “lemme start some shit” doesn’t even come to mind. 
You only post in /r/mensrights lol
"It wouldn't stop it, most of the kids who go in these are confirmed to be or have been suicidal, a lot of them taking their own lives.

It's time to stop going after the symptom and cure the disease."
"It wouldn't stop it for the same reason several shootings weren't stopped by the armed guards present. 

That's besides the fact hundreds of thousands of teachers would need weapons training and would need to deal with the fact they might be called to shoot someone they know or knew in their workplace."
The school had armed guards. My highschool had armed police and that was early 2000's.
"The Florida school that was just shot up had an armed guard. Not to mention, if you felt like shooting up a school you just have to start with the armed guard."
"I mean, it’s already a huge issue with unwarranted police shootings. And they are highly trained, these teachers would not be. Not a great point."
Cops are closely monitored for dangerous behavioral issues.

"No one has mentioned departments buying guns for teachers, and the idea has been tossed around for years that teachers should be allowed to CC at work. That's been the proposal each time, there's nothing yet suggesting this is different. Therefore, this is the logical assumption at this point until there are more facts. 

You're ignoring the past to fit your own narrative. "
Which state is that? I might have to move there...
"Yeah, ok dude. "
nice
Maybe people down voting should tell me how hard it is to be a high school teacher.  15 year olds have to go the same hours and then go to their after school jobs.
"Many of the schools targeted have had armed security guards. But most schools have multiple entrances, and in the chaos of a mass shooting, a security guard or teacher has two choices: help children get to safety, or go after the shooter(s).  It seems in almost all of these cases, the guard/teachers have focused on getting the children near them to safety. "
Conservative estimate
Mores the pity and another glaring neon sign of the obvious and blatant devolution of our times...sigh
"You do of course realize this is 100% voluntary and that they would get training.

And yes, I could imagine some of my teachers doing that as quite a few were former military."
"You're right, one guard can't handle an entire school for sure.

This problem is WAY bigger than just adding guards.  We have to have better background checks, better mental health care, figure out what's going on with young men in this country.  What's causing them to go off the rails so often?  You know damn well if this was young women doing this, we would mobilize heaven and Earth to find the cause!  But because it's boys, no real urgency.

Get outta here with your facts! No one wants to hear that! 
"Teachers don't have classroom supplies bought for them already. If they want to teach, they'll need to supply their own body armor (optional) and gun(s), and obtain a concealed carry permit on their own time and money.

"Yeah, if that teacher in Sandy Hook was armed, she might've hit one of her kids by mistake!

The first person a gunman targets in these scenarios is likely dead anyways armed or not.
"I would disagree. Most gunmen are very logical in where they are when the shooting starts. Their goal is a high body count so it stands to reason they will pick “soft targets” with no security or defense. Ever wonder why these gunmen are targeting schools and not sports NFL Stadiums with armed police at the entrance? None of these killers wanted to be killed as soon as they started shooting, perhaps eventually but their goal was not to kill 1 person before they were killed themselves. Because they want a high body count before they are stopped. Arming teachers and training them will cause a shooter to rethink their target and could prevent the shooting overall. "
">gunmen do use logic

Not that I support arming teachers, but for the sake of argument of the statement. Could you give me an example or 2 of recent mass shootings where a gunman opened fire on a group of people where there were more than a couple of people prepared to return fire?

Almost all of these mass shootings have a simple concept in common, premeditation. There has to be sound logic in an idea. Go somewhere with a minimal risk of being stopped immediately and inflict as much damage as possible. 

The only exception I can think of is the Dallas police shootings. I could be wrong though"
This makes no sense at all. There is only one first target and as soon as that shot goes off the other teachers become aware
"That last sentence of my statement said exactly what you just said. 

Again, I'm not a firm supporter of arming teachers, but if you consider both ends of the argument there's more than just saying ""putting guns in schools is a bad idea"". The problem with debates like these is there is more than one solution, albeit not so popular, and most people have inherent tunnel vision that only leads to their proposed solution. "
What? 
"You can't kill ten teachers in ten different rooms ""first"". A shooter would be far more disinclined to attack if he thinks someone will shoot back, and friendly fire is still far less casualties than someone dumping bullets into people without any reason to hurry.

17 people were killed and it would have been more if he didn't just quit the assault
"
I agree that it is a symptom. I just think that any solution is going to be a long term thing and that in the short term this is likely the most effective way to at least mitigate the tragedies. In the long term we should improve the mental health care. Its not getting enough attention and it must be taken care of.
"Thousands of guns in a single school? A bit unclear in your wording there. 

Require any and all firearms to be stored in an undisclosed location in the room they work in which is only known to the police and required administration of the school. Fines, jailtime, etc, should be severe in cases where they have misused a firearm and if they want to be trusted with a firearm it should require very high standards of firearm training as well as first aid and perhaps medical training on the treatment of gunshot wounds in particular. The training should be paid for by the teachers that want the training but their pay should be very much increased upon successful completion of the training. "

There are so, so many bad things that can and will result from this. This won't stop school shootings, only give us different problems. "
"A better idea than charging untrained, inexperienced educators with the duty of defending students against semi-automatic gunfire?

"The point is that I've yet to hear any politician say that this should be a *requirement*, or that taxpayers should pay to arm teachers. If you've heard otherwise, please share."
They could use their personal guns. I'm sure anyone willing to volunteer has one already. I know a few teachers that have guns at home. A training program would be a one time fee that's usually under  $100. Unlike school supplies which have to be bought again each time they are used up. You're comparing a cost of under $1000 to a cost in the tens of thousands. It's really not a valid comparison. 
Why don't we let teachers use any guns they already own? He never said anything about buying guns for them. Training costs under $100. School supplies are in the thousands of dollars range because you have to keep buying them when they run out. It's not really a very good comparison. 
">pay increase for teachers

LOL"
"1. Its not mandatory, its optional.

2. It would probably cost a decent ammount depending how many teachers are willng to do it. We need more funding for schools anyways so just roll that in with it. 

3. As it is optional those that have chosen more responsibility should certainly be paid more. I would say maybe double. 

4. No idea where the money would come from. Im not an expert. "
"Absolutely not. Somebody who wants attention from shooting up a school is going to revel at the idea of going down in a blaze of glory. And bravo, you just equated schools with gun shops. What's the difference, right? "

"The most effective deterrent for gun violence is to get rid of the guns. It's not as if America is the first place to think about this.

Says child. 
Can you stop talking above my head and explain what your post meant
"You know how many of my teachers were former military? None. The huge majority of teachers are young/middle aged women (not saying that there are no women in the military or that a woman couldn't shoot a gun, but the huge majority of teachers are not the combat types. There's no way this could ever be a feasible solution."
"It's odd that having to get that license isn't infringing on anyone's rights, either. Huh..."
"Decriminalize drugs, flat-out legalize the least harmful ones, take the money saved from not waging the drug war and put it towards impoverished communities. Congrats, you just eliminated over half of those because now gangs aren't a thing. "
The large majority of that is gang violence with illegally acquired guns. A gun ban wont stop that.
"In response to 2) ""A person commits an offense if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly possesses or goes with a firearm ... on the physical premises of a school or educational facility... unless pursuant to written regulations or written authorization of the institition. - Texas Penal Code 46.03

https://www.tasb.org/Services/Legal-Services/TASB-School-Law-eSource/Business/documents/firearms_on_dist_property.pdf

They must possess written authorization from the ISD to carry, else it is illegal. Since the ISD requires the training in order to a part of the program, then they must undergo said training in order to get the written authorization."
"Okay 1.) Obviously, if a teacher is allowed to carry a gun on a gun free zone then they need some sort of legal allowance to do so, or else they’d be breaking the law.
2.) Probably not. My middle school had a counselor to deal with that type of stuff, my highschool didn’t. There’s no law that requires that, but take a look to what’s going on in Florida. Plenty of people miles away from the shooting are missing school because of what happened. One could assume, that if a gun had to be fired in school, no one would pressure students or teachers to go school the next day.
And as for 4.) never take rubber bullets to a real gun fight. It’s not “tactically stupid” it’s just plain stupid. Rubber bullets do not incapacitate. The only chance you have of incapacitating a shooter with rubber bullets is by shooting him in the head. You can look up how many people have been killed by rubber bullets to the head yourself. Point is, if a teacher goes after a school shooter with rubber bullets, the only thing that’s going to end is the teacher’s life."
"Don't be retarded. There's a reason rubber bullets are ""less-than-lethal"" and not ""non-lethal"", and they're in no way a guaranteed stop. Tazers can be blocked by thick clothing. And tear gas? Are you fucking serious? Did you maybe mean pepper spray, instead of that stuff that comes in grenades? 

You need to sit down and consider that you're currently opposing the defensive killing of people who are trying to commit acts of mass murder. "
Who doesn't have guns?  Are you saying no teachers in Texas already own guns?  I seriously doubt that.
Ok just let me know which one is better then a high capacity rifle. And that you can deploy faster then he can shoot you.
"Tear gas does not do much to a guy with a gun. You might disturb his aim but you’re trying to protect a crowd of kids. Not to mention you might gas the kids you’re trying to help. Tasers have a range of like 15 feet or something. I wouldn’t get that close to a guy with a knife let alone a guy with a rifle shooting at me. Rubber bullets are weird. They can be lethal in certain situations, but if you’re going to be lethal might as well use real bullets and hope the guy doesn’t bleed out by the time the paramedics come. You also have to take into account that a wounded person can still fire a gun. Unless you have one of those high tech sonic guns that are the size of a truck, less than lethal isn’t going to cut it."

They have but still banning a single style of gun will simply change the gun a criminal will use. It doesnt solve the problem.
Ar15 is pretty rare to hear about even in mass killings. The media even got one of the other shootings facts incorrect by saying the gun used was an ar15 when in reality it was a shotgun. That lead to the joke that every gun the media sees is either an ar15 or a glock. The ar15 is very difficult to conceal which is probably why it isnt used often. As i mentioned in another post banning one style of weapon will simply change the gun a criminal will use. The effectiveness argument only goes so far as the reality is an ar15 is only slightly more effective than other weapons. Someone with a basic shotgun can do real damage and if they have practiced loading quickly the rate of fire will increase its effectiveness. Banning an ar15 is a very silly and stupid argument. The only way is a total ban of all guns. And dear lord even that has many of its own issues given our gun culture and number of guns in America. A black market of illegal unregistered firearms would be absolutely terrifying.

Are there any gun regulations (existing or future) that you support? Should there be an age you have to reach before you can buy a gun, for instance? I hope you understand that the people advocating for ""gun control"" aren't advocating for ""gun abolition"". They're trying to figure out how we can stop the insane number of innocent citizens and children who are getting killed in our country. There has to be a better way that mitigates this problem and also retains a reasonable right to gun ownership. "

Do you understand what plus or minus means? It means it could actually be worse. You want an inexperienced shooter taking shots in a crowded and chaotic situation?
"Also, if it's not broadcast which teachers have guns, then when Mr. Science starts shooting, it's very possible people think HE is the shooter. 

Adding more guns to the mess is insanity."
Sorry but I dont think creating additional chaos and danger to an already dangerous situation is a good idea.  
"> Could you give me an example or 2 of recent mass shootings where a gunman opened fire on a group of people where there were more than a couple of people prepared to return fire?

But no matter how many teachers are armed, it will always be this way. If someone wants to walk into a public place and start shooting innocents for no reason, they will always have the element of surprise. Even if there are 15 teachers with guns in the whole school, they're not going to be facing them at the same time. What do you suggest happens when the teachers know that there is an active shooter? Instead of locking their classrooms down, they are supposed to go hunt the shooters together? "
">There has to be sound logic in an idea

First, plenty of ideas have no sound logic

As for the rest. there was that shooting (sorry, don't remember which one, there have been so many) where the shooters ended up at a Wal Mart (I think).  An armed civilian shot at one of them, not realizing the other shooter was behind him.  He was killed. 

The larger point - sure, we can imagine a scenario where a shooter tries to attack a crowd where 20 people have guns and he is stopped after the first few shots.  But equally easy to imagine are 100 little scenarios where that many people with guns leads to a shooting here and there, all of which add up to a toll as bad or worse than the mass shootings they prevented.  

Or I can simply imagine shooters changing tactics - if you know every teacher has a gun maybe you go in and pull the fire alarm (or wait til between classes, either way the hallway is full).  You have a semi-auto rifle with a 30 round magazine, so in about 30 or 45 seconds you're able to get off 60 shots into a crowded hallway.  Maybe then the teacher kills you, but in most mass shootings the gunman has a death wish anyway. "

My concern is just ""allowing"" teachers to be armed will be pointed to as THE solution, no matter how many teachers volunteer or how well they are trained. That should not and can not be the only response to the horrific school shooting epidemic we have in this country. "
The point is that we don’t have the funds for what we already need so where is the money going to come from? If we are allocating more money to schools there are far more helpful ways to use it. Our police aren’t even fully competent so I doubt our teachers will be. 
"If very few teachers opt in to this, is it going to really be any different than it is now? And if we're prepared to double a teacher's salary to carry a gun, why not just hire extra armed security instead so that they can be constantly vigilant? In terms of where the money should come from, would you be in favor of a hefty gun tax to pay for it? If gun owners think this is the best solution, then maybe they should pick up the tab. For every gun I purchase, I would have to pay an extra 100% to fund the price of a gun for a teacher. That should be a good deterrent to school shooters, no?"
Good luck with that.

There was just a massive movement to BAN assault rifles... even though hundreds of times more people are killed using hand guns. I do believe the legal age should be raised to 21, but banning weapons is absolutely ridiculous. It won't change the statistics. It won't help and all the data throughout history reinforces that affirmation."

"You're talking as if I'm saying these teachers need to be prepared to squad up like a video game and go hunting together, and that's not my intention at all. If a gunman were going class to class (like what happened), kicking the door in and opening fire inside and someone inside was to be waiting since they've already heard gunfire they would be more prepared. As I've already stated, these mass shootings don't occur at a place where there is already numerous armed people. These cowards prey on the vulnerable and unprepared."
"That school board link was a member planting bombs in a high school back in the 20’s. Teachers have easier access to what it would take to shoot up a school and terrorize it than any student yet there’s no national headlines about teachers shooting students. There’s more links for teachers with guns in their cars saving kids than there are of them killing them. If someone we deemed fit to be a teacher is a responsible gun owner that practices concealed carrying, than I see no reason for them to not have one. I don’t think laws are what’s stopping teachers from shooting kids. I really don’t think there’s a teacher out there wishing if only the school allowed them to carry they would be able to shoot all the kids. If they are going to they would, but they haven’t cause they don’t. "
"Ok.. So how is your point relevant to pointing out that the comment  

> No money for crayons but the state's gonna pay for every teacher to have a Ruger. 

isn't valid because no one is proposing that the state pay for any firearms? And did I say this was a solution, or are you looking for a soapbox to stand on?"
I don't really understand the idea of schools not having the funding to increase security. Several schools around here have doors that automatically lock when class is in session. That alone would have prevented this last shooting. A friend teaches at a school that has police stationed in the parking lot all day also. Schools in bad neighborhoods have had metal detectors at the entrances since the 80s. How come some public schools can afford security and others can't? Why not do a fundraising drive to raise money for security? I'm sure lost parents would gladly help out in any way they can to make sure their kids are safe. 
"Pretty sure that in every class, there's 1 or 2 students that a teacher would love to see dead, which in itself is a reason to not put guns into the hands of teachers. On top of that there would be students who don't feel safe risking their lives to go to class with certain teachers, and might want to bring a gun of their own for their own personal protection."
Okaaaay
What...why the hell are you asking me about my personal gun ownership. Has absolutely nothing to do with this conversation.
"Israel is real utopia of peace. Good model for us to base school security on.

I also can't think of a single teacher in my entire life who I knew was ex-military. Teachers are very often scholarly and peaceful (at least I think they should be)... not the type of person you'd expect to handle gunfights well. "
"Just how thick are you? How am I falsely equivocating them? If you decriminalize drugs, you're removing a massive pressure on impoverished communities and taking revenue away from gangs and cartels. Focus on helping the impoverished communities that create gangs, and you'll come close to eliminating them. The majority of gun crime and homicide is gang related. If you actually want to save lives, help communities instead of screeching about scary black rifles. "
"You are proposing to make the majority of the population defenseless against anyone who decides ""Fuck the law"". How would you propose metal detectors be implemented? At every door to a public building? Shit, Brought my car keys with me, Guess i get to be searched. Student has a binder with metal rings? Shit, well i guess they just lost their privacy. While i do agree metal detectors are good in high risk areas, having them at EVERY public building would be a huge pain in the ass and infringe on everyones right to privacy.

Banning guns doesnt stop those who decide they don't want to follow the law, It only hurts those who follow the law. 

Also, Expect alot of ""Boating accidents"" once you ask every gun owner to hand theirs in. That stuff is not cheap or easy to obtain."

"If a teacher volunteers to carry and be trained to do so, how is that any different?  In fact, that same teacher can already carry everywhere else without that special training.  This isn't a proposal to force all teachers to carry regardless of their desire or ability.

"Call spiderman, got it"
"I think the phrase ""run up get gunned up"" works here."
How would you go about taking the gun from the shooter? I mean I don't agree with arming teachers against students either but I am not following your logic.
"I wasn't talking about states with open carry, I was talking about individuals with open carry."
We had teachers who carried.  Our security guard carried.  Hell I went skeet shooting with my female English teacher a couple years after school.  So a really large amount.
"50% of the people in these style of threads. But when a total ban gets talked about then what happens? You expect 100% of all guns to be confiscated? There are 335+ million firearms in US right now. A big part of US gun culture is ""dont tread on me"" or ""from my cold dead hands"" so good luck getting even 10% of the guns confiscated and thus creating the largest black market of illegal firearms in the world."
"True but people need to stop pretending the end all answer to these event is banning one style of weapon. I always get downvoted but look at Columbine or many other events that didnt use ar15's.

"> As I've already stated, these mass shootings don't occur at a place where there is already numerous armed people.

First, you haven't actually given any evidence in favor of this. It may seem intuitive or obvious to you, but actually schools are probably already more armed than many other public places where there aren't mass shootings once a month. Off the top of my head: grocery stores rarely have a cadre of armed guards, yet rarely are there mass shootings there. So we ought to find evidence to support or refute this hypothesis before accepting it as true. 

Second, this is my point. The shooters will never be facing numerous armed people. If they were going to be deterred by facing a single untrained teacher at a time, why weren't they deterred by actual armed security guards? "

These people were all concealed carry licensed, which is apparently as much training is usually required to be an armed teacher.

Also again, at the heart of this, that kid shouldn't be able to get a gun in the first place. A teacher should never have to shoot a kid."
"It strikes me as disingenuous to not admit that the reason people are discussing arming teachers is in response to the Parkland massacre and a proposed solution to mass shootings in schools. And if nobody is going to pay for it, then how is it going to get implemented? Teaches are just going to spend their nonexistent disposable income to arm and train themselves? It sounds completely unrealistic. "
"It has EVERYTHING to do with it actually.  If you've never shot a gun or owned a gun or really have much in terms of knowledge about them then I would say you frankly have no idea who could do what in a situation like that.

I know quite a few ""middle aged women"" as you put it who could very astutely send accurate fire back in the direction of the mass shooter!

So back to the original question, how much firearms experience do you have?  I'm guessing it's zero."
"Good point, take guns from criminals too!

Tell me, how many mass shootings and gangs of illegally armed criminals roam Japan and Australia?"
"We wouldn't need to defend ourselves from anyone if nobody had guns.

We could easily detect an outlaw if he's a private citizen with a gun.

Police wouldn't need to carry guns for defense, they could be like english bobbies and the military or homeland defense can have guns to deal with killers.

Look at australia, japan. They do not have these problems.

Why don't we just live in the wild west with everyone shooting each other? Civilization demands that nobody needs the power to kill each other, not everybody."

"Look at Sandy hook and tell me how many security guards there were there. How many are there at Columbine and other schools that were shot? They choose schools because they’re “soft targets”. Lots of people and you can be sure none of them are armed, because it’s illegal. A supermarket is more spread out and there’s the possibility that anyone there could be a licensed concealed weapons holder. Why don’t shooters target Professional stadiums? Those are packed with people? They don’t because they have armed security at every entrance. There was a comic conventions a few years ago in Texas with a “draw Muhammad” competition. 2 men drove up and we’re going to shoot it up when they were gunned down by security. Obviously having armed security works. It only makes sense that arming teachers should work. It would be cheaper than hiring individual guards and would allow for more people who are trained on a campus"
