"Steve Kelly You are not entirely correct and only by half. One should tell the whole story and not half truths. During his tenure, U.S. President James K. Polk oversaw the greatest territorial expansion of the United States to date. Polk accomplished this through the annexation of Texas in 1845, the negotiation of the Oregon Treaty with Great Britain in 1846, and the conclusion of the Mexican-American War in 1848, which ended with the signing and ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848. The Battle of Veracruz brought within the control of the United States the future states of Texas, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Washington, and Oregon, as well as portions of what would later become Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, and Montana. Following Texas‚Äô successful war of independence against Mexico in 1836, President Martin van Buren refrained from annexing Texas after the Mexicans threatened war. Accordingly, while the United States extended diplomatic recognition to Texas, it took no further action concerning annexation until 1844, when President John Tyler restarted negotiations with the Republic of Texas. His efforts culminated on April 12 in a Treaty of Annexation, an event that caused Mexico to sever diplomatic relations with United States. Tyler, however, lacked the votes in the Senate to ratify the treaty, and it was defeated by a wide margin in June. Shortly before he left office, Tyler tried again, this time through a joint resolution of both houses of Congress. With the support of President-elect Polk, Tyler managed to get the joint resolution passed on March 1, 1845, and Texas was admitted into the United States on December 29. Texas was also bought from Mexico in said treaty.

PS Edit: Mr. Kelly I am pretty sure that your ancestors were immigrants as well. So in this reference it is merely the pot calling the kettle black concept. As for me? I am half Irish and the rest is Native American so I do believe I have a little bit more free range to school you on these types of concepts.

There is no real Democrat ideology that promotes inclusion . It is a method of diversity the through division. Ask the following question.Why do they do it.Ask why they want to pay billions supporting illegal immigrants ? What rational reason do they have. This is purely a plan to destroy our culture and country.The Democrats have abused the voters registration system since the civil war ended. They preyed on immigrants and poor communities for power. There corrupt agenda was based on deception and unethical behavior.Then they found the big cities where easily controlled by local ward bosses. Unions where the next obvious move. Then they started to loose some voter due to Assimilation and changing attitudes. So how do we get our base bigger. Simple introduction of more immigrants 1965 Ted Kennedy pushed through a new open system. That combined with social engineering of the 60s . Now assimilation became a bad thing. Diversity through division became the the new game. Illegal immigration and was promoted and self identified special interests groups the latest and greatest ideological divide. Balkanization and divisiveness is the latest approach.Reversing this self loathing anti American values policies and bringing people together is the real issue.,0,2018-02-24 13:15:48,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

"It appears that the liberal trolls still mistakenly believe that their name calling, vulgarity and insults somehow give them the image of superiority, when in fact it only makes them appear as insecure, uneducated and bitter.

Don't be degraded to their low level, Trump supporters.  Instead, continue to employ the mature and informed tactic of posting unbiased and substantiated facts that cannot be disputed.  Their ridiculous and transparent temper tantrum responses are quickly fueling the self implosion of their own political party.

Sleep well with the knowledge that, no matter what they say or do, the trolls still [thankfully] lost the election.

"Jen Rider -- TS is a well known troll that is specifically known for inciting circular, nonsensical arguments that are in no way related to the topic at hand.

Her favorite tactic is to eventually block anyone who exposes her inaccurate liberal propaganda.  She will then  post tearful comments regarding how she was being ""bullied"" by the individual she blocked.  She has done so at least three times in the last six months. Her flaccid attempts at sympathy backfired each time, however, and only resulted in her being ""baited"" by more Trump supporters just so they could laugh at her responses.

Several of us refer to her as ""Sybil"", as she has been proven to have several accounts under different identities -- and has even admitted to it. Facebook has removed some of them, at which time she merely created new accounts.  It's pretty easy to recognize her fake profiles.  Usually the""TS"" profile will suddenly disappear, then a new one will magically begin to post hateful comments that contain the exact same word usage, grammar and punctuation.  In other words, she isn't even intelligent enough to at least attempt to change her writing style.

Playing with her can be quite entertaining.  After all, sometimes a cat likes to amuse itself by toying with its prey before going in for the kill.  In the end, the cat always wins.",0,2018-02-25 01:41:02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

"Dian Crystal On October 18, 1996, she received an H-1B visa for skilled workers that allowed her to work legally in the United States. Five years later, she got a green card.

The question is what exactly happened between August and October of 1996, given evidence obtained by the AP suggesting that she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between September 10 and October 15. As Dara Lind has written for Vox, there are a couple of possible explanations here:

B-visas are often issued to ‚Äútemporary business visitors‚Äù ‚Äî who are here for ‚Äúbusiness activities‚Äù but not allowed to work. It‚Äôs for people who are going to professional conferences, for example, or networking with associates ‚Äî or even negotiating a contract for future employment. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services website explains that activities under a business visitor visa ‚Äúmust be directly connected with and part of your work abroad.‚Äù

Legally, working for pay for a US company is a clear violation of the terms of that visa, but it‚Äôs not exactly intuitive that someone coming on a business visa, especially if she‚Äôd been working as a model in Europe, wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to work.

This summer, when questions about Melania‚Äôs immigration status first came up, a Politico article cited a labor standards advocacy group‚Äôs claim that ‚Äú[i]t was a common practice in the 1990s in New York for less scrupulous agencies to bring in foreign models to work illegally on temporary business and tourist visas.‚Äù If Melania Trump was on the same sort of visa as everyone else she worked with, it‚Äôs totally possible that she was simply being misled as to its legality.

Then again, it is also entirely possible that Melania knowingly committed visa fraud; that, in fact, she lied to US immigration officials when entering the country in August 1996 about her intentions to work while in the US. That‚Äôs not just an immigration violation but an outright federal crime.

Either way, in order for Melania to have gotten a green card and then US citizenship, she would have had to attest that she hadn‚Äôt violated immigration law before ‚Äî something that now appears to be untrue.",0,2018-02-24 17:45:28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

Name any president in our country‚Äôs history and I assure you that he was not perfect!  Perfection is NOT a requirement for being our president.  You want to hold Trump accountable for many things that have NOTHING to do with running our country.  Never before has any president been held to such high standards, even when they sometimes conflicting standards.  You want to hold Trump to standards that no person can meet.  You‚Äôre undermining him, but you‚Äôre also undermining our whole country.  You‚Äôre sabotaging our country‚Äôs future; my future; your own future and the futures of all of your children and grandchildren.  
Get your head out into the sunshine and see the progress that President Trump has made, in spite of all the hate and ignorant criticism he has been dealing with. You‚Äôre an idiot!  You don‚Äôt like Trump and you want to bring him down, but you don‚Äôt have anybody to replace him with.  Do you want the ignorant and corrupt Joe Biden, the ‚Äúgaffinator‚Äù?  Would you like to have Socialist Bernie Sanders as our president?  That weak minded idiot was cheated out of a legitimate chance to be president, by Hillary Clinton.  But he fell on his own sword, rather than to contest that corruption.  He proved that it‚Äôs more important for the corrupt ‚Äúparty‚Äù to win than for truth and honesty to be served.  You‚Äôd probably much rather have Hillary, but that was already tried, and with all her corrupt money schemes to win the election; with all the cheating by the complicit moderators; all the dead people, convicts and illegals who voted, SHE LOST!
Look at what IS!  Not at what could have been.  See that Trump is doing much more for this country than Obama did in 8 years.  And that was 8 years in which he continually told us that everything we held dear was evil.  HE, a past community organizer; past do-nothing Senator and usurper to our presidency, Muslim, African, told US that we didn‚Äôt build this country.  He was nothing but an ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT himself.

"I'm Canadian....we have a complete idiot running our country..or should I say...taking family vacations on our tax dollars and embarrassing us worldwide. Those illegal immigrants that walked into Canada from the U.S. at the Manitoba border all sought asylum and are allowed to stay yet vetting was not done. One guy got frostbite last winter while walking to our border and eventually lost his fingers. He had the nerve to threaten to sue our Canadian government. So Trudope gave him automatic citizenship and free healthcare and FREE PROSTHETIC FINGERS!!!Yet he told our vets that they are asking too much! Trudeau gave 10.5 MILLION to a convicted terrorist 6 mths ago who was a prisoner at Guat.Bay.. He complained he wasn't treated well in jail and being Canadian in an American jail he felt he should have everything...so justin Trudeau gave him millions...but previous prime ministers ignored the guy because he is a terrorist! Trudeau recently let 60 ex ISIS fighters(Canadian citizens who left Canada to go fight American and Canadian soldiers)...trudeau let them return to Canada...to run free and reintegrate with society. He has given billions and billions away to tons of countries for ridiculous reasons yet he tells our vets there is no money for them. We have homeless etc. ..but he does nothing for Canada.  He made it illegal for anyone to speak negative about Muslims...but all other religions are fair game. He put in the Federal Budget 2 yrs ago that should another recession hit and Canada gets in trouble financially, that the Canadian government can and will go into citizens bank accounts and use our hard earned money to bail out Canada. The list goes on and on. He spent 200K last xmas on family vacay and got caught by ethics committee snd refuses to pay it back as he used tax payers money. The list goes on. And the world is in love with the moron. They are clueless. His spending is so out of control that it has been proven it will take THREE genetations to get out of debt....all this in 2 yrs...he has spent more than our last PM in just 2 yrs than the old PM did in 8!!

Clue sir , if the government does not put forth a climate of #1 job growth, thus economic growth , people are dependent on the government for everything from birth to the grave .... #2 if the government discourages a person's right of free speech , that  limits what you can hear , think, say and practice ,they then are your master... #3 if the government takes away your right to bear arms , they then can decide who has a right to life... #4 if the government decides who receives medical treatment, again they can decide who lives and  who does not live !! Kai the list of socialist policies  the democrats promote and the impact on the average American is being  demonstrated even today,  LOOK at the MSM ...  the movement on college campuses ,to stop some conservatives from speaking....   the  disrespect shown to people at town-hall meetings ...    the ""right to bear  arms""  under the Constitution is  under attack ,by the democrats, using  the tragic event   in Parkland  FL , and  that is sicking !!      Kai, there is conclusive proof the democrats could easily be called the  ""Communist  party of America "" BTW , look up Saul Alinsky and "" Rules for Radicals "" the very last thing Obama needed to complete , was to eliminate the  "" RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS "" .

Gracie Smola is Cuban, and I have worked as a Teachers Assistant for many years among Cubans, South Americans, and Mexicans.

Fidel Castro was a horrid dictator, and the people were very impoverished, and lived in constant fear of their lives.

"Donna Yurek Akers. The Cubans that came to Miami, nearly two million of them, were running away from Cuba or simply left the island with their money and their investments to get away from the Fidel Castro Government. They did settle in Florida, the US Government encouraged their arrival in the US, called them refugees from a commie Government, eased their access to Landed Immigrant status, green cards and social security and further assisted them by passing the wet-foot/dry foot law that allowed them to stay in the US once they set even one foot in any of the beaches in Florida. Their arrival was a US ploy carried out by every Government-of-turn at the White House who used the Cubans as convenient stoolies for the US anti-communism propaganda against Castro and similar Government out-favor with the US elsewhere in this Hemisphere. Some Cubans became millionaires as heads of the US Government-approved Radio and TV stations working out of Miami and aiming non-stop diatribes to Cuba on daily political tirades. Funny, Haitians who made the same dangerous cross from the island to Florida got the opposite treatment. They were immediately returned to Haiti. Now Trump is playing games with DACA. Not a word mentioned about returning Cuban to the island. And yes, US taxpayers have funded their trips and their stay in the US to this day.

Pat Fritz I'm really sorry that youve been made to believe that your situation is a result of illegals taking from the system. I think you should have more benefits available to you but taking away benefits that dont exist from others isnt going to give you anything.

Can't support illegals since they don't draw any govt funds. The ones who took from social security is our govt and they dont want to nor can't repay what they borrowed.

"Profound in his vision, confident in his command, peerless in his patriotism, President DONALD J. TRUMP is the world's premier statesman. The present situation in our country is yet another clear testimony to the wisdom and justice of President DONALD J. TRUMP's line of simultaneously developing economic construction and improving our defence capacity and the policy of making the US military a cadre army, strengthening it, and effectively arming the entire people and fortifying the whole country with a border wall, travel restrictions, and merit-based immigration policies. 

Today, our great nation can adhere to founding principles without being affected by foreign threats and blackmail, because it has, by its own effort, built a powerful defence capacity which has the strength to defend the security of the country and the gains of democracy, by hard struggle and strenuous efforts under the wise direction of the leaders in the past. If we had not built up our own strength but relied on the strength of others, we would have been in a very difficult position, in fact, we would have been incapable of stubbornly resisting the enemy in the serious situation we now face. 

We should have great pride and the confidence to continue with the implementation of the self-defensive military line of our nation, and thereby strengthen the defensive power of the People still further, and if the enemy dares to invade us, we should fight bravely, thereby once again demonstrating to the whole world the invincible might of the heroic American people rallied in single-hearted unity around our outstanding President DONALD J.

Like, why does it matter where they are sitting if we are just paying for them to sit?",0,2018-02-24 12:48:31,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

"Judy Johnson Hatred is a ‚Äúheart‚Äù sin, and any hateful thought or act is an act of murder in God‚Äôs eyes for which justice will be demanded, possibly not in this life but at the judgment. 

So heinous is the position of hate before God that a person who hates is said to be walking in darkness, as opposed to the light (1 John 2:9, 11). 

Hatred is a poison that destroys from within, producing bitterness that eats away at your heart and mind.

Good Luck with that one if you want to keep half your assets even if it is just telling her what to do if you hit her you may lose all of it and spend months or years in jail depending on how serious if she press charges and if it is a first time offense it could be years if all 3 come into play.  Have a good day but do not beat your wife or kill your 9 year old daughter because she did not recite a verse in the Koran correctly,  Why not stop this Sharia BS and make them conform to American laws if they want to come here,  We pay welfare to his 4 wives he drives an Escalade and the taxpayers foot the bill for all of it.  If the ones from Mexico want in they can do so legally like the millions did before then.  The law to build the wall was passed years ago as we gave Ted Kennedy the number of immigrants he wanted.  However it backfired on him he wanted Irish and they did not win the lottery.  So he got screwed and the US got screwed and decades later we still have not finished the wall.

"Jim Villella ‚Äì In all the years that Sanders has been in office, what has he actually been able to accomplish in fighting the traitorous trade and immigration policies that have destroyed the real American economy and the economic future of the American people?

President Trump has only been in office for 11 months ‚Äì Clinton 96 months, Bush 96 months, Obama 96 months and Sanders had what about 30-years in the Senate.

Time to level the playing field using common sense instead of political BS, tokenism and rhetoric.

Once we level the playing field, Trump and others can bring the manufacturing of their products back to the USA ‚Äì As it stands right now, it's like a contractor trying to compete with other contractors that are hiring off the books illegal aliens ‚Äì That contractor ends up being forced to do the same or go out of business. 

Although, I like that Sanders helped bring some of the core economic issues out into the light of day ‚Äì He's way too far to the left and can be more easily marginalized by both parties and the corporate media as some crazy old loon, which he actually may be.

In all the years that Sanders has been in office, what has he actually been able to accomplish in fighting our traitorous trade and immigration policies?

Let's face it, if it wasn't for Trump our bought and paid for puppet politicians and media would still be talking about peripheral social issues like gay marriage and abortion, rather than the core issues that have destroyed the real American economy and the economic future of the American people ‚Äì It's called polarize and distract ‚Äì  But this time it's not working, because most Americans are finally seeing through the media manipulation ‚Äì Plus, unlike Sanders, Trump will not allow himself to be marginalized or pushed aside.

Most Americans realize that they missed the boat by not electing Ross Perot and have been waiting a long time for another loyal American to step up like that and now we a chance with someone even better.

If more Americans would have listened to Ross Perot back in 1992, we wouldn't be in this mess right now ‚Äì The American people and the real American economy would have been much better off today ‚Äì I and many other people, who were able to see through all of the left vs right BS, did vote for Perot, because he was straight forward and just used common sense ‚Äì He got involved because he cared about his country and the American people and didn't like the direction that our political leaders were going in ‚Äì Turns out that he was right.

If anyone really thought that evil-unethical-disingenuous-dishonest-power-monger-puppet Hillary Clinton was ever going to do anything to help the American People, the real American economy or the security of our country, they were sadly mistaken and delusional ‚Äì And Bernie Sanders lost whatever little credibility that he had by endorsing and supporting her. 

Let's face it ‚Äì If it were up to the corrupt manipulative media, both parties and their globalist masters, Hillary ""Madame Secretary"" Clinton would've long since have been anointed queen by now.

Establishment puppet politicians, corrupt manipulative media pundits and their globalist masters can put their BS in a box, gift wrap it and even put a bow on top, but fortunately most Americans can still smell what's inside.",0,2018-02-24 14:12:38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

Now, if you care about facts you can use your google machine to track the exact month by month figures that prove the fact that trump inherited a sound - and growing economy and that trend has continued because companies made record profits, the cost of credit was low and as more people were working that helped and is helping.  We won't really know the full impact of trump's policies on the economy until 1)  his budget is fully in place and there is enough time to evaluate the results and 2) the full impact of the tax cuts that gave billionaires and corporation billions on a permanent basis while throwing a bone to middle class families with tax cuts that will expire - while also adding $1.5 trillion that we will all have to play.",0,2018-02-24 15:10:58,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

"No Proof? 
Here are some of Trump's~assets and conflicts of interest:
1) Trump owes Blackstone/ Bayrock group $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won't reveal his tax returns)
2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.
3) Other companies that have borrowed from Blackstone have claimed that owing money to them is like owing to the Russian mob and while you owe them, they own you for many favors.
4) The Russian economy is badly faltering under the weight of its over-dependence on raw materials which as you know have plummeted in the last 2 years leaving the Russian economy scrambling to pay its debts.
5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)
6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39. With Iranian sanctions being lifted Russia will find another inexpensive competitor increasing production and pushing Russia further down the list of suppliers. 
As for Iranian sanctions, the 6 countries lifting them allowing Iran to collect on the billions it is owed for pumping oil but not being paid for it. These billions Iran can only get if the Iranian nuclear deal is signed. Trump spoke of ending the deals which would cause oil sales sanctions to be reimposed, which would make Russian oil more competitive.
7) Rex Tillerson (Trump's pick for Secretary of State) is the head of ExxonMobil, which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia, helping Putin put money in the Russian coffers to help reconstitute its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.
8) Putin cannot get access to these new cost saving technologies OR outside oil field development money, due to US sanctions on Russia, because of its involvement in Ukrainian civil war.
9) Look for Trump to end sanctions on Russia and to back out of the Iranian nuclear deal, to help Russia rebuild its economy, strengthen Putin and make Tillerson and Trump even richer, thus allowing Trump to satisfy his creditors at Blackstone.
10) With Trump's fabricated hatred of NATO and the U.N., the Russian military reconstituted, the threat to the Baltic states is real. Russia retaking their access to the Baltic Sea from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and threatening the shipping of millions of cubic feet of natural gas to lower Europe from Scandinavia, would allow Russia to make a good case for its oil and gas being piped into eastern Europe.",0,2018-02-24 13:39:12,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

"Do You Know Someone Suffering From Trump Unacceptance & Resistance Disorder (TURD)? 
Know the signs, spot the symptoms, and save a life!
TURD is a pattern of pathologically disasociative and psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, and increasing in severity with passing time.
Sufferers of TURD often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, sudden bouts of rage, rioting, and uncontrollable crying.
People with TURD are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to accept that Donald Trump is going to Make America Great Again.
TURD Is caused by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States of America. For many, both in America and worldwide, this was a shocking and unexpected outcome; their preferred news sources having failed to inform them that the alternative candidate was a criminal parasite in such ill health she got chucked into the back of a van like a kidnap victim.
Research is ongoing, but TURD appears to correlate closely with the following environmental and behavioral factors:
Membership in the Democratic Party
Identifying as a Feminist
Currently enrolled in college, and/or Possession of a Liberal Arts college degree
Living in a densely populated metropolitan area
Massive student debt
Spotty or non-existent work history
Patients with TURD are very resistant to treatment, and dangerous in large groups. Any possibility of treatment requires that they be separated from their hive-mind support apparatus; they cannot begin the process of accepting reality in the presence of encouragement towards delusion and irrationality. Separation may require the assistance of law enforcement.
If you have a friend or loved one suffering from TURD, urge them to seek treatment. Together we can beat this scourge, and Make America Great Again.",0,2018-02-24 12:54:12,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,
