Our finishing physically hurts my brain. How this game was not a drubbing I'll never know."
"I did not expect this. Such a brilliant performance from the team, especially from the defenders. Well deserved win. Now let's hope Sanchez and Özil stay. After this match, give Alexis all the money in the world, because we need him. He's the only world class player we have right now. The best since Henry."
FABREGAS🐍 TRULY DOES WEAR A MAGIC HAT. HE MADE HIMSELF INVISIBLE ALL GAME!

It's been 4 fucking hours and I'm still celebrating. YA GUNNERS YA!!
"Liverpool fan in peace here lads. Hell of a game, Arsenal could have won 5, 6, maybe 7 to 1. Wenger got it spot on today and holy fuck the players looked incredible. 

HOWEVER, does it not upset you that they've not played at this level all season? I'd be over the moon for the cup but furious because of the ""what could of been"", if you understand? How do you guys feel (apart from happy duh) about the team going forward? Cause this looks like a team that could win the league next season but we've said that for years. They were actually incredible today.

Congratulations!"
Hahahaha someone needs to make one of those Missing posters for Hazard because Holding and Mertesacker marked him out of Wembley.

"What a display. Tactics spot on, and EVERY SINGLE PLAYER put in a proper shift.

Wrighty said Wenger believes that team can win the title - that display shows what they're capable of when the passion and hunger is there.

I'm not embarrassed to say I cried with happiness at the celebrations. This year has been utter shite for me and that has brought me some much needed happiness.

Cheers for sharing it with me lads."

I LOVE ARSENAL!!!!
"It was funny. Arsene actually did a fantastic job today. I noticed after the half, Welbeck just didn't have his legs under him anymore. He was KILLING Chelsea in the first half pressuring the defense EVERY TIME they touched the ball, and I was screaming to take him off and put Giroud on. Arsene had enough once Chelsea scored. The team sat around after Chelsea was down to 10 men. They just sat back, and didn't pressure ANYONE with the ball. "
I FUCKING THIS CLUB ❤❤❤❤❤
"I never really gave us a chance and thought Chelsea would smash us - but somehow we did it. Just a brilliant day. Ospina and Per were immense, and Ramsey stepped up too.

And Alexis, you're a beautiful, beautiful man."
What a wonderful fucking match. Great performance by the gunners
Ramsey!
Ay 
It's a pity Arsene can't get them to play that well the rest of the time.

Spurs fan here. So happy Arsenal won! The team deserved a win.  
Where are all the Wenger out dick heads now?
"Can you imagine a back four of koscielny, mertesacker, bellerin and mustafi all healthy next season???

The team REALLY missed that big, strong, vocal leader at the back this season that Mertesacker brings. It was evident today."
So what happened to Wenger out? 
"Yeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhh. 7 cups. So much hate all year. Fell short of our expectations but a sense of perspective is a wonderful thing. Cup, champions league, 5th place is a good year. "

Hello! Top of the front page!
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW OLI COULD CROSS
"Gunners are red
Chelsea is blue
Moses tripped on nothing
Fucken looked like Camp Nou"
"Fair play to AT, some bullshit in the first half, but that red card makes up for all of it"
Feels so good to have a Chelsea player sent off! Would have been even better if it was Costa!
"Best thing was that Ox seemed to see it coming so was ""nope!"" and stopped suddenly so Taylor saw Moses was diving like a prick."
Even apart from his sending off he was awful today
"Moses was asking YHWH to part the *RED SEA,* and just like all deities he did fuck all"
WHat do we think of tottenham!!
Bahahahahaha
You forgot unbeaten in a full season.
Chelsea: London's first 
"Best season for Tottenham in years, and no hardware to show for it!"
He was hobbling about nd jumping up and down lol
Love his enthusiasm.  Dude was on one leg and even Monreal was poking fun at him for it.  
I was just giggling seeing him limping to celebrate with the others.
He has all summer to recover
"I went to England/The Emirates for the first time this year and bought the red home shirt. I've worn it exactly three times:

3-0 West Ham

2-1 Man City

I see you were also playing the Arsenal drinking game.
"what a great birthday gift, happy birthday, ENJOY!!!"
you a word
Bellerin and Holding were quick to hug and lift Ramsey and celebrate with him. Some others joined in soon too. Could be because the game was still tight at 2-1 and there were still 10 minutes to play. Heads had to be in the game.

YOU KNOW!
My dog even hates Tottenham. 
Liverpool beating City might be our biggest accomplishment this year.
Crazy to think we haven't won the league since winning it without a single loss in a season.
"Thank fuck, Liverpool had me shitting myself at 4-3 lol"
Ox watta gooner
Happy invincibles day lads
This is quality. The only thing making my weekend. 
At least Wenger can leave with that record unbroken. He needs something to retire on.
Thank god I really thought City were gonna do it... Wouldn't be surprised if that's their only Prem loss this season
"Look at that quality, that's the type of quality you get excited for, the side we played today, I felt like I was only watching out of obligation. Fuck me :'("
I'd be ok with this being our all time top post tbh
Almost feel sorry for anyone that wasn't around to witness us at our best under Wenger.
Regardless of how terrible we are now. This will forever be in the memory and will unlikely be repeated.
I’ll allow it
"Meanwhile in 2018, an 8 point gap has opened between Arsenal and 4th place."
The only way we are still relevant today ..
Make Arsenal Great Again.
Ox post match one NBCSports may be the biggest indictment of Wenger to date. Ox basically saying he left because he was tired of being played out of position and when asked why his form looks so good “because if not I know this manager will want a word with me. He doesn’t accept poor performances”. That last sentence says it all. Ox openly saying he wasn’t pushed at Arsenal and he wanted to make himself uncomfortable. Good for him and shame on Arsenal for allowing Wenger to fester. 
Ayyy. They can all fuck off mow with their “greatest ever team in the PL era” bullshit. 
"Does this make the Ox transfer one of those ""good for both sides"" deals then? I think it does.

Congrats on keeping hold of the ""Invincibles"" title, gooners. Preston had it for a century and a quarter; Henry, Bergkamp, Viera and co. deserve to hold it for more than 14. "
I think Preston North End were also invincibles but that was over a hundred years ago.
"Today, us LFC fans and you gunners party like friends"
please take me back
Shows what an unbelievable achievement that season was.
The last time we were great.
Today's only silver lining I'm afraid
How far we've tumbled.
Living in the past. That's what we're reduced to.
I dunno if I want to see this man. It's even more depressing having to compare this lot to what we have now :(
I'll tell ya that was great fucking game... Got scared MC was gonna pull it back
"Nah mate, [pretty sure Don Bradman lead the only invincibles who really matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_England_in_1948)!"
"Was worried for a while. When Palace's Luka Milivojevic missed an easy penalty  a couple weeks back I feared it was going to be City's [van Nistelrooy moment] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPkU3ers148). But I shouldn't have. Pool did it in the most Pool way possible.

So the Invincibles stand for at least another year. "
Even Pep said it wouldn't happen.

If we could sign a player with the quality of this shitpost we may actually be title contenders.
This Invincible team is full of captains even without them wearing the armband. Winners. Leaders. Legends
Were people actually worried?  It's barely halfway through January yet
How did we go from Vieira to Xhaka?

You're welcome
What have we become?
When you can play like shit in mid january and beat the undefeated team that is the state of english football
If Aguero would have scored that at the end I literally think they would have finished this season invincibles.

As a Liverpool supporter we never unclench.
Knuckles went white at that side netting!!
LFC fan here - welcome to every week of my life.
Can I ask why you'd want Liverpool to win over city even though you're closer to Liverpool than city?
"I'm an arsenal fan and wanted Man city to score so badly at the end, wtf is wrong with me."
"Some performance from the ox though eh? In his favoured right midfielder position, strength, vision, determination, finishing... first class and the kind of play Wenger never got out of him unfortunately."
"Klopp knows how to use speedy attackers quite well. Wenger used to know how to do it, not sure wtf happened."
Thanks for ox boys. 
Just to leach off a top comment but would you guys prefer to have never finished undefeated but win the 2006 cl final or history as we know it 
"That, and most FA cups of any manager in history "
Pep will try again next year. 
"Perhaps. Their defense is vulnerable though. I think that's why Pep rubbished the idea they would go undefeated. Knew they could have a game or two where they gave up lots of goals and just couldn't make up the difference. Stones is still developing and liable to making a mistake or two each game. Otamendi has improved under Pep but isn't top top class. Kompany is always injured. At left wingback they play Delph. I could see Spurs taking a game from them, especially if Alderweireld is fit. They can press and counter like Liverpool did today. "
"Pep has a habit of not taking the league seriously if he's far enough ahead or already won, and still in other competitions. A lot of his dropped points at Bayern came after he'd mathematically won the league."
"Why would we care who won that game? City is too far ahead anyways so them winning doesn't make a difference for us. 
(new to this so bear with me <3) "
"Most of us Americans are in that boat. PL has only become broadly popular (and easier to watch in the US) in the past 5 years or so. Plus we didn't inherit supporting a club; we had to choose one. So we missed the glory days.
"
Almost? I genuinely do. What a time it was.
"Ai. The first thing I really remember about Arsenal was losing the CL final. Then I started getting really invested in our 2007/2008 campaign.

Fuck me."
"I miss those days when I could watch football at the weekends in the TV with dad. We were both excited to see playing Arsenal.

Nowadays I'm searching for a shitty stream, with shitty commentators just praising to finally play some nice football.."
"I'm legit angry, as a relatively new american fan, that there isn't much of those games on youtube rn.  80%of old arsenal games I can find are uploaded by some United fan."
There would have been a witch hunt if you didn't.
This is as rare as a City loss these days.
there are other invicibles though
And make spurs pay for it.
"That's a straight up lie ... i've watched this interview twice to make sure, he didn't say that once, not even close. Unless you're referring to another interview ? On NBC he had nothing but good words for Arsenal."
"Well, you can still argue it (even if I don't actually agree) on the basis that the opposition is much stronger now."
They'll win so many more than we did that season though. 12 draws is a lot. 
I think we'll have to listen to arguments about whether or not they are the greatest until next season starts.
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/OwNxUNZ
We were great in the CL final.
It’s kinda sad to see we’ve become such a shit club that we resort to other teams short comings to make us happy despite them not having any thing to do with our current season
There’s a difference between living in the past and preserving accomplishments. You can be proud that your club is still the only club to accomplish something without living in the past. I think reading r/Gunner makes it very clear that gooners are well aware of the current state of affairs.
Yeah - all the things wed make fun of Liverpool for 5 years ago
"I apologize in advance for not being a Arsenal fan, but I wouldn't worry about that, you should be proud of those records.

Other clubs are laughing at us
"We've got a lot of first team guys out injured. I also feel like Wenger lets Ozil stay home when we play teams like this, never a good idea."
"**Australian cricket team in England in 1948**

The Australian cricket team in England in 1948 was captained by Don Bradman, who was making his fourth and final tour of England. The team is famous for being the first Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing a match. This feat earned them the nickname of The Invincibles, and they are regarded as one of the greatest cricket teams of all time. According to the Australian federal government the team ""is one of Australia's most cherished sporting legends"".

"**The Invincibles (football)**

In English football, ""The Invincibles"" has been used to refer to the Arsenal team of the 2003–04 season managed by Arsène Wenger, and the Preston North End team of the 1880s managed by William Sudell. Preston earned the nickname after completing an entire season undefeated in league and cup competition, while Arsenal were undefeated in the league.

The term ""Invincibles"" has also been used elsewhere in European football. Aside from Preston North End and Arsenal, only Italian clubs Milan and Juventus have gone a league season without defeat among the ""Big Five"" European leagues, in 1991–92 and 2011–12 Serie A respectively.

Tbf his play is much better suited to the 433 midfield role than our 4231 or 5221 where the central mids have much less freedom. Although we absolutely had the personnel to switch to a 433 at the time
We did get that play out of him.  He was very good vs Bayern in the CL

UCL silverware is won every season. Invincibility is golden.

"Yeah, but the invincible record is pretty damn special."
Pep rubbished the idea because even he doesn't have the balls to call it before the season's even started like early 00's wonga.
I think it wasn't too likely partly because they shot off to such a big lead that psychologically they were bound to get complacent.
I like how you didn’t have to say anything other than Delph

The quote was exactly what I quoted and by saying that “this manager would want a word with me. He doesn’t accept poor performance”. Don’t tell me what I say is a lie. It’s exactly the quote and his words weren’t directly negative towards Arsenal but he absolutely said he was played as an RW which he did not like “I want to be attacking with the boys” and he also made the comment about poor form wasn’t accepted by Klopp. If you can’t draw conclusions based on those comments that’s on you. 
"http://www.nbcsports.com/video/liverpools-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-happy-new-club

“If I don’t the manager would want a word with me. He doesn’t accept half-hearted ness” when asked about his form and putting a boot in. Now if the question is asked why he looks happy and in form now and that his response then the conclusion is easily made that it was accepted when he was in previous poor form. 

He also said he needed a change to push himself which implies that his manager at Arsenal wasn’t pushing him. Explain where I’ve “lied”. "
but they have unlimited funds though.
"we were great for 33 games in 2007-08

A team hoping to get into the top four needs and is expected to have depth.

Even if you compare our full squad without injuries, its easily the worse team we have on paper since the invincibles IMO."
Yeah had that thought myself but there's too much quality in the PL right now it's a big ask I think.
"It's surreal, feels like there were a bunch of possible timelines coming out of 2006 and this has to be one of the shittier ones

"Was 5 when it happened, celebrated it with my gran (also an Arsenal fan). Didn’t understand the privilege I was given back then. 
Now that I actively follow the team we’re complete shit. Cheers for getting me in this, gran"
"Okay okay, my bad if he really said that. I must have watched a shorter version of the interview. The link you give me doesn't work in my location though, and I can't find a longer version, but I'll believe you on that quote. 

So this quote is damning for Arsene Wenger, but just a little detail though, I've heard Chambo use plenty of times this ""comfort zone"" expression regarding his move, and I just think this expression is not as strong as the fans think when listening to him. ""Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone"" has become commonly used in all domains, not particularly difficult domains, and sometimes it means you just want something different. And yes, that also means pushing yourself, but not necessarily in the sense that you didn't push yourself before, more in the sense that you became too good at pushing yourself in your comfort zone, and you want to keep pushing yourself, but in a zone you don't know, which is generally harder. Even when your manager is softer than your previous one it's still harder. it's common that someone being already very hard-working and successful chooses to push himself out of his comfort zone, it's not only for lazy people. I'd even argue it's something that hard-working people do more. Just a little detail I wanna add to defend my man Wenger, because the times are rough for him.

 Regarding the fact he said he didn't want to play as an RWB, I don't take it badly. At the contrary, I would be even more concerned about the state of the club if position wasn't such a big issue and he left because of other things. That position thing reassures me a little."
"But their opponents aren't poor either anymore.

Look at it this way, what if they win the league with the one defeat, but also win the Champions league and a cup? 

You've got wait until the season ends to really judge, but so far they're doing pretty well."
that midfield partnership of cazorla and coq looked elite.
you're thinking of the 08-09 CL
08-09 season was the Ronaldo goal
"To be fair, 07/08 was the only season since the invincibles where Arsenal were actually genuinely close to winning the title.

And who could forget the 2-0 win over AC Milan. Still remember watching that on TV, one of the first games I remember watching"
"Of course you're right, pinpoints why we have to start buying good players and bring in a new manager."
"We went on to go 49 games total unbeaten, the domestic record...

Checkmate 😁"
it matters a lot because it means teams were significantly more content with a draw back then
I can't believe I'd ever miss those days
"Pathetic, what is? Hoping that Man City or any other club don't deal another blow to the club? Wishing insult to injury on your club, however, is pretty pathetic."
Sounds like you're jealous
That's actually bloody good

What I love about this goal. He starts off with an exquisite little back heel and then turns into Dave from your pub team. Gets on his bike arms pumping powering down the field. Will he make it? Dave wouldn't but Giroud? Pretty sure that ball was behind him because Lex was surprised.
Oh my Giroud 
Just take me to the promise land Jiru baby 
That idiot who called him the French Rondon should commit seppuku as atonement for their ignorance.

Absolutely barbaric
That goal was ridiculously sublime. And sublimely ridiculous. Fucking beautiful.
Taken down  :(
This was an amazing goal. I don't understand how he goes from missing a sitter to scoring this. Unreal stuff.
"For the rest of the year I might comment on every nice goal with ""pretty good, but it's not a Giroud"""
He was struggling to keep up--leading to the best goal of his career. There has to be a lesson from this.
Why the fuck are there only 82% upvotes for this?
"This post is now the top post of all time on r/gunners, and another replay of the vid is second top of all time on r/soccer. Goat-cheese!"

Did he do a backheel pass in the lead up too? Oh my lawd
I mean seriously....can it be beat?
you know he wanted to run over and celebrate with the guys 
I noticed how that one conveniently got by him.  Haha. Legend.
Once you Gooner you can't go back. 
That whole sequence of play is why they call it the beautiful game!
Then him sprinting like hell to get there!!!
"On the American NBC halftime program, the American commentator said ""if that was a yoga pose it'd be called the scoring Frenchman."" Normally I find that guy to be boring as hell but he got in a good one today. "
The here we need. 
The offside one 
he was offsides anyway! and the flick to get this started and he turned the burners on to get back into the play!
So far
All time  or  2017. 
"TRUE!! Starts with his interception and then watch him run all the way, I almost think Alexis was trying to get the ball to Lucas, until the stupid sexy Frenchman got in the way."
"I think this is my favorite reaction so far. Way more eloquent than mine, which was something along the lines of the sound a ten year old girl makes when presented with a puppy."
Still true

"weird, I can't seem to feel upset anymore. is this normal?"
"Cliche but defence starts from upfront.  Needs organization and humility.  Martin Keown's saying Bellerin is left exposed and nobody's helping him out.

You see David Silva running back to make blocks and Kevin de Brunye pressing as if his life depended on it.  These are world class players doing the dirty work.

Arsenal players are in a coddled bubble."
Throwback to when Mustafi said he knew what the problems were
"How though? Kosc was boss just a little while back. Bellerin was the brightest future RB there was. Kola was in BL TOTS. Mustafi was never world class, but was actually more than average at Valencia, Conf cup. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS TEAM???"
The least we can do is farm karma in these depressing times. Bless you all
"Not only shit at defending... Watch how city works it out from the back and compare that to us, what a difference..."
"That third goal, holy shit.  Do we even come out of the tunnel for the second half?"
Koscielny somehow went from arguably the best centre back in the league to a player who cannot play the simplest of passes.

"Hey shut up guys, THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID WRONG, they won't listen to outside opinions."
Just need 3 centerbacks a dm and a goal keeper this summer! No worries.
"I had to run an errand for 5 minutes. When I came back in I asked ""What do you think are the odds that Man City have scored again?""

They had scored twice. "
"I was at the game tonight. I thought I'd share a brief analysis.

1) City are really really really good. That is not a facetious comment, but just something that a manger should acknowledge before playing them. They are extremely well tactically drilled, they make it uncomfortable to have the ball even in your own half, they compress, exploit and create space excellently and consistently, their players are better than yours when it comes to speed and quality. This should be the basis of any setup against City. This is partly a sad truth because Pep is a superior manager, and partly a reality because the club has all the moneyz.

2) Arsenal set up and played as if City were not considerably better than them. We tried to play it out from the back, we attacked in large numbers leaving our defence exposed, we ""played football"" against them (instead of parking the bus and countering). 

3) Attempting to ""play football"" when you are a worse team is the biggest mistake that you can make. I think it was two seasons ago where we started off the season with a new strategy for ""big games"", we had two compressed back lines, stayed tight and made it hard for teams to play through us - then did all we could to counter attack. If I remember correctly it served us well, made us hard to play against and led to respectable results. For some reason by the end of that season we had stopped following this game plan, and we certainly did not think to follow it tonight. I used to play poker quite seriously, and the worst thing a bad player can do against you is try to play fancy poker. That is when they are their most exploitable. It's hard for a player to go too wrong if they respect the fact you understand the game better than them, tighten up the range of hands they play, sit back and play cautiously against you. We took the former approach tonight against City and it showed.

In conclusion, this was a strategic error stemming from a lack of understanding, or acceptance, of our own weaknesses (some of them, such as the financial differences, quite understandable and nothing to be ashamed of). Wenger is responsible for that unfortunately. "
This on r/All yet?
"The day I get a lambo, wenger has retired. And that wont happen :)"
I should try out for CB 
This team reminds me of Chelsea when Mourinho lost the team and then they fired him. Except the fired him part.
I love Wenger but I am 100% done. Can't bring myself to watch any more games till he is gone. 
it's a good thing we've spent all this money on attackers.
At least this puts more pressure on wenger to be forced out. Keep the goals coming lads.
"Call me naive, but I actually think Wenger is inching towards being in real danger of being sacked.

 I welcome it, this season is a lost cause. Still though, embarrassing for those who pay for this shite.

"
Our everything is shit. It's the players in part. But also the manager for running us in setups that don't take advantage of the skill sets we have.
We've played Man City three times this season. The collective scoreline from those  games is 9-1. 
Cech is the last of a dying breed of goalkeepers who can't use their feet. 
Wenger is gone after this game. He has to fucking resign.
Manager is shite.
"I, for one, welcome our new Man City overlords"
What more needs to happen for this man to leave? The players and fans are just waiting for him to leave. Plz let us move forward Arsene
Where are the #WengerIns? Show yourselves!
"I'm tired, Robbie. "
coming from r/all i thought this was a political post about guns and self defense
"Fuck it, just start Mertesacker. At least he can bring leadership."
The only jersey I'm proud to wear from this season is my Giroud away.
I think Arsenal should do the right thing and provide a lifetime supply of tissues for that crying kid. He is definitely going to need it.
"I don't want Karma, I want a team that I can be proud of occasionally."
We're fucking shit we're fucking shit we're fucking shiiiiiiiittttt
Wenger should resign tonight.
"City are just fantastic. They cut through us like butter, it's ridiculous. "
OH NO! WE SUCK AGAIN!! :)
I have no sympathy for our manager whatsoever
Acceptance -> Resignation -> This too shall pass
"I thought it was crazy when the camera cuts to the managers. Pep is up all game, even after 3-0, giving instructions to his team. Then it cuts to Wenger, who is just sitting there, hoping. He's not even talking to Bould, it planning subs, or making tactical changes. Just watching. Pep was incredible to watch tonight. 

I want a manager who sets us up, but can be flexible and organized tactically. Is that so much to ask for? "
"Koscielny is done. Bellerin is a crap defender, but we knew that already. Cech is arguably the worst keeper of any upper half table teams. None of this matters in the first place because Wenger is an awful manager. "
Ramsey is the only player who has turned up
We have the worst manager in the league 
I WANT MY FAT AND LAZY ARSHAVIN BACK. AT LEAST HE DID PRETTY THINGS GOING FORWARD :(
I was once read that Monreal and Kosc were world class centrehalfs in our subreddit. K. 
Can we get di matteo as intern manager to help us win the europa? 
just what is happening? i feel hurt and sad
"I'm sad, boys :("
Kos is done. He is the one who is shite. 
How does he not go from this humiliation
"You guys realize Pep probably told the team to just kill the game and just see it out? They took it down a few levels from the first half. Its scary and sad at the same time, to think we dont score on our chances and make them actually work for the win. They just put in a shift for 45min and its in the bag. Shameful. #WengerOut"
Can we all agree wenger is done and should leave today??? No matter what happens until the end of the season he should go now
I can't even cry anymore. I'm out of tears.
"Hey guys Wenger is fine there are no problems here. We just keep getting our arses beat by the table toppers and middlers and then do the same to sides that have no business being in the Premiership, all is well."
"Wenger isn’t going anywhere, Kroenke isn’t going anywhere, get used to this. No matter how much quality this team has, or gains, there is no leadership or drive. Arsenal is sitting here gloating about FA Cups while the big teams compete for the Champions League and league title. 

There will be some big signings in the summer, some hope, then the typical Arsenal slow down with the odd FA Cup. 


Stagnant. "
This squad certainly knows how to put the Arse in Arsenal. 
"Oh well, just another L. Bring on next season lol"
I got made fun of by a foreign kid on campus for wearing an Arsenal jacket and there was nothing I could say. It’s the worst. Rip Arsenal. 
"I mean, we didn’t score any goals either..."
It's not just our defence. Our midfield is mid table at best with a few exceptions like Ozil and Wilshere on his day. There's no fight in the middle of the pitch and no service going to our strikers when they need it.
I grew up in the past few months. What i meant to say is i dont let arsenal dictate my happiness anymore.
My Nonna passed away and we had the visitation today. Quite glad I missed this and did not follow. We're a fucking embarrassment. 
I was going to watch the game but I got caught in storm Emma walking home. Something tells me that may have been marginally the more pleasant of the two experiences. 
"You should have a ""our manager is shit upvote party"""
What is even happening anymore. We have become a joke. 
I used to be sad when we lost. Now it's just usual
The entire team is lads. Another 0/10 from ozil who I'm told is world class. Why lie
" Our midfielders are lazy in defense duties..
Hope a new manager will whip them to work"
"I can’t enjoy our games anymore. It’s gotten so bad that I don’t even watch them anymore. The results have gotten too predictable and I can’t help but wonder if it’s due to the players, the opposition, the tactics or mentality. Most likely, it’s a combination of all. Our players are quite good, but overrated by Wenger. The potential is there, but the mix of skillset is poor. No true wingers that can dribble, not enough players who want to defend (they all want to attack), not enough players that can retain the ball in the opposition’s half, and not enough player that can provide a killer pass. The opposition also have improved. The rise of Liverpool (post-Suarez) and Spurs (post-Bale) have been a surprise. They have done fantastic transfer business and tactically have gotten much stronger, but we also seem to have problems with the lower positioned teams. We are not convincing when we win and when we lose, we lose badly. Games that we do win are end-to-end, scraps or we just play the ball aimlessly to each other and hope for individual brilliant moments. Tactically we need to improve a lot: our buildup play is poor, player movement is non-existent, we linger on the ball (especially in midfield), our attacking patterns are predictable, cannot recognize the defensive danger zones, have poor zonal marking, and so on. 

Mentally, all faith in Wenger seems to be gone. Faith by fans, pundits AND our players. Our players are just going through the motions. They put in effort, want to win, hope to win, they love Wenger, the fans and our club, but they know that there is a high chance that we won’t win the premier league or champions league. Every loss seems to add to our negative mentality. Even new players are (in time) also affected. Players are giving 90%, as they can’t commit to our tactics and are not convinced that we can win against quality opposition.

I still love the club, the players and Wenger. Though I don’t understand our transfers policy at times. I think we have a quality group of players. Much better than post-Van Persie. You have to applaud our opposition for improving, but new and better tactics would improve us greatly. Mentally, we all need to stand behind our manager and his tactics, even if the situation is frustrating. We all want changes, but we need a top manager or else we fall behind. Wenger is still a legend and on occasion, has his tactics spot on. His star is fading and whether he still got it, I honestly don’t know.  Nothing lasts, though I hoped he would go out on a high winning the champions league, putting an everlasting star on our badge. It would be symbol for all that he has done. The greatest ever manager for Arsenal...."
"I got made fun of by a foreign kid on campus for wearing an Arsenal jacket and there was nothing I could say. It’s the worst. Rip Arsenal.

"More like our club is shit upvote party. Fuck the defense, everything around the club has become toxic from the board to the players to the managers to the fans. The only thing stopping me from giving up on this club is I've already been a fan for so long it wouldn't make sense and I wouldn't enjoy other football as much. At the moment we are a legitimate joke a of a club, a laughingstock to the fans of other teams, and even to other team themselves as seen by Deeney's comments."
"I've felt genuine apathy for Arsenal for a while now...probably since we botched our title run-in to Leicester of all teams.  But yesterday I felt true sadness for Wenger, the same kind of sadness you feel when watching a cute animal on National Geographic about to get mauled by a fearsome predator.

Wenger is so out of his depth right now, but he desperately believes he can turn things around. The Arsenal board need to man the **** up and put him out of his misery, before he actually finds a way to totally ruin his legacy."
Thats a little harsh.City played really well in this first half.
"Defence ain't shit. It's the way we play so high on the line when we are on the attack. So easy for the opposition to launch a counter attack from dangerous positions while half of our team sits way ahead of the half line to play wengerball. 

Can't stress that enough, look at how many players man city brought forward for david silva's goal.

Then look at how many player we had when sergio aguero made that turn and made that run which resulted in the third goal.
We have good defensive players, it's just the way goals pile up against us from counter attacks (most of the time)."
Hey Bellerin said it man. The fans can t say shit about our defending. Only the coaches ! And Wenger says all is good. So all is good. We know fuck all guys. Mustafi is amazing. Wenger said there is no better players out there that can improve us. 
OUR MANAGER IS SHIT UPVOTE PARTY
Koscielny needs to go
"Stop! Stop!

They're already dead"
Thank God MLS starts this weekend. I can actually be excited about Atlanta United. 
If we brought in Tony Pulis as the manager we wouldn't have to deal with this shit
Hey... We cleared it a couple times... 
"Its a very embarrasing first half. I understand the frustrations but do not put everything on the defense. They are guilty atleast for letting Sanè getting past them that easily, but the midfield is not tracking back fast enough. Ozil and xhaka are halfheartedly sprinting, in hope of us winning the ball and launching and attack. Our defenders are shite but as a team, the midfield cant lose the battle that easily. 

They are letting the defense down big time and its pissing me the fuck off. Ozils body language is back where he looks disinterested and pissed off but his language does not match his actions. He needs to track back more. if KdB can track, and Silva can track. Then Ozil better fucking track or get subbed out(Yes i said it.)"
so confused as where bellerin was running to in that 3rd goal. i mean seriously he seemed to be running away from the goal
"Kolasinac is good but only up front. Need to learn better positioning, too easy for the ManC to play around him. Same goes with Bellerin. I have no clue what instruction he has. As soon as Sane gets the balls he goes to the centre. He is the only guy who can match his pace, why run away from him? Lost hope in watching us play. "

What defence?
"0-3 to City after 30 minutes tonight

the fans deserve some change, it's our plight!

wenger in or wenger out

we can all agree to shout:

OUR DEFENCE IS SHIT, AINT THAT RIGHT?"
"Bit harsh on shit tbh, shit has its uses "
What's a defence?
This team makes me want to die
This performance is shit. 
"Eh, it was a little bit cold. They warmed up better than we did"
"A lot of the goals we conceded are with the opposing attackers somehow running at the defenders as this massive gap opens up. At that point, we're always on the back foot and are then having to 'recover'. If you've got a higher class of players with better defenders that could maybe do a better job of stepping up also, it could work.

Once players are having to recover with players attacking full force at them, your average team will get a few chances, but an efficient team will just take the chance. The opposing attackers cannot be given such space, when it's obvious that our fullbacks bomb up, we're gonna be exposed. Maybe the players just don't read the game well in this setup? Who knows."
lmao if you think it's just the defense that is shit. The midfield is actually worse and the the front 3 have 0 impact. 
"Not much you can do about goals of that quality.

If we scored them you wouldn't comment on the defending."
I’ve become so numb. 
FUCK THIS CLUB
Brb I’m gonna kill myself real quick 
"I’ve been religiously defending Xhaka until an Hour n’ a half ago, he left me no choice but to board the hate train.

Ive been sitting in a corner with arms around my knees, saying ‘GOONER FOR LIFE’, ever since the game ended.

I’m depressed as f**k right now."
Just fuck it.
kill me.
"Man I think it's our offense that needs help... hear me out. We show no desire going forward and we really don't look threatening when we do. It seems that we do nothing to put the other team on their heels. When our offense struggles, our defense struggles. The other team has every reason to push forward and take chances because we can't punish them for their mistakes. They put so much pressure on our defenders that they are bound to break, no matter how good they are at defending. This team lacks heart and desire and I am going to sound like a broken record saying this, but it seems from our management. Not only Wenger, but he is a good place to start. He should be firing this team up to win and psyching them up to play competitive games. Instead it looks like we just walk through the motions. We have good players and we have some excellent defenders... we just lack team spirit. "
We are shit
I mean I don't disagree but the quality of those man city goals was kind of silly.
"I’m just lucky I have my local team to support in this time of depression. To all of you whose local team is Arsenal, I’m sorry.

I’m so sorry."
Terrible 
"Low expectation = Low disappointment
Once you get used of Arsenal losing like me, you will be fine :)
I wish Wenger aware of the situation and resign himself. Not that he is a bad coach (maybe he is, for now), but seems like the players are not happy or having the weak mindset that winning nothing is actually ok under Wenger's management. For me he just like some old guys in a workplace who has their own pride and not willing to listen to the others. Anyway our first team players are mediocre at best and our depth is shit."
Wenger is shit upvote party! Lolol
"How is our defence so shit? And why did we just spend 56million on a striker when someone like Laporte was available. Mustafi, Xhaka all turned to shit on defence, Kos and Monreal are getting old, unless we’re planning to play Chambers and Holding next year we need new defenders and a new midfield probably. 

Wenger has clearly lost it. Looking at the old premier league records and you’d never tell that this same manager had gone unbeaten in 04, unbeaten away in 01’ and 04’, unbeaten at home in 99’, 04’ and 08’, scoring in every game in 02’ and go unbeaten 49 games. Our attack and defence is shit. Sure maybe we’ll get a good win next week or the week after that’ll cheer us all up, but bottom line is, Wenger needs to go. (Are there even still people on the Wenger knows best train?)"
Who signed us up for this club ffs
"Mustafi is the biggest fraud I’ve ever seen, he cannot defend whatsoever, he is supposed to be a ball playing defender but I’ve never actually seen him start an attack or even make a good pass.
Bellerin has always been overrated after having a few good games for us, I have no idea why Debuchy was never given a chance. 
I wouldn’t mind our defence being this bad as much if we were enjoyable to watch and scored goals.
De Ligt maybe young but if we picked him up in the summer and start him he’d be World Class in a matter of years, I wouldn’t even care if he made a few mistakes whilst developing as these next few years are gunna be shite for us anyway, John stones was getting criticised week in week out last year and he’s been one of the best defenders in the prem this season."
Kroenke is like a cloud of diarrhea hanging over the club. Not excusing Wenger but just saying 
Has he been sacked yet? Is it safe to go outside? 
Those FA Cup wins have done more to hurt us than not
It doesn't even hurt anymore... I've been conditioned. 
Comfortably numb.:-D
"We desperately need a new GK, CB, and DM.

Cech and Ospina are way past their expiry date. 

Kos is permanently injured, Per is off to oversee the academy, Holding Chambers is not ready. Monreal shouldn't play LCB. 

Elneny isn't good enough, Xhaka is not disciplined and not defensive minded enough, Coq is gone.

Pay whatever it cost for Lafont, loan him back to Toulouse. Buy Trapp. Get rid of Ospina. Cech can be demoted to Cup GK.

Loan out holding, sell Chambers, buy a new star CB.

Sell Elneny, buy a proper CDM

and play a 442 Diamond "
Mustafi is a fucking embarrassment. Xhaka is a ghost. That is all.
I wish I could upvote more than once *sigh*
Everything about the team is shit atm
Using these dark times to whore karma. Classy.
we're fucking shit. we're fucking shit. we're fucking shit! we're fucking shit! we're fucking shit...
ya this season is a gunner
Everything is shit. Has to be sacked before the season but won't happen.

"Whoops, forgot Xhaka. Can't forget Xhaka. Absolute shit player in every single aspect of his responsibilities. "
"Anyone else have issue with the support on match-days? I know today isnt normal, but the crowds are always shit. I feel like the Arsenal has become a day out for families rather than real supporters turning up and making up the 12th man."

At least my match days will be free for the rest of the season.

can't even give a fuck anymore
Fuck Bellerin and his hair
Just the defence?
someone quick make a our midfield is shit upvote party as well
Yeah cuz our offense is doing great
Of course we fucked the penn... 
only 1 game left against a top 4 side
"I thought playing 4 at the back would help... Doesn't help if they don't turn up.
Outclassed and unmotivated "
What are emotions? Forgot what it means to have them.
This is absolutely ridiculous. Any other club's manager would have been sacked weeks ago if not years ago. 
LETS TANK FOR DAHLIN
I’m more upset at people talking about the lack of fans in the stands tbh
A lot of it has to do with our defensive pressure from the midfield forward.  Only Welbeck has put in the defensive effort consistently.  With some sporadic contribution from Ramsey and Auba.
I reckon I may be better than mustafi.
"Just look how quickly our players react to City coming forward for Sane's goal. They're all jogging while City surge forward en masse, nobody broke their back to help out the defence."
yeah it is.
"Not even angry or frustrated i have just given up with this club

"I’m going with my friend to what will be my first trip to the Emirates this May. Although every loss hurts worse and worse than the one before, nothing can hinder my excitement. I may even shed a tear when I sit in my seat for my first premier league game. 

Arsenal may be shit right now but this club means a lot to me and I just thought you guys should be reminded that as much as they lose...we all still deeply love this club and when we finally return to winning ways it will feel even more special. "
"On the other hand, our attack is crap as well"
"The way to change it is to think of spending on defense as sexy. Oh so sexy. Don't care about strikers. No, give me a sexy central defender. Think it, channel it, be it. Then when they toss a spending pittance to the fans we might get the defense we need. Not just another boring striker, a super sexy central defender. "
I just bombed my comp sci midterm. It seems that my failures always coincide with Arsenal’s 
Wuh-wuh-wuh-why don't you just play foosball like all the other boys ??
Steve Bould must have naked pictures of Wegner. I have no idea how he still has a job with how abysmal the defence has been.
"I realize you probably are including this in the statement, but your midfield is shit, especially when it comes to defending.  Xhaka is a joke of a defensive midfielder.  Ramsey and Wilshere are quality players, but they are more box to box or attacking midfielders than defensive ones.  I still can't believe Arsenal decided to buy Aubameyang when they clearly needed a quality defensive midfielder and probably a CB.  

And how does Xhaka continue to start games?  Hell, Elneny is better defensively than him."
Central Defensive Mid
This thread has made it to r/all 
"Do you know what a proper manager does coming off the back of an embarrassing 3-0 loss, to play the same deadly team full of confidence and attacking prowess....

Set the fucking team up for a 0-0 draw at all costs. Have the team disciplined fighting for their clean sheet lives. 

Alas, Mr Wenger tells the team to go out and play football. "
"Our defense no longer plays until the whistle, a through ball gets passed them and they all stop looking for an offside instead of chasing it down until they hear the whistle, on the offensive side of thugs they seem to no longer be able to get the pass and go play style running, they lose the ball in the midfield and play chase all game"
"Not shit, what we need is a leader in there who organises them, gets them working as a complete unit & takes responsibility.

A quality DM who can give them protection would help.

Bar that 3rd goal I actually think they’ve been okay. City have just been incredible so far. Kola needs a lot of help though.
Give it Arteta til the end of the season.
You can't call defence shit if you don't have defence.
"A team with no leaders. It has been like this for over 10 years now. A loser mentality every single season since we moved from Highbury. This is starting to become the normal Arsenal. Nowadays we are surprised if we actually win a game.

Please, let Milan end us with 5-0 so Wenger decides to move one year early. And then with a new manager slowly try to build something, starting with the defense. Cech, Bellerin, Koscielny, Mustafi, Xhaka etc. They all need to leave. "
At least the first 15 minutes were interesting
It's so clear he's lost the dressing room
so is wenger at this point. no ideas left.
Yikes

Let's get this to the top of r/all
5k upvotes for a stupid shit thread. The state of this subreddit is way worse than how the club is doing. I sometimes feel like 80% of the people here weren't even born when Wenger took over Arsenal.

"Welcome to acceptance. The last of the 5 stages.

comfortably numb
"For me, every loss carries the positive of it being more evidence in the wenger out case. That positive balances the negative of losing; hence the neutrality/numbness about it all"
Yes
Early in the 2016/2017 season while watching Conte’s Chelsea I noticed their players like Hazard doing exactly this in August and they won the league. You win as a team and you lose as a team.
"We just press up high, waste all that energy, only for city to give it back to the keeper and have all the players reposition instead of keeping the press. Basically giving the defenders space again.

Pressing like that will never give you results, when City press high, they stay there, and if they have to persue the keeper they'll do it, you'll never see City back out of a press except if it is explicitely instructed by Guardiola."
"It's not just that De Bruyne and Silva are pressing, but that their team has a plan on how to press.  With Arsenal, you'll get someone like Welbeck doing some extremely aggressive pressing, and behind him you'll get some half-hearted pressing, meaning Welbeck's pressing is meaningless.  Or, you'll have a whole bunch of midfielders pressing, but leaving huge gaps behind them, so that when someone makes it past that press the defence is completely exposed."
"THIS. Do we have anyone willing to do the dirty work? We need a Kante, a Matic, a Silva, but Xhaka ain't that."
"'I only said I knew what the problems were, that doesn't mean we can be bothered to fix them lmao'"
If only he knew he is the problem
Laca and Auba were pretty good too in their respective team.
"There is no coaching in this team.

Walcott and Ox arrived as hot prospects, and leave playing the same way they did as when they arrived. They are not improving as a player, and their potentials are not realized. This is true with all the other players.

If I have to take a guess, there is not much football brain in Arsenal coaching team. They probably focus on nutrition and fitness and not much else."
"The manager, poorly coached team "
There's a reason managers get paid top dollar. 
They aren't a proper team. There is no real cohesion there at all.
Xhaka was a star at Borrusia M. What happened to him?
"The organization is poor and a lot of that comes down to coaching, but really it's that the team lacks ANY true defensive midfielders.  I realize that's what Xhaka is billed as, but come on, he's a joke defensively.  You need someone who can not only make tackles, be in position, and actually give a shit, but also someone who can help to organize the rest of the team and hold them accountable when they're not doing their jobs defensively (since clearly Wenger won't).   

Absolutely mental that they bought Auba when they needed another defensive midfielder and probably a center back. As for Bellerin, he's got a lot of quality going forward and incredible pace, but you don't want him defending one on one in front of your own net unfortunately.  He's never been an amazing defender, just pretty good.  When you're put in one on one situations with no support against world class players, you have to be a better defender to deal with it."
"We are less than a sum of our parts. And like someone else in this thread mentioned, defense starts up front which for us just doesn’t happen"
"was, was, was..."
Let me give you a hand.
Thank you for your support in this tough period
"It's really annoying. They're so calm and precise. Meanwhile, cut to our defence and you have them dilly-dallying, not sure what the fuck to do, and eventually giving it straight to a City player or out of play. "
It's almost like they have better players and a tacticaly adapt manager.
"The worst thing about it is we actually used to be able to do that. For a long time, the fact that we played good passing football had kept the spotlight off Wenger and our defensive problems but now that seems to have gone down the toilet too. How Xhaka starts every game is beyond me also!!!! Its a tough life being a gooner...."
His last injury ruined him. Slow and unsure of himself now. 
He's always been prone to taking leave of his senses. He's an action man defender. Not a cool defender. He needs a calm boring cunt beside him. 
"IIRC he said that he's in constant pain since his last injury and needs regular monitoring. He's getting older, the legs are going and he's nowhere near as composed but he's always had a bit of Leeroy Jenkins in his defending. 

It's a shame because now people act like he was always shite and Arsenal fans massively overrated him which just isn't true. "
Hell yeah!!!!!
"They know what they did wrong, but not how to fix it it seems"
Mustafi is delusional. Absolute shit and refuses to accept Wenger's lost the plot.
"Good post. I was there and we looked like we had composure for only about a total of 5/10 minutes the whole game.  City were just so better organised and their players are disciplined. See Sane and B Silva stretching the pitch the whole game, leaving Aguero to be Aguero and have Silva and De Bruyne link it all up. And Pep’s in-game management, the whole game, even after scoring and calling specific players to follow instructions. I yearn for this so much after all these years. These players need help, and am not sure Wenger can be that man anymore."
"On point 3, I agree but think it's pretty irrelevant since we have the counter example only 5 days ago. We tried to park the bus on Sunday and got the same result. We also tried it against Spurs and got battered. That tactic has not disappeared and nearly all our big away games are now categorised by us ceding possession and trying to hit the team on the break. Honestly we're not good enough all over the pitch and our defence in particular isn't well drilled enough to grind out results in that fashion. I think last night Wenger's pride wouldn't let him park the bus at home, but either way I really don't think it matters against City."
It is now
can we all chip in to get this guy a lambo
"I used to love him. But for the past 2 years that love died. He should have gotten out with the FA cup win. Instead he'll leave in disgrace, whenever that day comes. There is no more glory for him. It's impossible."
"Beyond that there's not even any reason to watch any more league games, 30 (three zero) points off the top, solidly mid table, no way we are catching Chelsea or the spuds for that matter. Might tune in for the Europa League but not keen on watching the players mumble about bouncing back from a 4-0 defeat in the first leg."
Fire Wenger. Hire Diego Simeone.
You don't believe he actually will do you
Why would he? He'll get a new contract offer as long as we're not scrapping against relegation.
The sun is hot. 
If everyone is cutting through us like butter and we can't keep a clean sheet to save our lives it is us. Credit to them but we are dog shit
"How much did their team cost? After a while, the bottomless finances were bound to tell. B Silva, Aguero, De Bruyne, Sane, D Silva. Pep can just go out and get whoever he wants. Oh, need a defender? Here's a fortune for Stones. Oh, need another one? Here's another 35M for Otamendi. Not enough? Okay, have 65M for Laporte. 

This doesn't excuse how poor Arsenal have been tonight (and for much of the season), but City are the embodiment of everything that's wrong with the European model of pro football. It's all down to money and whoever throws around the most cash will eventually get everything they want. "
The stages of grief.
"Step one: Buy dumptruck 

Step two: Fill dumptrack with cash

Step three: Pour dumptruck load of cash on Maurizio Sarri."
Liverpool’s two keepers are worse than Cech. 
Say whatever you want but come on. Alan Pardew.
Yep. That's where it all starts. If your manager is shit then your team will be shit. 
"Well Monreal has had this season and I believe 2 seasons prior where he looked very close to, as well as Koscielny had a 3 season run where it would have been near impossible for any CB to displace him. Being bad now doesn't mean at their peak they weren't."
Sorry for your loss. 
"That's what I thought at first, how can we be expected to compete against one of the best PL sides in history, probably doped to the gills as well, then I remembered Sam Clucas cutting through our defence like prime Ryan Giggs twice in the same match, in the same manner as Sané and Silva. So, yeah, the defending is just shit."
defending from set pieces all season long and such seem to discredit your point very strongly
Yes the defence is absolutely fantastic probably the best in Europe. 
"Nah the defense is shit. All of city's goals came from shitty defending. Kola was right in front of B. Silva, D. Sane went past two of our players and D. Silva flew by Bellerin, and we were just toyed with on the third."
"Bellerin was left in an impossible position and is the only one deserving of any praise in that sequence. Go back and watch as he sprints inside to try and mark De Bruyne who - because Xhaka isn't even in the fucking frame - is left completely unmarked. 

Now I don't know about you, but from what I understand leaving arguably the best midfielder on Earth completely unmarked in the middle of the pitch with the ball at his feet is a bad idea - so kudos to Bellerin for at least making a strong effort to cover a danger man who isn't his responsibility in the first place - lord knows Mustafi wasn't gonna fuckin' do it. 

Then, after De Bruyne casually takes a first-touch nutmeg through Mustafi's useless legs, and while he absurdly quits on the play to appeal for offsides, Bellerin actually makes it all the way back to try to cover Sane. Expecting him to go back post (which is what Sane does) Bellerin goes where he should - so does Cech. Sane being absurdly talented however cuts in front of Bellerin to walk the ball home. 

The movement from Sane was brilliant and he beat Bellerin. Really good players on great form will do that. But it wasn't because Bellerin was poor - he was the only one who actually looked like he understood what was happening out there. "
I don’t think anytime is spend on defensive positioning. 
60 second work of art here
COYG
This. 
I don't know you... but on what I know about mustafi I'm going to agree with you.
"You may or may not be more talented, but I bet you wouldn't quit on half your assignments during live play to appeal to a referee to bail you out. "
"At least Bellerin busted his ass and tried. Came all the way inside to try and cover de Bruyne's run because Xhaka was, predictably, nowhere to be found, then gamely made it all the way back to try and cover Sane. He got beat, of course, but at least he fucking tried. 

Mustafi meanwhile proceeded to get nutmegged by a pass, throw his hands up in the air to appeal for an offside that clearly wasn't offside which he should know since he was the fucking offside line, and then immediately quit on the play by despondently jogging back toward goal when a better effort would've seen him in position to clear away Sane's first touch. 

Pathetic. Shambolic. Disgusting. Pick your adjective to describe ""really bad,"" and Mustafi is it. It's not just that he's a shit defender, but he's a bitch. He just fucking whines incessantly and gives up on plays. He's cost Arsenal three goals against City this year by giving up on live plays to complain to a referee for a foul/offside.

As a City supporter that shit disgusts me. I can't even fathom how I'd feel as an Arsenal fan. If someone could be (figuratively) dragged out back and shot for treason, this would be the time to do it because that defending is a god damned abomination. "
Im sure he did bollock them. Even Xhaka TRIED to do some defensive wiork. He was still shit at it but he did try a bit. 
You got it Ty. He clearly deserves his salary and that contract extension based off the last 5 mediocre seasons. 
Lol what? 
you're basing that on...?
seething
"This is the worst part for me.  The only thing I feel is acceptance that these kinds of Arsenal performances won't stop for a while.  No hope, no dejection, just a void of acceptance."

"The year Bayern won the treble, Heynckes was getting Ribery and Robben to track back as well.  You should Attack as a team, and defend as a team. "
"You missed his point. The point is that dirty work is the job of EVERYONE, not just a couple of hard men."
"To be honest, when Lacazette has played you'd often see him steal the ball, or at least try to, in the midfield. He'd make a run to intercept a pass or put in a tackle when a midfielder or defender is receiving a pass back, initiating an attack for us. 

When ever he's done that I've thought it would be great to have two strikers, so that one of them could do that sort of stuff and start a run forward while the other receives the pass that starts the counter-attack and eventually plays it to the striker who took possession initially. 

Lacazette-Aubameyang could be that sort of combination, maybe, but we'd have to set up as a 4-4-2 or something like that."
"Our most close call to that is Wilshere, but it seems only him wants to win the fucking game."
"Fitness? Nah mate, don't think so. "
I think the issue stems from up front... 
So why is Wenger being paid top dollar?
The point is 11 players dont considerably drop in quality without something being seriously wrong
On a regular basis our opponents look like they have two or three more players on the pitch than us. We're so fucking shit at the moment. 
"Well to be fair, Wenger’s Arsenal teams in the past have been pretty good at building up from the back (even if it takes 5 minutes)"
"
>tacticaly adapt manager

The word you mean is adept, mate."
A what kind of manager? I'm sorry I don't understand.
"I don’t think he’s been the same since he was named (vice) Captain. I remember it having an immediate negative effect on him, as he’s been pretty much captaining the side with Per out."
What do you want him to do? Come out and publicly shit on either his boss or his colleagues? 
"Oh I agree completely. We're a step behind to every ball, and we look like a sieve when they're on the counter. It's completely unacceptable "
You say it doesn't excuse this shambles yet making an excuse is exactly what you're doing. They've bought well while we pay 35 million for the likes of Mustafi and Xhaka. They also have the best manager in the world. Let's stop being salty and just admit that they're doing great things while playing fantastic football. 
Stay salty my friends
I'd take Karius right now over every goalie we have. 
"If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup"
"I guess the definition of world class varies on this subreddit. I think World Class is someone that can start consistently on Real, Barca, Bayern, etc. Monreal and Kosc wouldn’t get into any of those teams as a starter. "
"Thank you, friend. It has been a super long week, lost an angel on Tuesday :("
"Look at how those attacks started from. From lost possession and counter attacks. It's just too easy for the arsenal defence to play a high line when attacking and break into shambles when the opposition breaks into counter attacks.
The leroy sane goal, notice from where sergio aguero starts his run and then take note of our defenders line. bellerin was fortunate enough to reach till sane but still a bit unlucky to not be able to clear the ball."
"The plus side is Mustafi was at least on his feet, which makes a change to the usual reckless abandon with which he flies into challenges."
All he has done for us in the past. All the stuff from way back when.
"I forgot what rooting for a club that I actually like feels like. 

Like, I still bleed red and root for them. But god do I hate them and what they do to me"
"This is on the players. Wenger is gone this Summer, no way around it. But these players lack everything but technical ability. Hopefully a new manager brings it out. I just refuse to believe Mustafi, a WC winner, is this poor. "
"I'm a City fan, but Illini Nation comes way before it for me."
"and my point is we don't even have the hard men who can jump start the collective effort. xhaka not being a kante or matic leaves holes that others have to fill in, which then creates more holes and then we end up with mustafi chasing two players on a breakway with his hands in the air."
"Yeah, you defend as a unit, look at city silva and de Bruyne harassing our defenders, pressing, our team doesn't do shit in that department "
It’s been stemming from up front for how long now?
"Wenger met management target.

Sadly Arsenal management target and fans expectation parted ways long time a go."
Manager
">in the past

Key term here."
Arteta and Cazorla were a big part of why we were able to do that
Thanks english is my third language. 
A manager that understands and is cabaple of implementing good tactics in the team. 
"If that were the case, you’d have to imagine someone telling him to grow the fuck up by now."
"It's not making an excuse because it doesn't excuse our performance. It explains their success,which isn't just limited to just against us. They're fucking toying with everyone else and it's because of the money. We're shit against everyone, so this isn't an excuse at all. "
*SHUT UP*
"Koscielny in his prime probably could have started at those teams. especially considering two summers in a row Barca were hot for him. 

Koscielny is a long way from his best self, and with a recurring achilles aggravation it is very unlikely he will ever find that form again considering one of his strengths used to be his speed.

Monreal will never be world class (eve. If he continues this seasons form), because like most of our recent fullbacks, he is much better going forward than he is defending. To me Monreal during his best spells are decent step away from World class. 

My main point is that for spells in their career, especially Koscielny, I can understand the world class arguements."
"Obviously what youre saying has something to do with it but I dont think thats only one factor. Your argument forgets to mention that on the first goal there are two players in reach of B. Silva with Kola in position to make a tackle and on the second goal city players playing around in our box with close to zero contention. On the first two we're well within our box fairly compact. It doesnt seem to be from being too far up and spread too thin on those two. Just poor defending, ball watching, and lack of desire to win the ball. I mean there are players who are nearby doing nothing while city is in or around our box. Compare that to when we're around their box and there's immediately players putting high pressure on us. 

Doesn't really matter discussing whether its personnel, motivation, or tactics though, our defense is shit no getting around that.   "
"Unfortunately, we play in the present. The present where we get beaten by Bayern, Nottingham Forest and Ostersund alike. The ""job"" that he's required to perform is located in the present. 

Let me put it another way. There was a time that spears and chariots were THE means of waging war. There's a reason why the USMC are not armed with spears."
"I don't feel hate or anything and I still support AFC.  I just can't defend these kinds of performances anymore.

I used to look forward to Wenger's prematch press conferences and AGM speeches because I believed he was going to get it right and Arsenal were going to get positive results on matchdays or they'll compete trying.

That's all gone.  It's completely gone since 15/16."
I said the exact same on r/soccer and got downvoted. I love this club but waking up early in the morning between 2-6am (Australian) just to watch us get smashed is just too hard. I love my club and I won't ever stop supporting it but it hurts to see it decline this severely.
I feel the same. Not excusing his performances but we make a wc winner look like Sunday league. 
holy shit City fan that goes to UIUC? wassup
I just wish one of my teams could perform at least close to expectations
"You don't need anyone to jump start the collective effort. You need players to be instructed, and drilled, who on city's team today was jump starting their collective effort? They played Gundogan as their holding midfielder. There is no structure to our defence, and no press. So city could do what they want, if they were at home they would have scored 6 or 7.

This is a coaching problem."
"i agree with you. I think effective team pressing and smart possession (like pep's style) is good for confidence as well. attackers and attacking midfielders, if their confidence is low regarding possession/attack, can regain some form of confidence in contributing to getting the ball back via tackles/press. if the whole team does this, then the team is also more confident in possession. firmino's work rate comes to mind, particularly in regards to the humility in his style of play, so selfless in terms of possession AND relentless pressing /endrant"
"It's not just that they do it, it's how they do it.

When a team like City presses, they force Arsenal to pass backwards.  When Arsenal presses, it's only 2-3 players, leaving many passing lanes open.  The City player just needs to find that open passing lane, use it, and suddenly they're behind the midfield with only the back line to beat."
"Years, sadly."
We seem to have forgotten building from the back doesn’t always mean side to side passing which is what most players for years on our teams have done: play it safe instead of looking for a forward pass. We used to be a great counter attacking team because in 3 swift passes the ball was 40 yds upfield.
"All good, you're *adapt*ing well!"
This always weirds me out because people usually start off with English since it's arguably the most important language. May I ask what your second language is?
What's a tactic?
"I think you're looking for ""adept""."
"I understood up to implementing and then it just seems like you're talking gibberish? What's a tactics? How can one be ""good?"" I didn't think good things happened in football. Maybe I'm confused"
Money is just one part of the equation. United are doing fantastic with all that money aren't they? Buying the right players plus good coaching and management is key. Pep is the best manager in the world that is why they're toying with everyone. Look at Tottenham as well they've hardly spent and are doing great due to Poch being a fantastic manager. 
Tbh I bet most people in the Emirates wish they could float away 
"I hear you man. I used to preach to my friends that as soon as we could compete financially (once emirates was paid off) we would be back on top. Then the 13/14 season gave me so much false hope. Each transfer window after that I thought we made good moves and that something would change. Sanchez, Cech, shit I even thought Xhaka was a great signing. Nope. Just less excuses to justify our shitness and more reasons to be disappointed"
"Same issue here can't justify ruining my day either staying up or getting up at 3, 4 or 5 in the morning to watch this clusterfuck. "
He played about 100 minutes in the world cup. It's not like we've turned Germany's 1st choice CB to shit. Just Germany's 3rd/4th choice...
"Old balls (28), I was class of 2012. What's going on?

This is honestly my first year trying to watch soccer. I wasn't even trying to pick a great team, I was just going through FIFA 18 and I liked City's logo best. I'm a designer, so that did it.

And then the first game I watched was that match against Stoke and I knew I made a good choice haha. It's been fun following the Prem though! I'm too new to hate any teams yet, I'm just having a good time."
"I feel you, my man. March without basketball is shitty. We have the right people in charge though, the arrow is pointing up."
Norwegian is my second language and Somali is my native language. 
"Globally, it is inarguable. 

Locally, however, not always. "
Why are you messing with me? You understand what I mean with tactics. Maybe I've misspelled it but you know the meaning of the word. 
Nah. It'd be even colder up there
Haha true true. Still though
"no joke I became a City fan because I discovered them in Fifa as well. my first was fifa 11 and the fact there was another Manchester team besides United that was good blew my mind.

also I'm currently a freshman at UIUC so i've got a way to go lol"
"Agreed, I just hope it actually happens"
Dope
That is exactly why I wanted to know (:
"He is, what we call it on the internet, ""trolling"" you"
"You mean ""wengering"" you."
"F5, you may now rest."
**NOW CANCEL GIROUD**
Save us African Ronaldo
I want to hear Martin Tyler scream “Aubameyang” anytime he takes a shot.

Now ANNOUNCE HOLDING MIDFIELDER "
I'd love for us to snake Chelski now and not sell Giroud.
[YO PIERRE](https://twitter.com/Arsenal/status/958659812031594497)
And so my watch has ended
Not believing this until Ornstein confirms it.
Never thought it will happen. My eyes have been opened by Sven
commenting because I just want to be part of this thread
Let's all have a wank!
LETS FUCKING GO UPVOTE PARTY LADS
"Wow

Can't believe we actually got him.

COYG"
Save us Pierre 
Yes welcome Auba I hope you scor lots of goals for us. Now wheres that guy that was gonna tatoo the shit on his arse if we signed Auba. 
Now don't sell Grioud. Keep him. A fuck you for the Demba Ba incident plus we'll need him in the Europa league. Can't we be the pricks for once? 
YES!
Can he play center back?
 Feels weird seeing Official club posts not being posted by u/BenjaniMaples
I should be happy but after yesterday it just seems like helping a sinking ship by adding another sail
"Apparently I've won the karma race. Am I supposed to hold a speech or something?

One of the best thing about the transfer is, that the Media Team risked everything in their Mhkitaryan Behind-The-Scenes Video and lost. [#YoPierre](https://instagram.com/p/BenJnxej9ro/)

>Welcome to Arsenal, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang!  
The 28-year-old has joined us from Borussia Dortmund on a long-term contract for a club-record fee.  
Our second signing of the January transfer window, Auba is one of the world’s most highly-rated strikers. He scored 98 goals in 144 Bundesliga games for Dortmund and had a hand in 172 goals in 213 matches in all competitions for his former club.  
That works out at an average of 96 minutes per goal or assist.  
Auba is the Gabon captain and all-time top goalscorer, and became the first Gabonese winner of the African Footballer of the Year award in 2015.  
This deal is subject to the completion of regulatory processes and Auba’s squad number will be confirmed shortly.  
We hope to be hearing from the man himself very soon - watch this space for exclusive Aubameyang content!"
The Train has Arrived!!
Arsenal going to be so good in Fifa now 
Out of the blue 
#yopierre WELCOME TO ARSENAL
Score a hat-trick against the scum at Wembley next week and become a legend
I'm ecstatic but feel numb at the same time. Good ol' Arsenal!
"No matter what happened yesterday, this still has me hyped as fuck for our attack! "
"I'm sorry /u/Superwenger 

I've lost you a tenner. "
Love him even more knowing he signed after yesterday's fuckery
"HYPE TRAIN CHOO CHOOOOOOOOOOO.. now if we could get a defender..

#pulltheplugonGiroud

Front 3 of Laca, Aub and Mhk... cannot wait to see Iwobi, Welbec and Giroud this weekend!"
Wow . Came out of no where. 
Who wants to put money on Welbeck starting over him next week?
I'm exhausted... feel like I just given birth. COYG!!
"Yasssssssssssssss we're winning tge quadruple next season, yasssssssssssssss!
Man I've never been this happy. "
NUT!!!
\#YoPierre LOL
"Ok now we just need to quickly sign a DM in the next few hours. Quickly! Do it now, do it!"
I won't believe it until I see it on goal.com
Dicks out lads!!
now a dm or cb we need that shit
#YoPierre
"We finally have a good striker, god is good"
Can't believe they got it done. COYG
"Reckon he'll be any good in our setup? 

Just watched his 2016/17 [goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdWVorPSdM8) and a bunch of them are tap ins from great balls from dembele. Can't see him getting that kind of service at Arsenal."
Now we just need a new keeper and at least one defender 
Last night killed my vibe. Yay tho.
Wheres the announcement video....
I just came 
The train has arrived lads!! 
😍
That shirt looks a great fit. 
WELCOME PIERRE! 
HELLZ YEAHHHHHHHH
SHOOOOOOOT

Heloooooooooo
AuBAAAAMyang !!!!
Cmon
REFRESHES PAID OFF
LOL HE ACTUALLY DID IT 
holy fuck didnt expect this to become reality
YO PIERRE
congrats on winning F5 race!
I wanted a CB or CDM but wow I’m hyped for this. Can’t wait for his debut. Will be very interesting to see if and how he plays with Lacazette.
YOP YOP YOP
"LMAO confirmed
"
"Oh fuck it I'm happy again. We gonna win the league in May, lads!!!"
"Finally, the F5-ing may end."
COME OUT HERE 
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED 
"It is done, it's done

"
"Not gonna lie, seeing Aubameyang in an Arsenal kit does make me smile from ear to ear. 5-4 win every match hype train begins!!! (let me have this)"
"FINALLY. Mate remember to bring some keeping gloves too, might need it soon enough "
yay
Oh my god finally! Very relieved that the transfer actually was finalised; was pretty worried we'd fuck it up somehow.
^^choo ^^choo
FUCK YESSSSS
YOOOOOOOO
IN
NA NA NA NANANNA NANANAAAA AUBAAAAAAA
*sploosh* arghhhhhhhh 
Can you play CB?
Praise the Sven
Now get to work on all the other players we need to sell and replace. 
ayyyy we in business boys. 
I DEMAND AN IVAN GAZIDIS STATUE OUTSIDE THE EMIRATES!
I'm happy Robbie
Heyy Mr.Aubameyang
LMAO Laca Micki Auba Ozil
Mkhitaryan >>>> Ornstein ???
It ACTUALLY happened!!!!
I'm having a really shitty day so I'm glad Arsenal did something to make me feel better 
At this point I feel we could've just played Nacho at striker instead.
Welcome to Arsenal Aubam-bloodclart-eyang 😀﻿
Everyone on /r/soccer hating now lol. All of a sudden he's old and overrated.
Last time I felt this surreal was when we signed Ozil on deadline day jeez. 
"Yesterday has completely overshadowed this for me. I am super happy we have shown we mean business by bringing in a worldie, but this is far from solving arsenals problems. 

"
"Brilliant, apart from still needing to address our defence, surely he should play with Giroud rather than Lacazette right now? (Really hope we don't lose the  BHF)"
"A player who i was always transfering in FIFA13 now officially signs for us, but IRL. What a time to be alive.

Now get rid of Wenger, hope the board vanishes and some new meat in defence, perhaps an addition to midfield and might be good to go?

Yo Pierre’"
"All I'm excited for 

https://twitter.com/TheFalseNein/status/958660117255409664/photo/1
"
"If we sign Draxler next summer, I’ve predicted most of this squad on fifa 16 career mode. 
"
NOW SIGN A FUCKING GOALKEEPER YOU CUNTS
What a time to be alive... Ozil is a gunner until 2021 and we have Auba and Mkhi! 
"Lacazette top Ligue 1 scorer.
Aubameyang top Bundisliga Scorer.
Ozil top most BPL assists"
Now we should demand more 💰 for Giroud since we know Auba is done. £25m or Chelski can fuck off.
When do we get to see him smash a piano?
Oh snappp incoming 4-3 scorelines rest of the season
"Lmao that ""Yo Pierre"" thing people saw in the Mkhi shoot was actually legit."
"🎶Bameyang, Bameyang, Bameyang, Bameyang, Bameyang, Bameyang, Bameyang...

Bang them goals like all day. 
Now convince Giroud to stay🎶 "
"I went to bed in the early hours, woke up around noon, did one final f5 and went back to sleep the sweetest dream ever. "
"I'm sure I'm not the first one to suggest this, but does anyone else look at Aubameyang and see Anderson .Paak?"
What does this mean for Lacazette?
What a photo. Truly an eccentric character. Love the Gabon Beast.
I'm really happy we signed him but i just fail to understand why such a prolific striker who is 29 and has at least a couple of good years in him decide to join Arsenal. We can't even guarantee CL to him. We don't even have a defence
Can't even really get that excited over it after yesterday tbh.

"Can't remember the last time i was so unexcited by a signing (even as big a signing as this). The past couple of seasons have completely knocked the wind out of me, and I used to be the most optimistic. Even with a player like Auba, nothing's going to change and we'll still put in half hearted shambolic displays and lose against teams bottom of the table. Always been wenger in but something's gonna change. Europa is the absolute minimum this season"

Choo choo 
What a wild ride. Let's hope this is for the best things to come.
Thank u 
Didn't doubt our transfer strategy for a second...
Feel like i just finished a two week prison sentence 
So much free time now that it’s done...
"Wait, has the Giroud transfer to Chelsea gone through yet? can we fuck them over and keep him? "
This guy fucks 
Now can we just not sell Giroud to Chelsea for the craic 
now let's not send over Giroud and hope those Blue fuckers panic buy Slimani for 35m!!!

It's a start though - now get Ozil to sign that new contract!"

Was actually worried this may fall through but ... WE’RE GOING TO WIN THE LEAGUE

He'd better perform at 110% for us. Ollie leaving for Chelsea is just too high of a price.

I'm excited for this signing but I'm gonna miss giroud if he goes :(
"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO







FUCK CHELSEA"
UPVOTE PARTY
But what about the defence ? Loool Pierre will be at Man City in the 2 years :/
Yes! Finally. Thank fuck for that. 
Please can we pull out of the Giroud to Chelsea deal now? Go full Demba Ba on them...
Every player looks good in an arsenal kit.
THANKS AUBAMEYANG MEMES FOREVER
Tremendous signing. I'm praying we pull the plug on Giroud to Chelsea now. That would be the cherry on top.

Finally a good signing. Does this mean Ozil stays?
The train has arrived to its platform. 
Great news! Now we just need a new manager.

"Fuck me, they actually announced it in the morning. They didn't wait until the last minute until we're all ready to practically pass out from anger/nerves."
**BREAK THE INTERNET!!!**
Commence subdued yippikayayiee!!
"Alright!

Now that we've replaced Alexis and Theo, we can finally turn our attention towards a defensive midfielder :)

Wenger?... Sven?... Anybody?..."
Does this mean we are going to lose him every year to the African Cup?
"Now that we have Aubameyang, we will finally have the strongest, most potent attack in the history of football.

I predict we will easily score about 4 goals per game, around 75 in the next 20 games and we will win the PL and the CL. There are no more weak spots to this team.

Glory Glory Arsene Wenger!"
"I want to get excited, but we spent a ton of money on a world class striker a few months ago and made no effort to get the best out of him. I hope Aubameyang has better luck."
Fantastic signing. Lets finish the window off by fucking chelsea off and keeping our handsome Frenchman 
So no exit Giroud (yet)? :)
#YES
"This is a shit hot signing, but is that mhkitarian guy yours too?

I think he's probably gonna be a better signing you know, I really really liked him at Dortmund and wanted him under klopp. Don't  be put off by him at United, he isn't the first and won't be the last solid player to stagnate at old toilet, look at Angel.

I just wish my own club pushed for deals like yours has recently... we got rid of our Sanchez in coutinho but there's ""no value in the market""

Funny how you guys created value by throwing bids out. Peace"
Now buy a CDM and CB ffs!
"It's weird that the announcement seems rushed - his pictures aren't well edited yet, there is no interview from him or the manager, the video of him scoring goals for BVB on Arsenal Player is named something like 23452_Dortmund_goals_Arsenal_Player_front_page.mov ...

Considering he has been in London since yesterday, so they did have time for all this even though it was matchday, maybe there were really doubts until the last moment after all."
"One of my best friends is a Dortmund fan and he never let RVP and Sanchez leaving Arsenal go, now its revenge time boys #YoPierre"
You guys think we're getting someone else today? We really need a DM and maybe a CB (GK?)
"Oh god, thank you so much for taking him! Glad He is gone."
"Despite the result, this is a huge signing."
To the front page we go!
Next season will be fun at least.
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Can't see many teams keeping pace with us after this signing. Front 3 of Lazacette Ozil and Auberyameng is insanely good - like rivalling psg kinda levels of good. With that much firepower, we surely have to be odds on favourites for the league next year and Europa league this year. COYG!! "
All this f5-ing and they go and do it when I'm asleep...
NOW LETS GET THAT OZIL SIGNATURE
Can he play in goal?
"I know things haven't been great but this time last year we were crying out for a decent striker. 

Now we have two of the best in Europe and I'm sure most of us would never have dreamt about us having Lacazette and Aubameyang starting together up front for us."

Ya no offense they don't need another striker they need a better defense and perhaps a keeper who isn't 40 years old.
Good luck with that strange fuccboi 
Thank fuck this has finally happened. From all the absurd hype that’s been building I certainly hope he realises what’s he got himself into
No takesies backsies!

"We fucking did it boys!

So chuffed right now"

BIG NAME
Can he play defense or goal keeper though?
Auboneryang
"Truly brilliant news which combined with Ozil's new contract actually offers some light at the end of this long dark tunnel we have been in!!

Unfortunately, I haven’t actually seen this guy play too much (excluding the occasional highlight here and there), so I don’t know what he’s like for the full ninety, but his stats certainly indicate he may give us that edged we’ve sorely lacked (no pun intended) for some time up there now.

Let’s get this up, up, up voted!"
wish he was 2 years younger
The worst part is I don't think we'll improve really at all because of this signing. 
"With the recent new signings and we've sorted out Mesut's contract, the fresh blood, the cleared minds hopefully you would expect Arsenal to get a fresh start, but we're seeing that our defence is not in shape and if we do not fix it we are half a team... Again... As usual... Now then what happens? We lose games, fans get angry, they shit on players, players lose confidence, everything is sideways and we can't win a PL or even go high in CL..

This is the circle that we need Arsenal to escape and I think the best way is to carry on making really aggressive signings and change the squad enough to not have anyone remember the last 5-10 years. I think truly this is how Arsenal can dominate and achieve our goals again."
Another quality player on the scrap heap.
I was really expecting a NHL thread...
More like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang signs for Dortmund’s team B. Hahahahahahbaah where’s your European cup?
Is that it? The yo pierre video of his reveal? Just a 4 second head shot reveal. Was that his reveal video? Clearly the sanchez piano reveal video was way better if this the case.

There have been rumors that we’re in for Max Meyer on a free. He used to be an attacking midfielder but has apparently been playing DM this season. Could be interesting and wouldn’t be a bad deal on a free

Very similar to the service Lacazette got at Lyon. And unfortunately Arsenal doesn't play this way.
true... isn't like we could field world class players like Özil... wait a minute...
"Instagram, mkhi introduces him"
Can he play GK?
Bunch of hypocrites. They were saying he's world class now he's suddenly shite. Some of them must be bi-polar.
Probably push him to wing since he likes to drop deep and play people through.
"Honestly because we are crazy over reactionary and it’s ok for supporters to be. Players aren’t just assets like fifa has taught us, there are a million reasons to join a club beyond playing champions league. Think of it like getting a job, a huge cushy contract, work perks, culture, location, personal situation plus more all come into play."
As a striker who wouldn't want to play with Ozil though?
"I totally understand that feeling but this poor run of form is temporary, we've just signed one of the top 5 strikers in world football and we'll be able to enjoy that for several years, I think that's worth getting excited about."

"Honestly, even Xhaka would be okay if we just knew when to press together, ease off or cushion in as a team and play on the break.

That we were leaving our defense so ridiculously exposed yesterday isn't explained by any player's individual quality (Xhaka fucked up for the first goal but we had already gifted Swansea various clear goalscoring opportunities).

It really bothers me that we only ever go through patches in terms of playing a team game. I gather that the initiative didn't come from the manager but from the players themselves, which is not ideal, especially from a defence standpoint.

At the very least, Auba and Mkhi set us up nicely for when we get a new manager. Getting Ozil to sign the ting is key now."

Yeah 100% agree with you there. But surely an enthusiastic manager who knows his stuff can help players play together and maintain a formation/push as a team in the midfield... I mean look at Puel and Leicester. It's not just the players who have turned it around. Wenger just needs to go hard on the players and get them to bend/stop worrying about their haircuts.

Yeah we need DM at least 10 years and they don't buy DM. Last night Fer destroy our midfield... 
"Ok, that’s the impression I’ve been getting from him in FIFA actually: top quality striker in some respects, but certainly not prone to missing chances, putting him somewhere between Lewandowski and Lacazette on the overall talent scale."

Did someone say Cech replacement?

Guess you spoke too soon!
Fraud..... 
"Absolutely. I think the initiative has to come from the manager, especially now that we're devoid of leaders on the pitch. "
It's a fair question. I've also learned that the date of the upcoming tournament moved to the summer window. Pretty vital considering how Liverpool got fucked last year after they lost Mane during the winter months.
You're hired...
"I will tolerate a lot from this club, but trading Santi would be the nail in the coffin."
Umm..since we've already got Auba the ball is in our court now but we won't be assholes and stall the deal to put in new terms. Any other club might think twice but not us
"That's the only thing I'd be concerned with. I still remember how many assists he had for RvP the season before they both left, and he'd certainly slot well back into our midfield now. "
Özil over Götze though!
"how it can be good news when we buy second striker for the first squad, and ignoring problems in our defense. We buy Aubameyang and Lacazette for attack and Mavropanos or how his name to strengh our defense. It's like buying new iPhone in first day of release, and then live all year under the bridge.

i dont want to spoil all this hype fest,  but this signing it's like 'panic buy'. We got Auba not because we need striker, we got Auba because: 1 - Mchitaryan comes to Arsenal. 2 - Ozil will sign new contract, if we got him. We dont need this 29 y.o striker, but we were forced to buy him. 
"
Isn't that why we kept Giroud? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryROQ-IRKFg
[deleted]
"I would love Auba to become that leader figure with his hard attitude instead of being another Sanchez just bitching when the going gets tough. 

We need to sign that midfielder in the summer who will lead from a holding position. Shame the pickings are slim for that role at the moment.

Also what are your thoughts on Cech and replacing him next summer? I think it's a must and we need someone solid and proven but late twenties not mid thirties... Fahrmann maybe?"
"I feel like Mav is one for the future, and I completely agree that we need to do more defensively - that is blatantly obvious considering we have conceded more goals than anyone else in the current top 8, but the more world class signings we make the better, and after Alexis leaving we need more creativity up front."
We got a *real* Debbie Downer here
but he was
"The thing about Auba is that its hard to lead other than by example when your primary job is mainly to be a threat off the ball. I think we definitely need someone to pick up the slack from the midfield or defense.

This was supposed to be Xhaka but it just hasn't materialised. Lately Ozil has been dropping deeper than he should have to in order to compensate for this.

Honestly, Ramsey (or Jack but injuries) is best suited to pick up this role, and has done it in the past, but it will require some mental adjustment from him and a competent foil behind him.

If not a CB will be our best bet. Xhaka needs replacement (or severe tactical adjustment) too but can't see many ready made players for that position either. 

I haven't been able to watch football consistently this season so tbh not very familiar with all the up and coming talents, but I feel buying a younger player with huge physical and technical attributes, such as Kondogbia, and developing him may be the way to go (may be liable to make some mistakes, but won't be a constant liability in the sense of being too slow to deal with counterattacks or predictably passive on the ball).

Cech I think could improve if we have a good run in form. If he doesn't, then there's no shortage of young talented keepers and we should look to get one in."
better to be realistic than stupidly optimistic.
"You should be happy we are moving as a club, slowly, in the right direction and stop being a sad cunt. Arsenal is an emotional rollercoaster, take joy in what you can, it's a lot better. "
"you make me happy more than Arsenal, right direction, lol :D"
"Spurs bottled their **TITLE** challenge, first against West Brom, and then against a weak Chelsea side. In the Chelsea match, Spurs were leading 2-0 at one point but they threw the lead away, and displayed a complete lack of discipline and poise in the process. They then went on to lose their final two games of the season, including losing **5-1** against a relegated Newcastle side. After being clear by 5 points with 3 games left, Spurs ended up finishing BELOW Arsenal on the final day. 

In yet another season filled with disappointment for Arsenal, Spurs managed to screw up and give us a sliver of joy to end the season on a somewhat happy note. Now you might be wondering- ""How did they manage to fuck up **this** badly?"". And to that, there is only one answer:

They're second for the first time in more than a decade, finishing above Spurs after Tottenham conceded five goals to an already relegated Newcastle who was down to ten men in a game in which Spurs only needed a draw to finish above Arsenal for the first time in twenty years.

Their club captain scored in his last football game ever, their goalkeeper won the Golden Glove.

Chelsea are tenth and have had the worst Premiership title defence, Manchester City barely clung on to a top four finish, Manchester United will not finish in the top four, West Ham bottled their European ambitions away to Stoke.

Compiled from a few of my comments on /r/soccer."

"My favorite part of today was that despite knowing how tortured their fans are for constantly finishing behind Arsenal, they went out and flat out quit despite being up a man.

Spuds fans should be questioning their allegiance after the way their squad tucked their tails today.

Add on the really poor sportsmanship over the last couple of weeks as the pressure mounted and then their aspirations dashed and I can't feel anything but Schadenfreude for that team."

It isn't that they just failed either. They completely lose their composure as a club against Chelsea. Then they play at home against a relegated team wtih 10 men and just quit. I mean, seriously, 3 goals in the final 15 minutes? They simply gave up and died.

"So here's my St. Totteringham Day story.

I like to go on other teams' subreddits just to see what the state of things is and generally try to get an idea of what other teams are thinking of us and the league in general. So a while back when we played Spurs away and we ended up drawing 2-2 I went on coys to see what they were thinking. Someone on their said that Dier was really effective at stiffling Ozil which he was. I responded to that person and identified myself as an Arsenal fan, asked to not be downvoted, and then went on to confirm that Dier played really well and congratulated /their/ player. I ended up getting downvoted to hell.

And now St. Totteringham Day is upon us and the shit is where they naturally belong; looking up at the rightful lords of North London.

"Arsenal FC and Tottenham FC are two football (soccer) clubs in the English Premier League (top division). Basically we hate each other but we have a yearly tradition of finishing above them in the 38 game long season; We call this st totteringhams day. We did it again this year (21 years now, it seemed unlikely but Spuds (tottenshit) bottled it and handed it to us on a silver platter.

Tldr Happy St Totteringhams day my friend"
"Arsenal and Tottenham are north London clubs, and bitter rivals, in the English Premier League.

There are so many quotable gems on r/coys right now 
We agree. 
"I'll fix your not knowing what's going on, because it's so wonderful.

Tottenham and Arsenal are deadly enemies. Tottenham have not finished above Arsenal for a long time. St Totteringham's Day is the day when Tottenham can no longer finish above Arsenal.

We entered today with Tottenham in 2nd, Arsenal in 3rd, within striking distance of 2nd if Tottenham lost. Last match of the season. Arsenal played Aston Villa (pushovers) and Spurs (Tottenham) played Newcastle, also pushovers.

Arsenal won 4-0 and Spurs lost 5-1, with three of those goals being scored with Newcastle a man down. 2nd was Spurs' to hold onto and they completely, beautifully blew it against a team they really had no business losing to."

Honestly thought it would happen after watching thier Chelsea match. A clearer and more total collapse you're unlikely to see. 
Yep. The Chelsea game gave me a laugh but I gave Spurs too much credit thinking they couldn't choke this badly.
"I had almost secretly hoped they would do it, give the club the kick in that pants it desperately deserves. Now that we finished 2nd the season is just a ""fluke"" season where Liecester had a storybook run and how are we supposed to compete with that. Not an accurate picture by any means.......but honestly Sp*rs are shit its just the way of the world.

The only thing I can be certain of in this crazy world, Sp*rs are always shit."
"Me too. This is the funniest St. Totteringham's day ever :D

They had their best season in years and we stumbled so badly at the end ourselves, didnt sign a single outfield player, and we still finished above them :D"

Legend
The Arsenal win at Wembley with a triumph over bogey club Chelsea. Arsene announces his retirement on a high and in 10 years time the shambles of these past two seasons is remembered more for those 3 FA cup victories...
This picture just shows how much it meant to him. This man truly loves Arsenal as much as all of us here. After everything going on lately he really deserves this and hopefully we'll win it for him.
"THIS IS THE STATUE POSE, YOU GUYS!

Edit: a word"
This is truely a moment to be cherrished.
Legendary photo of the boss. 
This is beautiful
"Even though I think his time at the club is coming to an end, will always be a legend."
Love him to bits. And he loves this club deeply. He's no longer the force he once was but seeing him happy still makes me smile so much 
One more win and that celebration will be even sweeter. Bring it home boys
Absolute ledge. Hope he wins and signs off in style.
I love him and yet I want him to leave come season's end.
When you nut and she keeps sucking.
"Would love it if he wins the FA Cup, somehow clinches top 4 and retires.

Imagine an open top bus parade with hundreds of thousands of Arsenal fans filling the streets chanting his name, as he waves down at us, magnificent and classy as always. Please Arsene.

Regardless of all that has happened this year this picture makes me smile. Wenger enjoy your win and your day! Cheers boss

"I am in the minority I know but I honestly think Wenger has still got it in him for the next few years. This season I have been on the fence regarding Wenger but his biggest criticism is that mentality of players has gotten weak but today the players played for the club they played for the manager. They showed they wanted it more. 
At our best we can take on any team in the world. With another FA cup win I am confident that will be massive for the mentality of the club going forward. The mentality doesn't improve over night, usually it takes quite a bit of momentum. I remember Spain being chokers on the big stage before they became the dominant team for quite some years. We already have players with great attitudes such as Alexis, Ramsey, Ox, Kosc, Cech that fight till the whistle is blown. 

Wenger has improved tactically, has always had the bigger picture in mind and sometimes he has put too much trust in to players but more often than not it has resulted in players turning the corner around and taking their game to the next level. 

He lives for the club. He could have left for money and prestige and he didn't because he cares more for this club than me and most other people.
 Even though we probably won't be in Champion's league next year, I believe we could have a real go at the title. At the very least Wenger should get another season not out of some misplaced sense of loyalty but because he is one of the best options we have."
Arsenal Vibes! :3

This means they can announce his new contract

I see Kenneth from 30 Rock.

"CORRECTION: The year is 2018. Arsenal need a win at Old Trafford to win their first league title since 2004. The Gunners go 1-0 up early on and a tense game ensues as they try to defend their lead. With five minutes to go, Arsenal make the score 2-0 on the counter attack. Arsène Wenger goes down the tunnel early to phone José Mourinho's wife and tell her the score."
"When we won that first Ozil era FA Cup we thought it would be Wenger's retirement, but he signed a new deal. This man will die in office."
I truly hope this is the case. COYG!

"> At our best we can take on any team in the world. With another FA cup win I am confident that will be massive for the mentality of the club going forward.

Here we go again. I'm over the moon but it was one game. And people said the exact same things about the cup wins in 2014 and 2015 leading to us kicking on and instead we've regressed, we won't win another league title with Wenger in charge, it's just not gonna happen.

> He could have left for money and prestige and he didn't because he cares more for this club than me and most other people.

He gets paid £8m a year and has one of the most comfortable jobs in football. He's not doing us a favour or staying out of charity."
If the players want him. I want him.
I agree. 
You are not the minority. It's just that the vocal minority of Wenger Outs is dominant in this subreddit when we lose a game.
"Agree to some extent, it depends on what happens behind the scenes honestly. If we can add a few people to the staff (Sporting Director, new Academy Manager, maybe a new Coach, new Goalkeeper Coach most def), it'd be awesome if we could have the likes of Overmars, Bergkamp, Vieira, Henry, Bendtner & Chamakh (jkjk) back around the club - they embody so much of modern Arsenal.

After that, we have to make some changes in the squad; extend contracts, new players in, some players out. Like Arsene said; the core is there for a successful team (CL/PL trophies) but the squad needs to be more efficient. I think if Arsene will get some help then he can still lead the team successfully because he is Le Prof after all and his training and tactical methods are not outdated contrary to popular opinion.

edit: spelling/grammar mistakes "
"Vindication for what?

He didn't win anything. It was he semis. And his system failed this year. He made the adjustments far too late in the year to make the difference. "

"Come on, regardless of the Final that year those are some cherished memories. Been a Gooner since I was about 10 years old in 2001-02, was just telling a new friend of mine who became a fan in about 2008 about how magical that run was."
"Well I did say that mentality takes time to improve. We were at a handicap for 10 years financially and we still struggle in the big games and every major cup helps. 


By money I meant more in terms of going to the super clubs of the world with unlimited resources instead of having to go through selling your best players each summer to rivals."
"Yeah I think shaking things up would be a good step forward. It will also help in gradually transitioning away from Arsene for when the inevitable day comes when he leaves.

We definitely have a good core of outstanding players and even have good backup in almost all positions.

I think the real change needs to come in the board mentality. They are the ones that need to show ambition. If not it really doesn't matter that much who is in charge. With a change of manager we might get short lived bursts of intensity but long term progress depends on decision making from the board."

"And not only that. He's lived the club 24/7 for 20 years. I don't think people can comprehend how much he cares for the club, and how much it hurts him when he loses games."

"He did WHAT?! You, go to there, up there!"
"Not afraid to admit tears were shed on my part. That was a crushing loss indeed. The Champions League has been a trophy I have valued the most as a fan, and now partially because of how much that loss devastated me.

Still, those knockout stage games are some of my best memories. Henry's goal in the Bernabeu, Fabregas dispossesing Vieira, Lehmann's save...Magical."

He does not. 
"I think you're right. Of course this could easily be looked up, but I enjoy reminiscing with other fans without that luxury sometimes haha. I believe it was Henry and Cesc who scored against Juve at Highbury and I don't remember Henry's goal much at all, if I'm not mistaken for Cesc's, he cut inwards and shot into the bottom right and Buffon didn't even move.

"Ladies &amp; Gentleman, the time has come

After all the drama, its finally done

Can you believe, that 5 year's later

A new striker's here, &amp; one that's greater

Zonal marking, won't stop this man

Exploding pace, ruin's their plan.

Tell us wot, you're gonna do now

Think you'll beat us? no way in hell.

End of poem, the last line won't rhyme."

"Incredible signing for you guys IMO, as a United fan ngl it worries me a bit ha! Welbz, Giroud n Lacazette (along with Sanchez) is not bad at all!"
"Like that both Arsenal and Ornstein have both been vocal this summer.


Listing out years on the contract, efficiently announcing bids and progress and also mentioning the fees."
LACAFUCKINGZETTE
What a beautiful man.
Make sure to keep your hands and feet inside the HYPE TRAIN as it leaves the station!
"Upvote party guys!
Upvoting everyone :D"
I'm so genuinely happy right now. Football is a rollercoaster of emotions.
Most excited I've been about a signing since Alexis. Really think he's going to be a star for us. 
lol at the twitter when laca said : lacanewsigning LMAOOOO fukin my belly hurt so much
https://streamable.com/8p116

Red and white's a good look for him!
CHOO CHOO FUCKBOIS
Finally a replacement for Sanogo!
"Great signing but still have that tiny bit of regret that we didn't sign him 1 or 2 seasons ago.
"
Genuinely excited about this one! Can't wait to see him bang on goals for fun
IM SO HAPPY RN
Like a new signing!
That came out of the blue...!
He looks great in that kit
Excited to see how he plays for us. Very good signing

THERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Finally! I'm looking forward to his goal celebrations.
Oooo shit it's here! 
Nothing like an official signing announcement :) 
It is odd seeing him in the kit irl after seeing it so many times in my FIFA career mode
Well I'll be damned...
Only took five seasons! Woohoo!
that hashtag though #lacanewsigning #forreal?
Time to start thinking of super cringy chants for the new boii

"Introducing the new Thierry Henry. 

Ozil and him gonna be crazy. "
Well that came out of the blue!
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Well that's two out of a maximum of three. Hopefully we'll get another one.
What is this? The season hasn't even started.
What.. is this august already??
Found out I passed my exams and am getting my degree! Lacazette announcement is still the highlight of today.

Lacasweaty baby!!! 
"now, i wonder what no. he will be assigned.... before i can order my jersey as promised. but pls sir alexis, please confirm you are staying."
We did it boys ! now if Alexis stays this season is going to be fucking amazing !!!
"Actually happy for you guys: I'd be frustrated too. About time your board spent money on class, even if it's 3 years late."
"Man, he looks really good in that kit. "
I still want Ozil to have the No 10
Yesterday I saw Laca Ozil Alexis and Lemar playing together in my dream. I came.
Thank god we've signed a replacement for sanogo. Was getting worried we would start the season without one.

We're clever. Love how we're piling on presence on to Monaco by making it look like we've signed a different striker.

Is this what it felt like when we got Henry? 
"Can't wait to see him next season. On another note, why has he played so few games for France at the age of 26? "
HYPE
Lemar or M'bappe next?
Said it since 2012 that this guy should have joined Arsenal :D
Right now Lacazette transfer stuff is 6th and 11th on the front page so well done lads. 
Any ideas on what number is he going to wear? Any possibility that arsenal sells walcot and gives 14 to him?
"So unreal man.

I fucking love Wenger"
"Okay I just got home from work. YAY IT'S OFFICIAL... okay missing out on the initial hype has taken the wind out of my sails. anyway, bring on 17/18!!"
"# #MAFA

Now we get Mbappe, Lemar, Sidibe, Mendy, Thauvin, Fekir ........"
Time to go for Ronaldo for 60mil
Ozil setting them up and Lacazette putting them away? We're in for a treat this season!
"I'm not a web designer so I don't know what I'm talking about but the newest arsenal website redesign is rather bland, those dominant bright white, the sharp edges on everything, spaces on the right sidebar below social media card looked weird (not compact). Maybe it looked good on mobile but looks 'unpolished' on my laptop. Just throwing it out there."
"So, what number will he wear?"
Lacazette for ballon Dior 2018 anyone? 
Sadly he’ll end up being our number 7

Boom-Xhaka-Laca every time Laca scores and Xhaka assists.

"Poor Lacazette. I love the guy and love his game, I just know his competitiveness is going to throw him into a crushing depression as the season progresses. 

Perennial talent, but he is undoubtedly going to have some serious issues when we continue coming in fourth place. It might depress him to the point of no return. I'm terrified for him. He's not a fourth-place kind of guy. Him coming to a fourth place club is very sad"
I wouldn't mind seeing about 30-35 of those Boom-Xhaka-Laca tweets.
We need to sign a boom assp!
Will they emulate how song used to feed those balls to van puxxy? Boom Xhaka LaCa Goal!?
"Oh god, what have we done....?"
"No, let them leak it out and drag it over the course of the next few weeks so noone is really sure. "
"Spoiler: it was £40,000,001."
€53M is a wonderful deal. I think he could've gone for more to be honest in today's market.

Somebody got paid to come up with that. I'm seriously in the wrong business.

Better than when we were complaining of a lack o' new signings!
Nicely done
Lacazette owes me a new F5 key.
"Such an important one too. It feels so weird having a top class striker on our hands. Actually not having to worry whether Giroud or Welbeck will start.

Let's get Özil and Alexis done."
I think they might be taking the piss.

He even sounds like Henry
I like it
He is irreplaceable
He's ready for the big leagues now.
Let's see whether you'll still have regrets after this season.
Same here. Happy graduation. Happy Lacazette Day

You know the best part? Somebody gets paid to browse forums and Reddit for inspiration to stuff like that. 
Like a new signing. It's a meme about how Wenger says players returning from injury are like a new signing.

"Meh, if he scores 30 goals I'll be okay"

Maybe he's just incredibly lucky. Which makes me like him more. "

this time too much pressure from the fans
He should've missed out on CL 5 years ago then.
"Sadly even when he is given the money (Sanchez) it never helps. It seems the more he spends, the worse you do. I feel he thrives on unknown talents "
There have been backroom changes though.
Too soon wasn't it?

Huh. I interpreted it as 'lack of new signings' which we've been criticised of before. Your interpretation is probably the right one though
"It does feel like that if they have been out for long enough. Sometimes players are out for a whole season, wenger has had a lot of experience with this."
"It's not a meme, he's been quoted as saying that"
Hold the door!

"It's like a, taking the mick out of Wenger saying injured players returning are like a new signing "
I can't believe you've done this.
"Based on the number of players who have used him against me in FIFA 17, then I reckon we will be good."
"Welbeck's a useful tactical weapon, there's a reason SAF (and now Wenger) used him in important matches. Very reliable defensively and can mark someone out of a game. Not many attackers are inclined to do that, so I'm glad we have him as an option at least."

I'll happily admit I'm wrong if chelsea massively overpays for him
"I guess we'll see, Laca is a good transfer but I don't think Lyon fucked up or anything, 50 mil is really good money still"
"No way they gonna go over 70.

Value is not entirely down to them as characters. Unfortunately we let Joey run down his contract and he has only 6 months left on it. Ross still has 2 and a half years on his contract with manutd. Is it fair to say that Joey with 6 months left is worth Ross with 30 months left ? I would agree with you and say no because Ross is a sack of shit.
😂
It was already stolen from cult kits IG so go for it!

"I always thought fabianski really looks like joey

There are tons of state governments that have outlawed local ISPs etc. What's the point of having a neutral internet if the internet bill is $120/mo because the only ISP you have is Comcast? My point is it's easier to organize against local representatives, so do it. If your state has a law against competitive internet service practices (some common examples include disallowing local utilities from offering internet service), write your state senator and state delegate/congressman to push them to introduce legislation to reopen competition for internet service in your state. Get all your friends on board. Protest at their offices and vote them out/run against them/recruit someone to run against them if they don't change the law. If your state doesn't have these laws, great! Push your local representatives to pass net neutrality laws in your state. If they don't, follow the guide above. If you live in a city of >50,000, push your city council to put together a net neutrality ordinance, forbidding ISPs from engaging in this anti-competitive practice.

The old saying goes, all of politics is local. If we have 28 or 30 states where net neutrality is codified into state law the FCC will have to take a more permanently pro-consumer stance on this."

"I am all for net neutrality, but this website is supported by George Soros. I would joke about the fact that he owns 7.9% of Manchester United so we shouldn't support anything he does but that is actually one of the least harmful institutions this notorious currency manipulator is funding.

To avoid turning this too heated I will refrain from bringing into this some of the more heinous accusations against this man that I firmly believe are real, proving and listing them conclusively however would be a lengthy task, one which inevitably draw mixed reactions due to pre-conceived biases.

I will make it clear however that I will not support anything that this person is promoting. I know a lot of gunners who have researched his past will feel the same way. 

Is there not enough division among the Arsenal fan base already? I don't think r/gunners should be taking sides on these politically charged issues. 

I get that net neutrality is one of the fundamental things reddit was founded upon, but just because the name has ""net neutrality"" in it does not necessarily mean it is good for us, any more than the ""Patriot Act"" or ""Operation Iraqi Freedom"""

"A corollary to this is that when there's real competition, net neutrality should come naturally. When there are 100 ISPs instead of 3, consumers are going to choose the provider who doesn't censor content, throttle your speeds and charge different rates for different sites, every single time. If there's only three ISPs, it's too easy for the firms to collude, and if there's only one firm, collusion isn't even necessary. Government has to stop getting in the way of competition."
"We should do all that too. But price and competition is an entirely different thing from net neutrality. There's no point in even talking about making things more competitive/lower priced if at the end of that we don't get a neutral internet.

ISPs should provide internet at speed X (with different offerings at speed Y, Z...). They should not have any visibility into how we use that internet. I don't want lower speeds to Facebook just because I go through a VPN, etc."

Also our internet is shit enough as it is lmao"
"Yeah, exactly."
"Conversely, there's no point fighting for a neutral internet that still costs $100+/mo.

It's a two-sided issue. But I think given how deeply lined the pockets are of federal regulators (including the blockbuster news today about the fake comments made to the FCC) it may be worth forcing competition open, which at least staves off the threat of a non-neutral internet to a degree—if Comcast wants to throttle websites, that's fine, but an ISP charging a similar or cheaper rate with no throttling is going to have an obvious competitive advantage. Right now, in many states, that competitive ISP, whether it's a local utility, or some other big-box ISP, is legally barred from even attempting to compete for that business."
"Competition isn't an entirely different thing from net neutrality, not at all. If there's a competitive market for ISPs do you think consumers will pick the ISPs with a non-neutral internet? Of course not. The outpouring of anger over NN is proof of what the average consumer wants. We can't expect government to heed these wants when they're bought by the same oligopolistic firms they helped create."

"I was hoping it didn't come to this, but ok. Let's talk about George Soros, and again, let's talk multiple sources. He was known as ""the man who broke the bank of England"" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/229012.stm

He manipulated the british pound, bet against and gained a fortune for himself with no regard for the consequence on your country. 

Soros is associated with suspected human traffickers, John Podesta heads his think tank ""Center for American Progress"":

http://www.nnettle.com/features/853-italian-investigators-reveal-george-soros-funding-human-trafficking-and-isis

Now, you may believe the more mainstream sources but you really shouldn't... this isn't like football where the bigger news sources are the most reliable on transfers. These power players exert such influence the mainstream media does nothing but sugarcoat and whitewash their activities.

Soros is a part of a dangerous international Cabal that conspires behind the curtains to influence the world. They have an agenda (a very basic one, to dominate) and they are using various means to achieve it. You can say this is just a ""conspiracy theory"" but it's not. Not to me and millions of other researchers and reporters who don't subscribe to the mainstream version of events. 

George Soros is absolutely notorious and probably one of the most hated persons on the planet. Stickying something that he is funding is not only a partisan move, it is downright suspicious? Did r/gunners receive any compensation for this? We probably can't know that but I think it's suspicious that this petition has popped up in almost every single subreddit as a sticky at the same time.

Especially when he just moved 18billion dollars to the foundation that is funding this:

"Its not just about censorship from what i understand, thats just a caveat. I think the main reasoning is it allows monopolisation of internet service provision. The line from politicians is that the current system is against the free market as companies who have invested in laying the cable have to allow other companies the use of this infrastructure otherwise a total monopoly would exist and this a very bad situation for the consumer as there is no choice in service as no competition to keep prices as censorship in check. The companies who own all the cable have lobbied politicians for this to happen.

I dont think this could wash over here, it is so bad for everyone except the company who is gifted the monopoly, it would require an overtly corporate sponsored government, luckily we are not THAT far in the pockets of big business over here, the US is literally owned and ran by and for corporations.

I dont know for sure but i believe allowing this type of monopoly over here maybe illegal... whether that is illegal by EU law or UK law I dont know and therefore maybe post brexit thia could be a possibility."

It's not as if they're going to go right, America did it now we're going to do it and fuck you if you don't want it. We will get a say in whether it happens or not, and it's not like it will happen instantly, it will take months/years.

"**Draft Communications Data Bill**

The Draft Communications Data Bill (nicknamed the Snoopers' Charter or Snooper's Charter) is draft legislation proposed by then Home Secretary Theresa May in the United Kingdom which would require Internet service providers and mobile phone companies to maintain records of each user's internet browsing activity (including social media), email correspondence, voice calls, internet gaming, and mobile phone messaging services and store the records for 12 months. Retention of email and telephone contact data for this time is already required by the Data Retention Regulations 2014. The anticipated cost is £1.8 billion.

May originally expected the bill to be introduced in the 2012–13 legislative session, carried over to the following session, and enacted as law in 2014.

"It's been stickied so he can't downvote it and move on, besides he has a point, it's got nothing to do with Arsenal football club, if every important subject was posted here, we would have 20 stickies.. Same thing could be said about you not moving on, but oh right, you're American and you obviously have more say than the other people here, sorry!"
"I tried to keep it about this single issue in my OG post. Because this issue *will* effect how we watch games and interact with this club.

Gee, and who did that?"

"So he can just move on. It's literally one thread. Someone up above called it a minor inconvenience, but it's literally not even that. It's nothing. You don't even have to move a finger to go past it, just shift your eyes one line down and you've moved on with your life.

Some people just want to bitch and moan."
"So just move along ffs, how hard is that? Or here's an idea, dont like how the sub is run? Go start your own!"
"Exactly. The whole campaign served to normalise and even glorify bigoted comments on social media, as if they're ok and that having general respect for a fellow human being shouldn't exist or is seen as being weak.

 The Supreme Leader himself has perfected the shameless use of bigotry on twitter, but since his country elected him to the most senior office in the country, the common trumpet like our friend in the thread seems to see this as a new era of chatting dumbfounded shite on their favourite media platform.

I think that a lot boils down to the fact that Trump has no shame. Would he ever apologise for anything? If not for his grab by the pussy jibe then pretty much no. I'm glad that in the UK even our more polarising politicians like Boris have the grace to apologise when they fuck up (like last week with the Brit woman jailed in Iran (?)). But for the US, trumpets are now encourage to be non stop aggressive keyboard warriors because they're just following the example of Supreme Leader. 

No shame, no dignity, because you hold yourself unaccountable for mistakes. The first character trait the US President should probably have is dignity. "

"It is very difficult to shoot at the record breaking distances you are asking about. You need high quality optics (16x+ magnification) and training. However, realistically 16x optics are rarely used. Never in law enforcement and even in military only in very specific mission parameters. They just aren't practical for quickly finding and hitting targets. It becomes too much like tunnel vision at medium ranges.

More important than this, at that range and magnification you need an excellent spotter to guide you to the target using lesser magnification sight. You will both need to be able to calculate distance, bullet drop, wind resistance, and a number of other factors on the fly to property aim and hit your target in a timely fashion. These calculations are mainly the job the spotter, who is usually the more experienced of the two snipers. Also this is a the wrong subreddit. I suggest you look to /r/guns for more information."

"I'm not a gun enthusiast other than internet interest, but AFAIK:

Long range scopes can see that distance no problem. 2.5km ain't too far.

I get the impression that wind (called windage, for some reason) is the major factor: one must account for it throughout the shot's flight, so inferring different directions from foliage, flags, etc, along the flightpath is wise.

It's a big heavy supersonic round, i.e. produces a sonic boom (I assume?). In any case, it'll be louder than a subsonic civilian rifle. BUT: snipers say that due to the dissipation of sound at range, one can pop shots from full range and the only thing the target will hear is the thud of the round into the dirt. In a noisy environment, the could be completely missed; it certainly does immediately lend itself to being assumed to be gunfire.

What else? Fire teams of two, a shooter & a spotter, who's also a trained sniper. It's a very heavy weapon which is fired prone. Sights etc are adjusted with very fine precision to account for the flightpath variables. IIRC one must take into account not only windage, but also barometric pressure, humidity, similarly altitude, as well ass the coriolis effect, I think. Not positive about that but it IS small tolerances.

This interest lends itself to youtube nights. Go nuts! Oh, and see Shooter, with Marky Mark. Proper sniper porn."

"Im just curious as to how this could be a genuine mistake. Did you not glance at the pictures, links, on the sub?"
OP is a specialist in sniping.
"Generally, snipers work in teams of 2 men. A shooter and a spotter. The shooter, obviously, does the shooting, while the spotter generally finds, or ""spots,"" targets, threats, and other mission-relevant information, such as tracking the bullets the shooter fires to help zero in on the target. The spotter also has a more powerful set of binoculars, as well as the technology required to estimate distance, height and wind speed and direction. The spotter, or the shooter, can then insert this data into their shooting calculator or computer, which will give them an accurate assesment of where to place the bullet. 

The sniper can then use his [cross-hairs](http://ohiocitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Crosshairs1.png) to aim. Those little lines or ticks on the X and Y axis are called brackets or notches, and can be used in range finding. A sniper will zero-in his scope to a certain distance, so for example, if the sniper zeros in his rifle to 500 yards, he would expect the bullet to fall exactly in the center of the cross hairs, given no wind. At 600 yards, he would expect the bullet to hit on the notch directly below the exact center and so on and so forth. The notches on the Y-axis, going left and right, allow to correct for the wind carrying the bullet left or right. 

With all of this information, the sniper can then settle his scope where he thinks the bullet will fall given the distance, height and wind, using the rangefinding brackets in his reticle. For example, if the target is 200 yards passed what he has it zeroed in to, and there is a 10 mile an hour wind blowing left across his line of fire, he may put his target at 2 notches down and one to the right. 

Of course,  this is all fairly generalized and there is a lot of gut instinct, training, and complicated math and formulas that goes into making the shot count, but I think it's a pretty good summary of how it is done. "
r/longrange
"Remington just put out a scope that costs about $50k that uses global weather services and gps to track all this. essentially all you do is look down the scope, point the crosshair and aim. pretty neat"
"I think that shot was adjusted after seeing the impact from the first one. The do have spotters for this purpose to help them adjust and hit on the second shot. It also was a .50 cal so the impact is so big that is easier to see on even those ranges.

"If you're wondering why our nickname is ""The Gunners"", it's because the club originated from the place where lots of guns and ammunitions were made in south east London.  The club has since moved to North London and is known as 'the North London team"" even though there are some other teams also based there."
Soccer. We are all supporters of a team called Arsenal a.k.a gunners that plays in England.
I think it's one of the largest subreddit's for any sporting team 
"I see Santi as the sniper, Poldi as the heavy artillery. Can Mertesacker be the RPG? Seems fitting :)"
"""Howitzer"" I believe is the description you're looking for. "
"Both of those are just regular vollies, a half volley is when the ball is hit traveling away from the ground. He struck both of those as they were falling making them plain vollies"
"Well I remember my shots flying to the right, which would be explained by the effect's physics."
If you want to see what good bullet physics really look like then check out [Arma 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cix07R1vlhI)

We are the Tottenham haters!
"I only came here because I saw this post on the front page. I, too, had no idea what this sub was about. Your explanation explained this sub, explained the humor, of the post and made me laugh at the same time. Thanks for being you!"
"Yes, thanks! Have some gold :)"
"I actually read this thinking it was a subtle Podolski post, at first..."
Thanks for the explanation Sir. I now understand the significance of the teams nickname.
"Hmm, let's think:

Özil - Land mine (sneaky)

Giroud - Bayounet (slow but can be vicious)

Theo - Uzi

Ramsey - 50 cal (blasts through everything)

Rosicky - AK 47 (highly reliable)

Arteta - M16 (safe and effective)

Flamini - Sawed off shotgun

Wilshere - Bullet proof vest (not a gun, but takes one for the team)

Koscielny - Sandbags (see Wilshere)

Gibbs - Jackknife (always there as a last resort, see 2011-2012 WBA away)

Mertesacker - Railway gun

Chambo - Revolver

Sczeszny - Scoped rifle with selfie attachment

Jenko - Shotgun with banter spray

Note: I don't really know much about guns"
"Ahh. ""Hitting it on the up"" is the half volley. I was taught as a youngster half volley is after it hits the ground, on the up or the down. Thanks for the clarification. 

Doesn't nullify the point though!"
"If the shots are always to the right it's not because of the Coriolis effect, otherwise it'd be to the right when you're facing one direction and to the left facing the other. 

It has to do with built in constants for bullet to go off the 'crosshairs' to x,y by a z amount."
Haven't had a computer to play Arma III on yet. Still watched this whole video. 
"holy shit! I've never had gold before, though it's long been a dream of mine to receive it. Thanks so much, kind stranger!!"
You should totally start supporting arsenal now

"Kos: knife to the heart, close & quiet. On account of his tendency to be in the right place at the right time, yards from goal, first to react, last minute, vital goal, we win, enemy hearts broken."
"In this game all shots are taken from 1 fixed position, so they went right, but like others said, actual physics weren't involved, the game just faked it"
It just nice to see a nice person on the internet. :)

Secret agent Oli
"what a man 

True Gooner"
when you're a gooner at heart and made the swap to help sort out our future
This feels so wrong. I can't get over it
"I bet inside hes still a Gunner. Only there for playtime and the cash. And the fact that he wants to stay in London (or his wife) 

Love you Oli"
He really does not suit that badge. 
"Thus, Agent Oli enters the scene. "
"God, I love this man"
"Anyone seen the Departed? Chelsea might have Agent Cech leaking goals for us, but now Agent Giroud is in place with the enemy."
"I really want him to come to the Emirates, and be like 5 nil down with Chelsea, and then he comes on and scores, and we just have both sides cheering for him. "
"Giroud to Chelsea and they're losing 0-3, Sanchez to Man United and they're losing 0-2. The crazy Arsenal disease is spreading."
"Meanwhile on the /r/reddevils :

1. ""*Maybe some fans in here can now stop being so fucking arrogant and stop acting like we signed Messi.*""

2. ""*Ironically Sanchez was kinda Invisible today*""

3. ""* It feels like its been 1 step forward 2 steps backwards since Alexis’ arrival.*""

4. ""*Alexis and Martial cannot coexist it seems like*""

5.""*. Sanchez was screaming at Matic at about the 70th min because he was just lollygagging in the MF. *"""
He’s at the bridge for some playing time and a ticket to Russia and nothing else 
Hate to see him in the Chelsea blue. Love you Oli 
He looks so satisfied hahaha
Activate agent Scorpion.
2018 - Arsenal deploys their secret agent network
Whoopsie
Never thought him away from arsenal. This is unnatural. Unreal. I miss him. This hurts ... Sanchez did not matter. :( 
His wife is not getting good lovin tonight. shes the reason he is in this mess
So he's lost 6-1 to Swansea and Bournemouth in 24 hours? woof
Quality.
"It's weird because I went from hating Chelsea almost as much as United but then they got Conte who's very likeable/respectable as a manager, spurs started playing amazing (thus I went from not caring about them to hating them again) Mourinho went to United (making them 10x more detestable) add to that man city buying the league and Liverpool fans becoming unbearably smug this season. I feel like Chelsea has become like 5/6th on the list of teams I hate. As long as their recent record against us doesn't improve then I wish Oli all the best, if someone has to win the fa cup other than us then I hope it's them (fingers crossed Conte can then leave Chelsea on a high immediately after, take a break for one year, then come back and replace AW the season after next)."
I miss the man already. Hold me Oli 
"Top agent, does not even have to play to fulfill his task"
He looks weird in blue 
Haha that's great

"Is he saying ""It's all part of the plan""?"

God that man is handsome
"What time during the game was this taken, just curious? This is hilarious regardless"
"God that man is handsome

"
"At these hard time for all of us (and him as well), we must support the man, gave it all 'till the end. Love him and will always do, hoping for him to get a spot in FIFAWC, even playing for a little club."
"It doesn’t matter who it is, they always look evil in blue :/"
"Love Giroud, hope this was taken when Chelsea were losing."
Please bring him back at the end of his contract so he can retire a Gunner
Secret agent. This is what I tell myself.
I will never understand this move. He has essentially swapped one bench for another
Good on Chelsea making him feel right at home.
"Man, I feel sad about this transfer. In the summer Giroud said that his story with Arsenal was not finished and so didn't want to move to Everton. He trusted the club but it looks like he was made a pawn in our deal for Aubameyang. I would have preferred a loan deal or even a buy-back clause for us. We should try to sign him next January transfer window to make the story complete lol."
This transfer never should have gone through... 
We're fucking idiots for not loaning him
OG will be a gooner for life

He is just so used to such results that he doesn't give a fuck anymore. 
"Chelsea losing 0-3 at home takes a bit of the sting out of us losing 3-1 in Swansea. Not much, but a bit.
"
"Wait. I saw where it was rumored he might go to Chelsea. It happened? When? FML, my two fav players are gone :("
Maybe he’ll be like Fabregas who still continually posts Arsenal-related shit to this day even though he’s been on Chelsea for a while
I think he will do well there. Hazard will enjoy playing off him. He'll be in flick heaven.
Man has seen some rough games 
This hurts more then Alexis in United.. Alexis was allways a hired gun but Giruoud felt genuine on some way.. I understand the guy that he wanted to go.. But can we please stop releasing our players to our rivals?
"I think he's the first person I've seen look likeable in a chelski shirt. The clubs darkness hasn't got to him. Yet. 

How old is he btw? 15 mill seems low for someone who still bangs them in and WHY sell to Chelsea if it's for peanuts? I guess London and CL for him but blerghhhhh

LFC follower here and long term 'stop complaining about fucking giroud' advocate to my gooner friends"
Is this Giroud or a Giroud wax statue?
Im heart broken 
I miss Oli :(
Why did Arsenal sell their best striker for £18m? Someone please tell me
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Fuuuhhh tears in 3...2...
We have so many secret agents now...
"Stoooop it, my body is already dehydrated from all the crying. "
Hahahahaha! Oh shit. Only Giroud. This should be plastered all over town.
💔
And we really love him
"Not a big fan of Giroud, but this made me smile."
Oli's like: London is blue? pfftt hah
This one is gutting. Alexis pisses me off by the time he left I was happy to see him go. This one makes me sad. 
It's like a really good photoshop. It jut seems off  
"He'll come back one day, right?"
"Probably Wengers plan to take down Chelsea from the inside. If you can't beat them in the league, infiltrate them. Giroud thinking:""I can't believe it worked and no one is suspicious lol"""
">  Only there for playtime

If that, he's the Plan B to Morata (he's injured tonight) "
"Sure! The plan is to get him back for free after these 1,5 years.. ^^"
Wants to stay in his wife 😏😏
"It's an 18 month contract. Let's wait till he's in his final year and put in a cheeky bid for him back, in the summer. Just to fuck with them. "
"It’s going to be like two Canadians holding the door open for another, not moving until the other goes in, when Agent Giroud meets Agent Cech. "
"Celia Kay would let you go where you want Olli. Already did, I heard."
he definitely lost some handsomeness in the last few hours wow
Diego Costas ugly mug fit that badge.
The badge does not suit him
Kante & Hazard confirmed? 
And Mourinho is Jack Nicholson.
Should watch The Infernal Affairs first
"You mean The Depaated? 

>Who the fuck am I? I'm the guy who does his job, you must be the other guy"
He could knock us out of 1st place and I'd still reluctantly cheer him on. I'm so impartial towards the guy.
"I know we need Spurs to drop points so we can catch them but I really enjoyed watching Mou get a spanking. They're lucky it was only 2-0, United were dire."
"To be fair, why do you sign Alexis and then basically ignore him half the game? On top of that Shit were putting a hurting on him, constantly fouling him and taking him out. They made United look like dogshit. When you need Felliani because Pogba  quit, not a good sign."
Is that supposed to make us feel good? I am asking because I can't feel anything anymore.
"Popped over there for a moment, they're already bashing Sanchez to no end after a couple matches, complaining that he's going to stunt Martial and Rashford"
Wonder if we have a buyback clause. Buy him back after the world cup #likeanewsigning
He would have gotten more minutes at Dortmund but his wife wanted to stay in London
To be fair he'd likely get to Russia regardless of play time. Afaik France don't have another *good* lamp post.
"Well, she did just have a baby within the last couple days (which they named after Giroud's secret boyfriend), so she's well and truly in deep shit either way. "
"I’m so jealous of his wife, but not tonight."
A warm hole is a warm hole. He'll hit it and then fall asleep.
Well said
I'd still comfortably put them ahead of Liverpool in the fuck off ranking
I don't hate Liverpool or City TBH I put Chelsea just below United and Spurs in my hate list since I like Conte.
Wenger was  stupid for not playing him and forcing him to leave
"No way man. He's taking one for the team here, stepping aside so we can sign Aubameyang."

he's shit. nobody who understands football gives a fuck about him leaving
He’s just that beautiful
"Giroud is a great super-sub, coming in for the last 20 minutes and making that header even when the entire opposition is in the box. He's not a 90 minute player at age 31. Auba's a goal-scoring machine, so to get him in, we had to do the three player rotation with Batshuyi."

FTFY

"""Crying"""
As a person or a player?
"Londres est rouge, mon ami."
alexis is a greedy fucking mercenary. giroud was a gunner to the core. this shit is killing me.
"To be fair, I don't remember the last time they won head to head"
Well apart from Morata hes the second option. Here he would be the third so I understand why he left
I think he's got enough confidence in himself to prove that he's better than Morata. 
Not registered on time
So what was the point in him going there then?
Haha you think Giroud won't start ahead of morata?
More like his wife wants him in her xD
He still pretty on the inside tho
Lol
Thought it was just me
"It's cuz Chelsea makes everyone ugly, even our lovely Oli 😢 "
"You know, now that you mention it..."
He was ugly on the inside and the outside.

"They're right though. Sanchez will stunt either Martial or Lingard. Alexis will want to play at LW or No. 10.

He can't do that without affecting Lingard or Martial. Martial was shit yesterday at RW."
i don't think so but i think chelsea have a club option after the 2018/19 season to extend him another year
She's also pregnant I believe 
"He’s been starting though. He is their only big man but you never know

Playing at club level  = guarantee and prob guarantee to start "
I mean sitting on the bench laughing while his team is down a few goals
"Fair enough. You watch him 100x more than me. I was saying this when Liverpool didn't have a striker who could acc. score post-Suarez and Giroud was getting a very healthy return season on season.

What're his weaknesses as a player? From highlights he seems aight at hold up play, aerial duels and scores plenty including occasional bangers. Seems to be a useful impact sub as well.

I think he will score plenty for Chelsea, wish he had gone abroad or to a shit club like Sturridge did."
"Yeah but Laca was also a goal scoring machine and we all see how that turned out, be warming the bench from now on"
The player dude! Why would I have a problem with the person? People are downvoting for no reason!!! 
[deleted]
I guess last year was a pretty long time ago.
What a turn around from The first banter era session eh?
last season at Stamford bridge was Conte's only win against us I think
Ya he needs that play time heading to world cup. I hope he gets some games for the NT this tournament. That's the only time he looks good in blue.
If we plan on playing Lacazette and Aubameyang at the same time he'd still be second choice. 
Agreed. I think by the end of the season he’ll be first choice 
"I meant Morata is injured, my apologies "
Makes about as much sense as starting Giroud over Lacazette 
And only in her
Is there an Arsenal badge inside him?
he is actually a really charitable guy off the pitch.
Miraculously survived thanks to unzipping his coat and gliding over Gotham. 
"I didn't mean disagree, I think you're right. With Martial and Rashford I thought it was weird they wanted Sanchez. That Mourinho though, inevitably he will turn away from youth and buy veteran players and that's why he never lasts anywhere"
Okay but fuck them tho
"It's also not just about a starting spot, it's about being in the best form you can be. Clearly believes he'll get more game time at Chelsea and he needs it to be sharp. "
"he's become massively overrated because he scored a few off the bench this season. he's slow, average in the air, scores some nice goals but misses plenty more (never scored more than 16 in the league in 5 years which is dreadful). his hold up play is overrated because he always tries the highlight reel flick which rarely comes off. had so many garbage games for us i'm not sure how he's getting so much love, makes me sick tbh thinking about some of them"
"Auba had a higher strike rate in a tougher league, and there's no law that says they can't both play at the same time."
[removed]
"He went for money clear as day. He's on what £500k a week, if he'd moved to City for trophies and to work with Pep again I'd respect it, his wage demands were why Bayern pulled out and supposedly too much for even PSG. The guy has never stayed at a club long because he's been chasing a payday"
Remember we went a number of seasons without scoring on them
I hope there's a clause in his contract that we get him back if he doesn't make it into the WC squad. 
Morata has been shit 
Isn't that what the French NT was doing when Laca was signed?
Isn't there one in all of us? 
Wait. Really?
"Have you seen Wenger try to work a zipper?

Would have to be one very, very high roof."
"Average in the air? Fair, you would know but I always thought heading seemed like his strong suit lol... 

I guess a slow player lacking in skill wouldn't suit Gooners style of play, I've just heard massively changing opinions of him depending on the result. My own opinion was that he seemed a good, consistent goal scorer (happily would have paid 30-35 for him in that season we had fucking Balo), but the lack of a world-class striker pissed Arsenal fans right off and showed a lack of ambition.

Two questions - hows Lacazette been, and do you think he'll link up well with Auba? Are you looking forward to playing 2 proper strikers up front cos I haven't seen Arsenal do that in time, but they have to now right?

"no, not really why he left barca at all that was about playing time with neymar comming in

not that I agree with your point in general but it kinda over simplifies several situations that were all different"
"Lol. He's not on 500k, that's been disproved. And if you're just blindly following the media reports I believe it's 600k now? As for Pep, don't you think that the fact that he turned down the chance to work with him having previously worked with him in the past is noteable? And really, there is no evidence of him chasing paydays throughout his career. He moved to Barca from Udinese which is a logical step. Moving to arsenal from Barca was hardly about money. This is his first really lucrative contract, and even then he could have made infinitely more if he waited until the end of the season to leave on a free."
"net 18m, get him back for free 

even though it would mean giroud missing out on the NT, that would actually be one of the funniest things to ever experience  (after  10 man newcastle vs spurs)"
"£18m loan fee, not bad"
"Using similar black and white logic, the same could be said for Laca "
And Giroud has proven time and time again he is not good enough to be the starting striker for a club of Arsenal's status let alone Chelsea(who are actually looking to compete in Europe and for the league).
yer he built a school his in his home town in brazil.
Got me. I made it up.
"lacazette looks very average, too slow and weak to be a top striker. auba will take his place, zero chance we play with 2 strikers, we have too many midfielders who have to be in the team"
"You're right... he is good in the air, the fact he's scored the most headed goals in the prem since he's been here is proof of that. Guy you're talking too has some weird agenda where he can't even recognize simple facts. "
I'd seriously rather Giroud starting at the moment.
different kinds of shit. Laca hasn't been syncing well with the team (or not getting enough service if you wanted to be kind on him) whereas Morata has more than enough he's just dogging the chances.
"By signing Danny Drinkwater and Ross Barkley lol.

Meanwhile Arsenal's last two first-team signings are Lacazette and Aubameyang.

We are also looking to compete for the league, much more than Chelsea seem to want with their recent obsession with 'bargain' English buys (Carroll, Crouch, Danny, Barkley and the lot of them)"
"That's actually pretty good. I kinda get it though. Wouldn't judge someone by their on-field personalities. Many examples, Suarez, Drogba, even Mourinho."

"Craig Bellamy is the one that springs to mind. Plays like an absolute bastard, but does huge amounts of charity work. I think he has multiple schools (or football schools) in west Africa."
Depends who you ask. I've not been impressed with him. We've bought attacking players for years on end whilst our defence hasn't been the greatest so don't know if buying Aubameyang had anything to do with Lacazette tbh.

"No one said it was guaranteed, but it's not surprising to see that three men who are paid silly money to play a game are happy. Only clinical depression would wipe the near permanent smile off my face."
Money means happiness. 
"What is this weird thing you call ""happiness""?"
"FFS, okay."
"Depression is a disease. Why is it the only counterpoint I'm getting as if it's incredibly common? It's like of I said ""regular exercise makes you fit"" and everyone rebutted with ""but, but what about muscle wasting diseases like ALS?!""

[Recent study  says you can buy happiness](http://globalnews.ca/news/3620634/money-happiness-time-research/)
"You have quite a simplistic view of the world then. Plenty of rich people have ended their lives over depression. Even a few years ago a footballer by the name of Robert Enke ended his own life. It really annoys me when people make the assumption that money = happiness, when in many, many cases it's the opposite."
"I have more money than i can possibly need. I gotta tell you its very exciting when you first get all the things youve wanted but couldnt afford before.

Doing that is the closest thing to happiness.

Im past all buying evertyhing i want and i feel no more or less happy than from before.

Also, if stress is making you unhappy and you get lots of money those will just go away. Whether or not that helps your overall happiness

It didnt for me but i probably need a wife and kids in order to truly appreciate it"
It does not. But no money does mean unhappiness.
Not really happiness no. Having enough money to have a roof over your head and food on the table but plenty of wealthy people suffer from depression
Depression is not at all as uncommon as you seem to think it is. 
Sometimes we're just in a literal mindset bro.
Good thing. Might have been 9.
In many more cases there is a direct correlation between happiness and money. I don't understand why people always focus on the outliers. Are you seriously saying that you don't believe there is a link between having money and being happy. You have a quiet over-complicated view of the world for whatever reason.
I'd like to exchange my money for happiness points please. 
I'm sorry that you don't know how to do money correctly. But money is happiness if you do it right. 
Money means happiness. 
What is the exchange rate for USD to happiness points?
"How uncommon do you think I think it is? I gave no numbers.

Now, on the other hand, hire common do *you* think it is? Is it safe to assume 3 random footballers, for example, might not have have it?"
You've missed the point entirely. I'm not saying that there isn't a correlation between happiness and money; rather that money does not **guarantee** happiness.
"It's more about being well adjusted and not consumed by your money. Also I believe that I've read somewhere that money improves happiness levels to a certain point where comfort and needs are taken care of but beyond that, more money does not equal more happiness."
"> quiet 

Seriously, read a book every now and then. Not being able to spell ""quite"" as an adult is cause for concern. Your brain SERIOUSLY need stimulation. It seems to be dying of boredom."
"1 USD = 0,04 Happiness = 37,92 likes on facebook"
"> money means happiness


This holds true in 99,99*% of cases. There are always outliers. Bringing those up everytime someone brings up the correlation between money and happiness is dishonest to the facts. There are no guarantees in life, but there definitely are statistics. They show that you are most likely happier if you have money than if you don't. So I would go so far as to say that you have either missed the point completely or you are just being contrarian for the hell of it."
"Der er noget utroligt sørgeligt ved at befinde sig på et site med subreddits og brugere fra hele verden, for næsten udelukkende at poste i /r/Denmark. Hvorfor holder du dig ikke bare til dine venner på Nationen?"
"I knew it! With enough money, anybody can buy happiness. "
"Money makes you happy - up to £50k a year.
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/7984511/50000-a-year-can-buy-you-happiness-after-that-its-down-to-you.html"
I even explained it to you and you still don't get it. You're a special kind of dumb aren't ya mate?
"ugh, this is just not true, not true at all ! It doesn't hold true in 99,99% of cases, not even 90, not even 80. There's a correlation but it's not as simple. You talk about facts and statistics but I know for a fact you haven't dig up on this subject. How can you say 99% of cases ? I know it was a voluntary exaggeration but even then, which cases are you talking about ? If you're saying money means happiness for  a guy who was homeless and gets 40k a year all of a sudden, yeah, money makes him happy in about 99% of cases and that's hardly exaggerated.  But if you take a guy who gets 30k a year and give him 850k a year, then I'm sure he has plenty of chances of being less happy, especially after a long period of time. At first it's awesome but I'm sure there are often side effects at some point.

Interesting article, saying for example that, as it's been mentionned before : Over a certain amount, about 75 000, money tend to not make you happier. It adds that between 34 000 and 102 000 per year, the suicide rate only goes down by 10% : http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/link-between-wealth-and-suicide-rates-san-francisco-federal-reserve-2012-11/

Another article saying people commit more suicide in rich neighborhoods (could be due to a reflex of comparison rather than purely income) : http://business.time.com/2012/11/08/why-suicides-are-more-common-in-richer-neighborhoods/

As it's clearly been shown in many studies, after a certain point, at about 50 000 or 75 000 per year, money doesn't make you happier, it's a fact. So we can argue about money being happy, but one thing is sure, it's that at some point it doesn't matter anymore. By the way the premise was that these footballer were supposed to be extremely happy because they won an exceptional amount of money, but since it doesn't matter after 75 000, their money has no more effect on their happiness than dentists, lawyers, judges, doctors, surgeons and etc, but we know these guys are very very far from being ""all happy"".
_________
I know it's amazing, I'm sure everyone thought like you at some point but looks like money isn't THAT important. The first few years it's obviously awesome to get a lot of money, but over time you loose plenty of things : You loose your motivation, your drive, money can buy you everything and you don't even need to work again in your life. Of course you could still find new goals if you have self-discipline and rigor, but who said humans were self-disciplined enough ? It's hard to get your ass off your couch when you can already have all the material things you want, it's harder to see the benefits of getting your ass of your couch you know ? You also loose your empathy for normal people, your family and childhood friends have completely different problems and goals than you. I got plenty of other studies to link and theories about this but my comment is already long enough. It's a very interesting subject though, I'm not just writing that so people know rich people aren't always happy, I don't care, but it gives you a much better understanding of this world to know that money doesn't make you so much happier, it teaches you a lot and could motivate you to revise your goals in life.

I'm also writing this comment because people talking arrogantly about something they don't know are very annoying and it has to stop."
"99.99% of cases is grossly wrong. There is a higher percentage of the population than .01% that is predisposed to unhappiness and depression, especially in the modern developed world where most people don't ever have to struggle in the same way that earlier humans did. They find it hard to have a purpose or make meaning out of life and money rarely fixes that. "

"I feel the exact same way about you. You are just a walking-talking cliche. ""You can't buy happiness"" has got to be the most tired adage out there and it just isn't true in the vast majority of cases. Billions of people are unhappy because they lack money, but you choose to focus on the few who have money but are too dumb to spend it in such a way that it increases their quality of life. What an enlightened person you are. What's next, food can't cure hunger?"
"Unfortunate that the best comment here is buried. Have an upvote. 

You're spot on, money and happiness are related but there are very real diminishing returns that start at lower wages than many would expect. In broad terms, a lack of money can cause unhappiness when below a threshold to live ""comfortably"" (different for everyone), but making more is only likely to materially improve happiness if currently under that threshold. "
Good point
"Beyond a certain amount of money, you don't get more happy because of the money."
"Yup, wealthy people who kill themselves are too dumb to be happy. If only they spent their money. Do you honestly read the dribble you write?"
And there's a million other rich people that don't kill themselves and are the subject of envy for many. But again you're focusing on the outliers... (I'm not the same poster btw)

Masterful damage control after last night game.
"Great news, he absolutely deserves it based on his performances this season. 


This summer is absolutely crucial in the defensive department now. We have Aubameyang and Lacazette being serviced by Ozil and Mkhytaryan for the next 3 years. We have 2 excellent box to box midfielders in Jack and Ramsey. 

We desperately need to bring in a good defensive midfielder to replace Xhaka, a CB replacement for Koscielny (probably 2) and a new keeper, or we will have yet again squandered the opportunity we have to build a team that can challenge.  "
"This is the most important signing of the window. It’s the most important signing ever made since signing Ozil in 2014. 

I feel like we’ve been given a second chance at pushing for silver ware in the near future. Like if Ozil left, it would have been a huge blow to the club and our reputation. And I would have been bitter that we never won the PL with Ozil. But Ozil is like that really good girlfriend who sees the best in you even when times are tough and is willing to give you a second chance. 

I love you Ozil."
He joined us when we needed the most.. Extended the contract when we are down.. Thank you..
You win the karma race
FUCKING GET IN. BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SIGNING WE COULD HAVE MADE.
"Top five moments of the last five years:

Right, now I'm fucking hyped!! Lets get this Arsenal ship righted once and for all now! Extend Wilshere, replace Wenger in the Summer (Sarri, Jardim, Simeone, Ancelotti) take your pick, clear out the remaining deadwood (Welbeck, Iwobi, Elneny etc) and sign ourselves a top GK, 2 CB's, DM and RW. Lets be having you!"

"I'm crying. No one is cutting onions, I'm just super emotional right now."

That's it then. Make him a statue in 10 years!

Fuck yes what a great day - fuck yesterday!
Okay just understood why we lost yesterday... The club didn't want the fans' heart to explode.. minor heartbreak was considered relatively better
"After yesterday I couldn't get too happy after Aubameyang was announced, but this has definitely put a smile on my face. Go suck it Mourinho and Man U fans. Bet he's shit now yeah?"
What a beautiful surprise! Let's turn this season around now
OMG What a transfer window
I need to sit down 
"LEGEND LEGEND LEGEND LEGEND LEGEND FUCK YES FUCK YES FUCK YES

I LOVE YOU MESUT YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD"
Özil stole Auba’s thunder 
"FUCKING YES!!! EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO RUB MY BALLS ON SOME MANURE FACES TAKE THAT YOU WANKERS I FUCKIG TOLD YOU YOU WEREN'T GETTING HIM WOO!


Actually the happiest I've felt in a while. Now if Giroud could snub Chelsea I might just cum in my pants."
This is even better than announcing Aubameyang.
Wow I'm honestly so happy right now. I had a feeling he'd stay since he never looked unhappy to me but I never expected he'd sign a new deal already I thought it would drag on through the summer. The fact he has committed to us at this time really shows he genuinely loves this club imo. Can't wait to see him linking up with Auba. 
"Auba has been totally upstaged, welcome, delighted to have you, but.... *our* Ozil just signed a new contract!!!!! Get the fuck in!"
"This might be some of the best Arsenal related news I've heard in a long time. This means so much more to me than signing Lacazette and even Auba. 

Pls Arsenal strengthen other positions as well. "
Oh thank you god. I was not ready to get rid of the 4 Ozil kits I have just yet.
"Ditched Sanchez so that Ozil becomes top earner at the club.

This makes me feel good.
Become a legend Ozil.
Wtf. This is the best day after a loss I could hope for 
"I'm very happy aböut this möve.  Undöubtedly a generatiönal talent, we has an öppörtunity tö use the pieces in place aröund him tö play söme beautiful öffensive föötball.

"
Wow Arsenal doing everything they can to make me move on from yesterday. If we didn't actually play matches I'd say we're in great form
"Holy shit, I did not see this coming. Now, if something happens and Giroud's transfer to Chelsea breaks down and he ends up staying at Arsenal without Chelsea getting a new striker, this would become one of the happiest days of my life."
"This is by far the biggest news of the window, forget Auba, forget Mhki, forget Sanchez, Giroud, Theo, and Coq. Without Özil we would’ve had nothing of substance to build the team around. Come summer we MUST sign some defensive players and a GK or this will all be for nothing."
Just woke up in the states. Best morning I’ve had in a long time.
OMG I was sure he'd leave. I'm getting an Ozil kit next season. I love this man. 
OH MY GOD
The sort of wages that a team that’s competing for major silverware should pay. It’s time to invest in our squad. We need a cb and cdm as priority with a go in mind as well. Or wtf is even the point 
"I promised myself that if he signs a new contract, I would get an Arsenal shirt with his name on it. #Noregerts."
I love Mesut. He's definitely going to be a club legend 
Ah well that makes me an Arsenal supporter for another 3 years anyway ;)
Why isn't this anywhere else? No announcement? This should be a national holiday.
Statue of Ozil is next for sure!
"Oh fuck yes. Maybe this is because he didn’t get along with Alexis. So to avoid losing Ozil to Man U we sent Alexis there, gave him some shiny toys to play with upfront and a fat sack of money that used to have Alexis’ name on it.

Fuck I love him"
I'm buying an Ozil shirt
"Pinch me I must be dreaming I had given up so much hope of him continuing his career as a gunner but this is wonderful news, if it was Ozil's influenced that pushed the club to buying Auba and Laca then maybe the club will continue to strengthen the team with defensive signings in the summer."
YA GUNNERS YA 
"So that's around £175~£180k a week (about half of what Alexis wanted and got at Utd) for THE most important player in our attack and, as an attacking team we obviously are, the most important player."
"This is the best January window I think I've experienced  (in retrospect the time Monreal signed is a strong competitor). 

We finally got rid of Alexis; great footballer but ever since last winter (the gloves on the ground and all that) he has felt like poison to the team. We got Auba who for at least 1,5 years has felt like an unreachable dream (he was supposed to go to real Madrid not that long ago). It's a huge signing for Arsenal. And on top of that we got Mkhi who was pretty sought after not long ago. Biggest thing here though is rejoining Mkhi and Auba. 

Then Özil signs again! 

On top of that we begin to see more backroom changes that are difficult to judge now but it's a welcomed change. 

Only sad thing is Giroud. Damn, I miss him. "
"Having a job interview today, hopefully it works out so I can buy a Özil shirt! COYG"
"Reported by Ornstein, sneakily confirmed by Ozil and other players (Elneny). But have the club made an official statement or is that yet to come?"

Love how Ozil waited out Alexis so he could steal his wages."
Let's face it.  Nobody else was going to pay him that.

THIS IS TOO MUCH ALL AT ONCE.

Edit: I think I'm in love with Mesut.

Edit2: At least 1/4 of my happiness is also because MUtd can suuuuuuck it, with their smug ass faces. And Mou. Mou can suck a big one.

Edit3: ""Mesut will come to ManU because he and Mou are besties"". Fuck off, he loves Wenger.

I don’t have any issue with paying the guy his worth as we have but that’s a massive wage and we definitely need to sell some dead weight in the summer to balance it

Legend
Do I make you Orny? 
Madness
Omg what a day!!!!!
Bigger signing than aubameyang!! Ya gunners ya
Here's to another three seasons of our brilliant talisman leading us to great success in the Premier League and Champions League! 
Today is a good day!
Fuck yes!! Was more hyped about this than the other signings!! 
both are a welcome piece of good news
Best transfer window in years!
Great day! Now time for a new manager for next season to reap what we sow.
Dude took 11 minutes on his first game at Arsenal to become my favorite player.
I am so happy! Ya Gunners Ya!
/u/AfricanRain
Arsenal owe this man a hell of a lot.
I thought I could only get so hard when Auba was announced. *And now this.*
"I swear, he WANTS to, and WILL be a club legend. "
"It's great to do so much winning off the field with PEA and Ozil. Now if we could just do a little more winning ON the field, that would be great."
"Took a trip to London this year for a couple games. Bought my first kit at the stadium, with Özil's name, desperately hoping he'd stay with us. I couldn't be happier about this. "
This is the best day ever!!
"Good, now let's build a midfield and defense behind him."
Wilsheres turn
❤
My apologies to whoever it is I said to the other day about there being no chance Ozil would sign a new deal after getting it down to 6 months remaining. Big shock for me.
i'm calling it now.  he re-signed because Zidane will be our coach next year.  
I'm going to cry!!!
Actually a club legend wow I love you Mesut
Ya Gunner's ya!
Is it confirmed?
This has got me harder than any transfer news.
F U L L Y  E R E C T
Don't let this distract you from the fact that we're still shit.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!
YES YES YRD YYES YES YES YES HOLY SHITTTT
"Now that we have our offense sorted out, its time to turn to a revamp defensively."
What a great morning surprise!
#LACANEWSIGNING
Couldn't sleep last night. Woke up at 2 am after a couple hours and trolled Reddit. Auba was basically done and finally fell asleep with all these ozil rumors. Woke up to the deal being done. What a day. Glad I didn't watch that joke of a game yesterday to sully my mood like everyone else's Last night 
I'm honestly way more happy about this than Auba.
[removed]
My week has been absolutely terrible. Just taking personal L after L. I really needed this and PEA 
Thank you Wenger. What an absolutely phenomenal window
I am so Happy about this news. Lets get some silverware for this boy!
"CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES! 

COME ON!"
"Easily the most important ’signing’ in January. Now, let’s just get rid of Wenger in the summer, and drop a couple hundred mill on a keeper, a proper DM and a right back and we might just have ourselves a squad."
Best news of this transfer window...
I'm HARD
Can this day get any better? :) 
We should make an announcement video of ozil signing da ting
"HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT 

GET IN!!!!!!!!! #yagunnersya"
FUCK. YES.
I’ve given the guy a lot of stick over the past few years but this year has really shown how professional he is and how much he actually does care for the club. I’m really happy he signed a new deal.
Love it.  Start casting his statue already.
"This is more refreshing than Auba signing. This sort of feels like the day when we got Ozil. Out of nowhere, I wake up to the news that we've got Ozil, again! "
So fucking happy. Knew he would sign da ting. Happy we paid whatever we had to. I love this guy and hope he becomes a club legend. Ozil would not have resigned if Wenger was not there. Despite our season our players still believe in our manager. I think we can expect them to announce an extension to Wengers contract. I still love the guy but he needs a better defense.
Big news. Glad le wizard has decided to give us another chance at glory and stay with us to create havoc with our now seriously devastating frontline. Hope we sort out the DM and backline though. That is the biggest problem for the longest time yet. PUHHHLease AFC
">It's worth remembering that Alexis has no real connection to Arsenal, whereas in comparison Mesut Ozil - who is close to Arsene Wenger, loves London, has loads of friends here - would probably find leaving the club more of an emotional decision.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/6m0rya/im_chris_wheatley_arsenal_correspondent_for_goal/djy23f3/

Someone upgrade Chris Wheatley to Tier 1"
Brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. Now let's get Europa league and then my wounds will be fully healed.
"This shows the difference between Ozil and Sanchez. Ozil signed because Arsenal showed ambition as he promised. He came through on his words. Sanchez, well he had a little whiny puss boy inside who wanted a shit load of money. "
That is amazing! Wenger should be rewarded with a two year contract extension!
ÖZIL 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ya Gunners Ya
Thank goodness
[removed]
"I am glad that Özil decided to stay at Arsenal. I don't know what prompted him to stay (While he is the highest paid player, I don't think it's money; he had an offer from Guangzhou for 435K), but I respect him for staying with us. 

Here's to another few years of Mesut's Magic. "
😍
"With the recent new signings and we've sorted out Mesut's contract, the fresh blood, the cleared minds hopefully you would expect Arsenal to get a fresh start, but we're seeing that our defence is not in shape and if we do not fix it we are half a team... Again... As usual... Now then what happens? We lose games, fans get angry, they shit on players, players lose confidence, everything is sideways and we can't win a PL or even go high in CL..

This is the circle that we need Arsenal to escape and I think the best way is to carry on making really aggressive signings and change the squad enough to not have anyone remember the last 5-10 years. I think truly this is how Arsenal can dominate and achieve our goals again."
Very happy about this 
[removed]
Time to buy a jersey. Ill get nearly 4 years out of it at least. 
Now *THAT* is what you call a ride or die!!!
[removed]
This is really good.. This puts an end to speculation in dressing room and not a repeat of the Sanchez situation. They can now be focused. 
IF YOU HAVE AN ERECTION LASTING LONGER THAN 4 HOURS PLEASE CONSULT A DOCTOR
This would mean Wenger is leaving soon fortunately
[deleted]
WOOOOOOOOO STATUE PLEASE
they give ozil 350 but didn't give alexis his 350.  holy f*
"Honestly, I never doubted it. Chris Wheatley had mentioned it last year. 

Two things now. Ozil signing this means there will be some signings, and it also means we've decided our future with the manager. 

Hopefully he leaves Arsenal as a legend, he deserves to. 

Also, fuck the United fans who thought Ozil was joining them"
Thank god Arsenal is London based club or he would be fucking off to another club.
350k per week....what
Only stayed for the money. Just like how Sanchez left for the 'money' the irony is real.
Cue him going back to not giving a fuck.
ARSENAL LEGEND
Is this the first peak level world player we've retained in the last 10-15 years?
"
It is really sad that some Gooners online have been downplaying this. Saying that Ozil signed just so he could stay in his comfort zone, and because no other big teams were interested in him.

We have a bad tendency to talk shit about our star players. The likes of Fabregas, RVP, Alexis all left because we failed to live up to their expectations/ambitions.

It is clear that Ozil only put pen to paper after the signing of Aubameyang. Hopefully from now on we can keep all our star players. By not only paying them well, but also bringing in top quality to support them.

It would be a dream scenario to see us finish rebuild in the summer and have Arsene win the league next season before retiring."
"I guess he must like London, if I were his agent I would have a sad face that he didn't wait till after the World Cup."
"Tempted to say he should bust his ass more for the club for £350k a week, but perhaps that will just come with time as his connection with the club deepens. "
Seriously. He even came to Bremen on Deadline Day. Nice memories 
He's an artist. Him going somewhere else doesn't feel right.
Wonder to what extent Ozil staying was conditional on Arsenal buying better players.
"Because it's much better fucking news! This is the best news of the season, love it! "
Like a new singing
Özil will go down a legend at Arsenal now.
I mean aubameyang is great and definetly improve our team but it solves none of our problems. Losing Ozil would create a huge problem and seeing one of your favorite go to another team is always painful.
We need him far more than we need Auba
Same here. It's the fact we have managed to KEEP one of our world class players. It's all well and good buying them but the fact Ozil is staying is absolutely massive for the immediate future of this club. Ya gunners Ya!
Same mate. I don't mind losing Sanchez but thank god Ozil signed. Even if we didn't get PEA we shouldn't let Ozil leaves.
"Losing him would be like losing Bergkamp. Just not OK. And now that we're building an attack that uses his skills even more effectively, I'm really excited to see what the future holds. "
Wish we could say the same about Sánchez 😢
"I like to think these two moves are one in the same. Imagine if we didn't sign aubameyang(what's the consensus on how to shorten his name?), and then announce that ozil will see out the end of his contract "
"I don't think that's strange. I feel the same, and it's completely rational."
United getting Ornstein?? NEVER!
"PEAK? YOU HAVEN'T BEGUN TO SEE HIS PEAK. WHEN HE HITS HIS PEAK, YOU'LL FEEL IT."
We buying Ornstein shirts now
united getting wenger confirmed tier 0
His peak is yet to come.
almost makes me forget about yesterday 
if we retain Giroud this will go down in the history books.
upvote fyrir notendanafn
"Mesut Özil is Arsenal's best signing since Mesut Özil. I know people like what's new, and pacey strikers with crazy numbers like PEA don't get much more exciting. Can't wait to see him play.

But I'm so delighted by the Ozil renewal, such an enormous relief. We can build a new team around him, his pace will decrease in the coming years but he's the profile to adapt. He's maturing on the pitch as a character. And he's often the only one worth price of admission. So, so happy. He's truly top level and he must believe that the team in the coming years can match his ability. It's a huge deal this.

You can't help but think this is linked to investment in Aubameyang. This is what you need to do to convince top level to stay. You must surround them with quality, we didn't do that with Alexis but in the end I think this has all come up Millhouse. Given the circumstances- a lot of which was our own doing- we've done fantastically this January. Ozil though is way more than the icing on the cake. He is the cake."
He should suck a fuck
Suck a bowl of dicks Mourinho! And fuck all the United cunts who were so smug and sure Ozil would sign for trash.
MY NIPPLES ARE FUCKING SOAKING 
Get fucked United!!!
"Great news!!!
SUCK OUR COLLECTIVE DICKS MOURINHO"
a lovely salty thread about this on the Man United sub btw. 
I don't think he was ever interested in the first place.
I’d have preferred the win last night but goddammnit I’ll buy a new ticket for this roller coaster every damn year. 
"**He's Arsene Wenger's man, assists Aubameyang...**"
"I dont care about our loss, or about alexis or even about auba anymore. Get iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn 😭"
Yesssss
Class
"Mesut, mesut Ozil, he's the Turkish boy from germanyyyy, Madrid, sold us Ozil, and replaced him with a chimpanzeee."
This song would get a bit weird on the off chance we get Zidane as Wenger's replacement. 
[removed]
"#We've got Ozil... Mesut Ozil... I just don't think you understand. He's Arsene Wenger's man, He's better than Zidane, We've got Mesut Ozil﻿....#"
ONE FOR OZIL TOO
Fuck Ya!
"me too, glad as my others were alexis and fabregas lol. 

Never getting a name again though."
Me too. 
"Your shirt is fucking going over, mate."
Literally Houdini
Sven*
Me exactly
Those manure bastiches can frag right off
"Arsenal 2019 quadruple incoming


*also mesut to break assist record in every competition "
I don't think it matters if he has team success
Agree completely. One could even argue that he would approach legend status if he stays until the end of his new contract with his 3 FA cups
"YES, IF THE OLD FART MANAGING THIS TEAM FUCKS OFF , why am I shouting"
Mmmm talk dirty to me.
"Twice! In the ass, with no lube. And fuck that little dog shagger Sanchez."
"""we must reward him a little""... Like making him the highest paid player in the league's history? "
"I was in top 4, I still feel like I won a trophy"
"Switch three and for, I reasonably expected to beat Villa, Chelsea was more of a shock and we had finally won a final against a top team"
"This is a truly remarkable day. We’re keeping Mesut Özil, he wants to stay and be a part of our future. He could have taken the easy option and left, but he’s not going anywhere. "
"I'm starting to think they lost on purpose, just to fuck with us."
Going to work today with this Grin on my face. Today Is a good day.
"Same here, the great majority of my posts were always arguing that he would sign...until last night. I've been called so many names for saying Mesut was going to renew his contract. Last night was the first timed I thought he might not go through with it. Thank God it was already a done deal last week. We needed this announcement bigtime. I'm pretty sure a few people said it would be the only thing that would make them feel better is if they announced Ozil and Auba today, and it actually happened. How insane is that?"
You didn't get one of his shirts right away?
it's official

"We should be able to afford it. Before selling Giroud we have got rid of about £500k a week in wages since our last signing. Mkhi was Sanchez plus about £30k - £60k depending on who you believe so that leaves £440k+ plus Girouds £100k to pay the increase for Ozil and Aubameyang. And wages can be subsidised by money coming in from player sales and commercial revenue. This takes our net spend on players to about £15m and we also have the rumoured £90m we got for tv money so we should be fine, in fact a nice little earner for the board and owner again this season.

help it's been 3 weeks
it's been 14 hours please help
Bit weird mate.
Ozil is way more important to the team than Alexis
"Alexis didn't want to stay. Simple as that. And his leaving freed up wages to sign Ozil, who is absolutely critical to our offense ticking. "
About £200k after tax.
"I’m really disappointed they didn’t film Auba passing the pen over to Özil. 

“Yo Pierre, you want to come over here? Sign here”

“Mesut, what do you say?”

“I am a Gunner.”"
"If he had gone to United it would literally feel like the end times for me. And I mean the Biblical End Times, just to be clear."
">He’s an artist.

This. This is why he always belonged at Arsenal.

I look forward to seeing how he clicks after some time with Auba and Mkhitaryan."
Pretty fucking important I'd imagine. I hope the club doesn't fuck him.
"The fact that this is happening on the same day as the Auba signing is likely not a coincidence.

If the window had just been Ozil signing a new contract I still would have considered it a success. Getting Auba and Mikhi on top of that is amazing news.

Now, all we need to is sort out the midfield, goalkeeper, and defense! "
fact that they agreed last weekend but only signed this morning after auba was done and dusted should answer this question.
"Aubameyang definitely solves some problems, namely the goal drought we've been experiencing. "
"We need both of them, tbh, but yeah, Ozil isn't called the Wizard of Oz for nothing. Best #10 of his generation by far. No one is as beautiful on the ball then Mesut Ozil. Some might say Messi is better, but I consider them radically different type of players. Messi is a wrecking ball, while Ozil is James Bond."
Meyang for short? 
I can't believe you've done this...
Sign da thing orny
Sign da thing orny
what yesterday?
"Guess he did too, says he signed last night lol"
"Ssh, yesterday never happened. "
já einu sinni var maður svona rosalega fyndinn og sniðugur
I jerked off reading this.
">  So, so happy.

I can only read this in Pep's voice.

>Ozil though is way more than the icing on the cake. He is the cake.

He's the ~~baker~~ pastry chef

"
"We actually look fluid in attack with him. We seem to finally have a good attack, but we need a new gk and dm to stop leaking goals like crazy."
"Absolutely. Given Aubameyang is more service dependent. Having Ozil who's incredibly creative and world class in creating chances, is now our chance to really start winning games. Provided we end the defensive kerfuffles. "
"We had 5 years to build a team around Ozil, and we failed spectacularly. Not expecting much this time around to be honest."
How exactly does one suck a fuck?
"What he should suck is a long-haul trucker's sweaty, dirty taint. "
BEST SIGNING  IN A LONG TIME!
Mine isn't very social these days but I'll force it in 
"Music to my ears, thank you. :)"
[deleted]
"They tried to beat our offer but couldn't do it. Besides, Ozil didn't want to go work with that cunt Sanchez again."
"We all would of, but its not a shocking twist. Picking the club and fans back up again (Albeit temporally, Probably) is what is needed. Its like Groundhog day, but its time to back the club, even if everyone has a different view on who to blame for recent results."
holy fuck that fits perfectly lol
This is poetry.
Tears of joy!! 😭😭
"Fucking hell man, Mesut Ozil saves the day. I would have literally stopped watching Arsenal play if Ozil had left for United. I would have built a shack in the woods and started making bombs."
"And if you'd like to hear the chant:

https://www.fanchants.com/football-songs/arsenal-chants/weve-got-ozil-mesut-ozil/

Just press play."
We're not getting Zidane. And would we really want him?
"You must have above 5 comment karma to contribute to this subreddit.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Gunners) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
WE'VE GOT OZIL
lol
I’m not joking. He stayed when we were shit. If we manage to pick up he will be one of our greats.
"He deserves all the love he gets, but to be a legend here you gotta win the title, for me at least."
"""with a title"".

Not ""a little""."
"Woke up to the news that we lost yesterday and the prospect of a nerve wracking exam on international trade law tomorrow, and I felt like shit. But out of nowhere, Aubam signs and Ozil's gonna retire at the club. My whole perspective on the days to come has changed for the better. Today is ineed a good day mate!"
This is much needed PR after yesterday’s loss.  I for one will take it. 
Not yet. Have to wait until payday (Friday).
"to this team? of course, ozil it's a face of this team. He dont want to win titles, he dont want to play in january, he play when he want. Arsenal it's Ozil, very talented but coward, indecisive, infantile team. Of course players with a strong character can't play in collective like that."
I would have cried
">“I am a Gunner.”

""Ya Gunners Ya!""

FTFY."
Oh god that would be terribly cringey
But where in their back 9 would he play?
"I feel like we now have a great deal of responsibility. To at least set the team up in the position to have success. Ozil is putting a great deal of faith in us, bearing in mind he can only be a peak footballer for a small window in his life. "
i think it was two things: getting players so he spöt möre runs and wenger staying. i truly think that he would fuck off to another place if wenger had left.
Midfield would be sorted with two really good defensive midfielders. Fabinho & maybe Carvalho?
Bond. Mesut Bond.
"spilled some beer from my mug, it was terrible "
það sem fyndið er að segja
You want me to tell you? 
I don't think your flair is suitable anymore m8
"Where is /u/africanrain, who has been banging on for months about how there's no chance Ozil re-signs?? Show yourself!"

MESUT ÖZIL 
"I know, and I agree with you."
Good luck in your exam bud! You’ll smash it.
"Fuck yeah, any other day and it would be even better. We just signed two great players, added a third really good player a week ago, and could possibly add a fourth before the day is over. I'd say this is the best window we've had in the past five seasons."
"I meant when we first signed hin. I bought that awesome yellow and blue, collared kit."
I would have came
"""I am a gunner"" was the first thing he said in English to the media after moving to Arsenal."
"Hehe! He'd obviously be their keeper, silly fool."
"Exactly, he signed but could easily force a move if nothing happens in the summer. But I think the club has actually set things up to finally take advantage and do the right thing. They're also seeing Arsenal slowly decline and know they could start to lose a lot of money."
"Maybe, who knows. He' got to know Wenger could leave soon, maybe he expects someone better after this or the next season?"
"Do we need two really good defensive midfielders? (Obviously it’d be nice) but realistically would it be better to try and get one really good one? Someone to be a consistent starter I mean. Would we actually start two if we had them? 

But a lot can change during the summer and hopefully we we sort it out. "
Hehe! Not sure why Bond came to mind but it was the best I could do in the moment.
My condolences 
I dropped a full coffee I had just bought this morning. Was devastated. 
Aaah! Feel you man. I hit my toe on the corner of a bookshelf. Worst. day. ever.
Beer in a mug?
Yesterday was a bad luck day for everyone. I stepped in dog Tottenham as I was leaving for dinner.

Hehe! That was beautiful. I was literally envisioning the Unabomber in a hoodie and aviator glasses as I wrote that out.  
Thanks pal!
"Stupid ""fixes"" grind my gears"

"Yes, a quality b2b would be superb business."
"That's devistating, sorry to hear that. I  got a flat tyre on my way to work"
Tequila
"Did you watch the recent mini-series on him? It was really good. Oh yeah, they went into MK-Ultra in the series a little bit. It was much more brutal then they let on.

And this: ""well, you can’t eat your cake and have it too.”"
"I like Ramsey but he runs hot and cold. We need a top quality midfielder, just in case Jack gets injured again. Maitland-Niles is an excellent prospect at the moment but we should still be looking for a world-class defensive midfielder and a quality B2B like you mentioned. I really like Max Meyer but we could still do better then him. He's be an awesome second choice though."
On Netflix? Not yet but it's on my list.
Wherever. I visit two or three free streaming sites that have aa lot of great content.

SHE SAID IT'S FOR THE ARSENAL
Even then grealish seemed to fall the wrong way. I don't know but in the long run it wouldn't have mattered anyway
AND WE WON AT WEMBLEY!

Moms spaghetti
"He's done everything right up until the finishing, good turns etc. It will come, I'm sure."
"We need more of this. Our support and reaction to his performances are what could make or break his career with us. We should be singing his name to get him back his confidence. I know we have Auba now too, but Laca was the type of striker we had been needing to sign for years, and he has many more years in him still."
"Can't wait for him to start banging them in. (: 

COYG!"
A choice between two world-class strikers like Aubameyang and Lacazette is a choice I have been waiting for us to have since we had Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp. 
He's almost there. Just needs to get the right mentality. Will be a huge boost for Europa league of he gets into his rhythm. 
Aaaaaaand he's injured. 
"I don't think people understand how tough that shot was. the keeper covered all angles, including Laca 's favourite shot, between the legs."
"One thing I think him and many players from different leagues have trouble adapting to is just how much public exposure the PL has.

In France, he misses those chances and hardly anyone but avid Ligue 1 watchers hear about it

In England, you do that and the world knows and ridicules you.

Feel that Xhaka has struggled in this regard as well"
"Ppl are odd man, the same ppl saying Mkhi was one of the best players in the league after he was fantastic last week now hate him because he had a poor half on Saturday, we actually played far worse when he came off loool. Fans are fragile"
He's gonna wreck beetroot farmers in the Europa League soon
"If you look at it from a shots missed rather than games without goals it is actually quite interesting. 

From his goal v united to goal  v palace he missed 17 shots in a row.

kane went on a run of 24 without scoring in april.

Difference is confidence, spurs fans get behind him and he gets back in rythm whereas members of our fan base crucify a guy in a new league and team that is struggling as a whole."
"he just needs that confidence, I'm sure he will start banging the goals. "
Lacazette wasn't the reason why we lost that game.....
I wish Iwobi or Xhaka would get the same kind of support instead of personal attacks on social media
Like Henry said at the start of the season it may take time. 
"As fans we are all entitled to an emotional reaction about an event on the pitch, be impossible not to be like that if you love the club, but these grown men in the players Insta/Twitter abusing them is plain childish and wrong, seriously get a life if that is what you are about."
"The whole team was under par against Spurs, and Harry Kane made the difference, our away form is shocking lol"
"This seams to be an annual occurrence. It happens with every signing or big name we have.

The team goes through a rough patch and our big signing or star player (see ozil, Sanchez etc) bear the brunt of the blame.

I'm not saying laccazatte hasn't been poor, but the whole team has been pretty much abysmal so it's not as if he's a standout under performer.

Laccazatte was never a player who was going to transform arsenal and make us less shitty. He was bought as a clinical striker to finish off moves.

Now obviously he hasn't been clinical, but you would expect that from a striker who
A) is lacking in confidence
B) is playing in a team who are shite atm
C) is playing his first season in the prem.

We as fans obviously have the right to criticize and ciritism is vital when needed, but sometimes the best thing to do is get behind a player whos lacking in confidence, especially if he's a new player."
100% behind Laca. The fact that he was in the right position for both those chances is the important thing. Auba did the job of drawing defenders away from him and immediately Laca had two shots. The goals will come. He is a clinical finisher and I expect him to get 25+ goals next season.
i think wenger bringing him off at 70 fucking minutes every game was part of the problem
"Don't get me wrong, I agree that it doesn't help us to throw our players under the bus, but it frustrates me to no end that our £50m striker needs a hug in order to do his job. "
Looking forward to the day when he can crack the top 10 of goal scorers for the season. 
"If he can start banging 'em in in the Europa League games, I think he could win back the grumpy fans fairly quickly. He has a nice opportunity to show good form coming up."
"I'm pretty sure he doesn't read reddit, so there's no reason not to voice my honest opinion about him. I never go after players on Insta or Twitter. That's pointless and stupid."
"yes, my online comments will be the difference, go Laca"
I think he's rather *short of time spent on the field* and thus his confidence dropped. Seriously now once we got Auba he's like instantly benched and before Welbz was chosen before him or he got like 70 minutes per game. Wtf I hope it won't be another Campbell or Perez case.
> French Darren Bent 
"I can't wait until everyone understand his game. In the earlier months when he came in, he made numerous runs behind the defenders but our midfielders couldn't read it and passed sideways instead. Nowadays he rarely did that kind of run but play in between the space instead which is why he couldn't score goals. "
His finishing could have been the difference.......
Couldn’t agree more. He always seems to be working hard to create scoring chances.  
Laca isn't the problem. Wenger is.
Wish we had a song for him. Show him that the fans still believe in him! 
I'm sure the adjustment isn't easy. EPL is it's own breed. People seem to find more reasons to scrutinize him rather than support which is sad. He'll sort it out soon I'll bet. 
"Robbie from AFTV had a great piece on this topic. Laca has come at at a time where Arsenal fans are on edge, and our performances are amongst the worst in Wenger's entire tenure. 

He's a top goal scorer. Big players miss all the time, they go through slumps. I remember people on this very sub getting on top of Cavani. Clearly a top tier goal scorer but he has his rough patches where it looks like he can't hit a barn side. Laca will come good. "
[removed]
Wait - what's this about someone burning his shirt? Did that really happen?  
Can he really work with Auba though? For me he is always going to be second choice and that will hurt his confidence. 
"For a second there, it looks like he has one arm"
"Yeah, I haven't ever understood the hate towards him (at least in this sub and now w/some people burning his kit).

He's out of form, as is a majority of the team hence our abysmal away record and place in the table.  Blame cannot be put on one person, especially anyone ahead of the midfield and defense..."
He shouldn't be a scapegoat he is short on confidence and needs a goal to get form going.  
I’ll still wear his jersey each match day 
This picture makes it look like he doesn't have arms
"United fan here, fancy a straight swap with lukaku by any chance?"
He's playing in our next 2 games (unless Wenger finally decides to Eddie) so should get a chance to get some confidence against a team that we should beat.
"Yup, seeing what Chelsea fans did to Torres (probably price tag added to the pressure aswell cuz he didn't seem like an arrogant guy), we need to show him that we trust him, because if it's the club you are playing for that turns away, then who will he have to support him?"
Change the club motto to: dum iacent calcitrare
Want to see him playing alongside Aubameyang so they can build an understanding together.  We shouldn't be sitting £50M+ players on the bench.
I stand
"Well yeah, he's our only hope to get CL next season so of course we should support him until at least next summer."
"I must take blame and admit that I’ve been unfair on him lately. He deserves more time and thank you reminding me that he’s shown genuine quality at times. 

Hopefully we see him flourish very soon. He has what it takes. "
I truly feel that the Premiere league is a hard league to adapt to and Laca is going through those growing pains.  Expect to see him more at his best next season after one year of EPL under his belt. 
I thought he was missing an arm for a sec
Hell yes...I love this. 
Send him some love on IG. 
Whats that famous quote that symbolises us. Form is temporary but Class is permanent. 
"Bergkamp and Henry both took a while to settle in before they became the legends they are. Not saying Lacazette will get there, but who knows? It's way to early to criticize him this harshly."
"how do we buy a stone cold killer, put him on the bench, and whine when he doesn't score? 

play him!  he'll fucking kill it.  he always has.  I believe in him.  Like jack, ramsey, and welbeck.  unleash them on the world."
Seconded 👍🏻
I'm sure we'll hear way more about him - Peaple will ask if you remmember that he was shity in the begining once he'll fall back into form :) 
Alright which one of you stood on his knee?
Did everyone stand on his knee?
"I can't believe how much shit our ""beloved fans"" give this man. Let me tell you about a man called Henry who failed to score in his first 8 games. "
"“Clinical finisher” 😂😂😭

One of the most wasteful strikers we’ve ever had."
"Fam, I feel the worst for Lacazette.  He get's no service, the same will be true for Aubameyang.  Whenever he makes runs that stretch the defense he never would get a ball over the top.  The only ball that I can remember that was played over the top was Wilshere's to Alexis for a goal.  Then we sign Auba and ice him on the bench last week when that was the game for him to regain his confidence and be on form.  Overall, I've been incredibly disappointed with how he has been deployed because he is a baller."
"Form is temporary, class is permanent boys. We finally got not one but two! top class strikers again, so just relax, drink a beer or two and stop making this a bigger problem than it is. "
Why would any player want to stay with us when he’s in good form if we can’t support them during the bad times
"Until he tells us to all go to hell, I stand by him 110%. We need this man more than he needs us."
Thursday hat trick
"Can someone please send this to his instagram or twitter. The negative will always stand out, but we should al  least try to make him notice this."
I concur . Brother needs our support. If we don't stand by him who will? 
"Fans these days need a dose of 'if you don't like it, don't watch and support'. I'm sick of people analyzing everything so microsopically. Yes, it's sad that we're performing badly. Yes we're in a poor run if form. Yes, we have been tactically shut off these season more often than not. 

If you don't like it, don't buy the ticket, don't buy the Jersey. Stop watching. It's ok to feel disappointed, but attacking players personally has gone too far. 

I'm sure 5 out of 10 people are just average at their jobs. I'm sure 2 out of these has been fired atleast once in life."
I don’t care how he performs bcos I know he is a good player and I can see it even if he doesn’t score. I’m just waiting for the day he proves all his critics wrong. I’m positive the day will come (if Wenger gives him a good chance! Not bring him on at a difficult time!) 
"Thank you! Faith in Gooners restored. He deserves way better treatment than what he has gotten lately. I've even seen pictures of ""supporters"" burning kits with Lacazette on the back. I hope this thread reaches a lot of Gooners and that the fans can lift his spirit in the next games. "
"Wenger should play him every chance he gets, play all your weapons at once. We've already thrown away the league title and Champions League position, can't get any worse than this right now."
"I don't go on Twitter (or reddit) to slag off Laca, but this is ridiculous. He is a professional and it is his job to score goals. He isn't performing well and his job is in jeopardy. It doesn't matter what I do or how I feel.

This idea of, ""hey everyone, let's be extra nice so his confidence doesn't get worse"" is why people make fun of us."
"He hasn't been that bad, tbh. New league, new team. He needs to adapt. He will turn out amazing for us, I have no doubt. After all he is Don LACA-BLOODCLAAT-ZETTE"
It’s batshit crazy to criticize him. It’s his first season. Adjusting to new team and style of play as well as league. He had one bad game. Guy works his ass off and tracks back. Proper fuck off to those that are slandering him. 
"hes commpletely blameless.. Wenger and his tactics which give our strikers next to no service ina decent position.. renders whoevers up there as absolutely pointless Built for midfielders having all the position and no space for the strikers to go one on one with the keeper. 

Top 4's gone. no excuse not to play Laca and Auba together 4-4-2 and give them both gametime "
Fuck any hate this suave bastard gets. I’m buying his shirt TODAY
"He's was a great addition to the squad, and I still think he will reach at least 20 goals in all competitions for us. It's a tall order with the form he's currently in, though luckily form is temporary. "
<3
He is a pretty good striker and frankly what we needed after Van Persie... but he doesn’t get a lot of service everyone is playing around the Box tying to find the perfect pass which doesn’t help him. But he is pretty good at dribbling and holding up the ball(most times) and of Wenger can better manage the squad I am sure he will thrive 
[deleted]
"Legitimately thought this guy didn’t have a left forearm. 
Can you guess I’m not a football person?"
"As a non arsenal fan he finds himself offside too much for my liking. Very clinical but needs to keep his focus more. Against spurs a few times he was on the wings so had a clear view of the back line, and this has happened throughout the season. "
People writing him off are morons. One of our best players lol 
Wenger is trying his way to bring out Lacazette’s form， by playing him from the bench IMO.
"lol
"
"3 months ago when he was on form, he’d have buried those 2 chances in the last 5 mins and we’d be worshipping like a hero. Give the lad another chance."
It is over for him. It is not his fault. But it is over. Wenger and the board have destroyed him by buying aubameyang. 
"I cannot believe Wenger, he stuck by giroud for 10 years and suddenly he doesn't rate laca."
"really hope he goes into the Europa league games and smashes a bunch of goals in, would help so much."
"I'm actually really impressed with the rest of his game and he's done way better than I thought he was capable of at hold up play, as well as dribbling and passing in the final third. Until the Spurs game, it wasn't even his finishing that was the issue, it's actually his movement. He just hasn't gotten open enough. "
"That is why everyone should put trust in him, it’s not like he isn’t capable of anything.

Dzeko’s first season at Roma should be a constant reminder about confidence in a striker."
When he came from Lyon I thought we'd get a classic all-pace striker. Instead he's not as fast but way tidier and more technical than I anticipated.
"> He's done everything right up until the finishing

and yet OP calls him a 'clinical finisher'. doesn't clinical finishing require, you know, finishing?"
"That's actually a good point. He really contributes to team work and really works his ass off. Once he starts finding his rhythm and starts putting away shots, holy shit...."
"Players like Pires would have been run out of the club with fire if he came to the club in today's climate and started the way he did. They say it takes a year for most people to settle...for a reason (because that's often how long it takes). People giving major criticism to Laca for not settling sooner are just kids throwing their toys around. 

 "
"He will come good, he's scored too many goals in the past not to. "
"I think once he hits one decisive goal in a big PL game, he just won’t stop scoring. The thing about scoring droughts is a lot of times all you have to do is break the ice"
"Except his runs too. He makes alot of runs, which is great! But he is just a little too greedy with Them and gets called for offside alot.
Against Spurs I think he was offside 3-4 times and he was subbed in. 
His last run was incredible, when he got past Sánchez. That was just a difficult angle till score from"
"Too bad finishing is what is expected of a striker
"
I’m sorry but over the past 6-8 weeks this just isn’t true. His terrible touches have killed 5-6 attacks a game over that period.
"The piece of shit who burned his jersey didn't help matters, that's for sure. I hope Laca didn't see that bullshit."
"How do we make sure he see's this? more importantly, can we back the entire squad? Maybe a banner could be made with some sort of message resembling something along the lines of ""Back your own, support every Gunner"" (Someone who's a better word smith than I can probably think of something communicating the same message with better wording)"
"Lol reddit has nothing to do with his confidence. I don’t get why people act like trolls on the internet effect players form, fans only react to performances."
"Really like Lacazette, but when did he become world class."
"Adebayor (pre 2009, Eduardo and Rvp wasn't a bad set of strikers to chooss from"
"Lacazette is not world class. He will also lose the spot to Aubameyang, unless wenger tries 4-4-2. "
"fucking hell, the delusion on this sub some times.

Lacazette isn't even close to world class."
"this is satire right? please don't ever demean Henry or Bergkamp by comparing them to laca ever again and I'm not a laca hater. Wenger never chose between Bergkamp or Henry, they played together because BERGKAMP ISN'T A STRIKER."
by what possible metric is Lacazette world class though
"Lacazette?  World class?

Put the crack pipe down dude."
"Lacazette is not world class, and I'd take Wiltord over him, let alone Henry"
"I just hope Wenger doesn't write him off. When he missed that shot, Wenger was seriously distraught looking. Wenger's looked worse for wear for most of the season. I don't think the old boy could handle another season of failure."
"He left a decent amount of space to his right, at the corner Laca aimed at, if it was on target anywhere around that corner it was going in.

It wasn’t a sitter but we paid £50m for someone to make the difference in those moments.

EDIT: Downvote really doesn’t mean disagree."
"The press in England are shit. The Daily Mail just wrote an article about Scholes, Gerrard, Lampard, Owen, Ferdinand, etc. and the 2002 world cup. It was actually a gambling article that turned into an article about the national side in the middle of the piece. These guys were great, but were totally frightened when playing in an England shirt because of the horrible English press and the shit fans. They didn't want the ball, and would play it safe. Some of them didn't even want to get picked to play. Says a lot about the English and their ""Banter"". It's more sadomasochistic then anything. "
"Getting shots is a huge part of being a good striker. It depends to an extent on service, but it also reflects a striker's ability to get into scoring positions. Kane has always had a *huge* shot volume; it's what makes him elite. Lacazette has never had a shot volume on par with Kane, Higuain, Cavani, etc, and his low number of missed shots during his long cold run isn't so much an excuse as an indication of the problem."
We have a different standard of success then Shit does.
At this point in Xhaka and Iwobi's careers with us you regularly would see posts like this. Unfortunately patience works on a timeline and you eventually have to deliver results before people can continue to forgive you and blame the lack of support.
"Agreed, his performance was in no way connected to being brought off. Stupid rotation. Extremely demoralising to not be acknowledged for good performances."
"This isn't Wenger, even at Lyon he was only playing that much."
"He doesn't need a hug, but he doesn't need a bashing either. That's the point."
"Plenty of good players have taken some time to establish themselves in a new league, even some of our former greats... "
50m don't mean shit really. Especially these days.
"I think he'll be alright, he's our default striker in Europa since Auba can't play there due to weird cup-tied rules & Walcott can't hog that spot any more. "
"The same can, and should, be said about our defense and midfield - the reason we lost that match and many other matches."
Idiotic comment
"Your account must be older than 1 day to post here.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Gunners) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
Dunno. Chelsea asked first for a Morata swap.
We're 30+ games into this season...
"Have a day off, mate"
"Agreed. We put him on at the end of the match and he still created the best chances. It's frustrating to see him making these great runs each game and then ignored by his teammates who would rather pass sideways and backwards.

With Auba beside him and Wilshire and Ozil behind him I can see him scoring a hat-full. Imagine if he had started instead of the redundant Xhaka/Elneny combination against Tottenham.

Phillip."
"The problem is I never thought Lacazette was top class. I haven't turned on him recently, I never rated him that highly."
Guess not. 
"He's on 9 now, that's not gonna happen."
"I know he is a professional Premier League striker, but a cross dropping like that for a volley is never an ""easy"" chance anyway. Its medium at best.
Sure, he had little in front of him. I get that. But still, its not an open goal tap in. "
That ain't happening now.
just watch Wenger mess with his mental further by subbing welbeck in last 20 or 30. Wenger has to go
"Completely agree, didn’t expect him to be this well rounded. "
"I said this in another thread but I think it's more appropriate here:

> For the longest time people have been calling him a penalty merchant, ""tapazette"", the ""French Defoe"". And then seeing him week in and week out, I was actually impressed. He runs his socks off when pressing the opposition and chasing loose balls, he's got pretty decent dribbling skills, a really lovely turn, and for a striker, he's got pretty decent ball distribution skills.

> On the flipside though, he's actually slower than I thought he would be. I wasn't expecting Walcott-level pace but something more along the lines of Aguero-like bursts and instead, I've seen him outran and easily outmuscled by even average defenders. Sometimes his workrate works against him too as he tracks back quite a lot and when we do win the ball, he's often deep into our half when you want and expect your striker to be up top ready for the counter instead.

> That being said, I'm definitely still rooting for him to prove everyone here in r/gunners."
"He's a quality player who's come into a team in crisis. He was doing a great job in the first half of the season. Giving up on him anytime soon would be stupid. I still want to see him play with Auba in a 4-4-2. We've got major defensive problems, lets fill as much space on the pitch as we can and make it difficult for teams to get through the midfield."
What was Dzeko's first season at Roma like?
"playing to much FIFA there bro.

Hes a Fox in the box, lovely balance and composure is next to none. don't get me wrong hes not slow just not the pace that mopst people beleive he actialy was. FIFA rating don't know shit. "
Because he normally is. 
"I honestly can't believe it's come to this. I can't believe that we have to write posts like this about out second biggest signing and an incredible striker. 

All this stupid hate has come because we signed Auba and once our cancerous fanbase got another shiny toy, they forgot about the other one that was bought just 6 months ago and someone who is also a 30+ goal a season striker.  

Fuck these fans. "
"I didn't say Reddit, I said fans in general. Like the twat burning the kit. Players are likely to see this stuff online and it would certainly affect their confidence when they already know their performance wasn't great, to see fans reacting so strongly.


And by we the fans, I also meant us in the stadium on game days."
"My ""guideline"" is: ""Can you easily name 5 players in the same position that are clearly better than him"". 

If you find it hard to name five, then that is enough for me. In Laca's case ... well I think we can find five better strikers in the PL alone. (Currently thinking about Kane, Aguero, Salah, Auba, Alexis) "
"He plays on the French national team, that's world class right?"
He's not far off. He put two past Germany with one of the best keepers in the world between the sticks. If Laca gets better chances he'll finish. And we should b providing those chances way more often. At the same time he has to take advantage of these big chances in games when you only get a handful.
"That was more of a gamble as to which one would be fit, but yeah, they were not bad strikers to choose from."
"he plays for arsenal. Mate you've been here long enough, this subreddit has branded Coquelin and Giroud world class. 

'Abandon hope of objectivity, all ye who enter here' - sign outside /r/gunners if it were a physical place in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie"
He is good enough to make the national side of a very good team?
"I don't know, but the people here call Giroud world class so Lacazette has to be as well. "
You shouldn't have been downvoted for this.
" The space was there,  but you needed to be inch prefect. unless he raises the ball off the ground but that's 20/20."
"You're right, there was plenty space for it to go in. But it was still a difficult shot with all that pressure bearing down on Laca. It was the spin that killed it. He should have used his other foot."
"I agree with this for the most part.  I thought it was a difficult shot that he would either have to use the outside of his boot (difficult), his left foot (not really sure he had time), or try to play in Aubamayeng (Really asking a lot to see that run splitting two defenders with an oncoming keeper) - overall you're right though, the difficult shots are why we put 50m for him.  

To me the bigger concern was the volley.  He has shown that he has patience in the box, and he lashed at that when he had time.  That is pretty telling about his confidence level, IMO.  

The greater concern than either specific chance however, is that we just aren't creating enough chances when we play away from Emirates.  "
"But is that not as much a fault of the team? Tottenham are much better at getting the ball into the box for a shot to be taken arsenal barely do that at all. Lacazette is much more particular about when he takes his shots, preferring to pass if its not optimal positioning which is why statistically he is so clinical(lyon days) kane is pretty selfish just shooting whenever, gurantee he doesnt make the assists that laca did v united and liverpool."
"Our strikers since RvP haven't got that many shots. I'm worried we'll see a similar situation with Auba. 

That said it's hard to say wether the lack of them is because service or movement.

I feel we lack a plan to create space for our strikers. How to stretch and move defenses. It mostly comes down to individual performances, which is why Alexis was so important and Özil struggles every now and then.

"
Lacazette is about another 2-3 piss poor weeks away from this.  If he doesn't give us production in Europa League he will be in the dog house.
I'm not sure how bringing on the striker who has been established at the club for many years for the last 20 mins to mix up the tactical approach is demoralising. Especially when you have instantly (and consistently) replaced said striker as starting choice.
No doubt. To be honest he's done decently well in his first few months but when a player like Auba is available for a sensible fee you have to take it. He just needs to work for his place now that he has legitimate competition. The end of that spurs game shows that Wenger isn't opposed to playing one of them out wide too. 
Snap...
Idiotic reply
"He has been poor and people need to stop defending him. He is not immune to criticism.

If this were Iwobi, Welbeck or even Xhaka people would be crucifying them."
"This dude just doesn't stop.  I swear all that he posts is anti-Lacazette shit.

I've tagged him so that I can just easily skip over his posts in game threads and such.  Fickle fans expecting someone to be the best of the best in his first seven months, in a new league, with a new team and style of play."
Still better than what he had previous years 
Boy do I have Something to tell you buddy 
"If only you had a catchy phrase for this idea, then you could start a movement. Maybe #FireArsene? Just spitballing "
"Againt spurs when he missed at the end there, he beat the defenders to the ball from iwobi(?). Maybe he just needed some rest. He only plays for 70 min i know, but he workes very hard during those minutes. "
"Maybe if we try him out on the wing with auba on the middle, his workrate can be fully used at our favor. I think of him as a robben-style of winger who can cut to the middle and score or send a cross to auba

Edit: grammar"
"His pace is sometimes average, other times he beats guys. Not sure why that is, but I think he's speedier then we think, though not quite as fast as we expected. Could be some problems we're unaware of."
Playing two up top won’t fill up space in midfield though

"To be honest I haven't been playing FIFA in the 2015-17 biennium, so that is not completely true. 
Maybe watching too little Ligue 1 yes, but not too much FIFA definitely :D"
he's not even fast in fifa IIRC. like mid 80s? not slow but you aren't just lobbing balls up to him ala Aubameyang
"It's pathetic. We should be happy adding quality players to the squad. There are already morons saying Mkhi isn't good because of one bad game in which Wenger played him out of position. We're not going to become good over night, it's gonna take some time and effort."
"I generally believe players know that fans only care about performances, was all the praise he wasn’t getting in the beginning of the season making him better? I doubt it.

I agree people shouldn’t abuse players but i dont think it really affects form that much. Footballers arent as soft as redditors. Whats affecting hos confidence is Arsene not being fully convinced by him and us replacing him months after signing him.

And that last sentence seems like a sly dig, i was born and raised in Camden bro I’m not a fan moaning from the other side of the world."
"I wouldn't say that Salah or Alexis play in the same position, but I get what you mean"
"5 isn't enough imo 

I'd say 10 easily naming (not when thinking about options) is world class

I still wouldn't say laca is world class but I think he will be one day "
That applies to Giroud too.
Still 3rd choice to Griezmann and the GOAT
"> He plays on the French national team

He doesn't, really.  
He gets very few minutes actually, I've watched every games of the French NT for the last 6 years  
  
Imo he isn't World Class but that's because I only count very few players as World Class but he is a top tier striker.  
"
"3rd choice and has 3 goals in 16 games.

People just need to deal with the fact that he isn't close to world class. 40% of his goals in Ligue 1 came from pens. I was downvoted for saying that last summer since he was the second coming of christ apparently."
no
"I agree he's not far off, if he's not already world class. But I gotta fact check you there, he put two goals past Kevin trapp who is most certainly not one of the best keepers in the world between the sticks. "
"The very title of this post screams ""be nice to him, hes trying! He may very well be a Redditor reading this and we could save his career!""
No. Do your fucking job, Lacazette. Make your money. "
"So is Moussa Sissoko?

That’s the lowest threshold for being world class I’ve ever seen."
A lot of players would qualify as world class. That’s one of the lowest standards of world class I’ve ever seen
so was podolski when all of /r/gunners wanted to sell him. Hell Podolski's team won the world cup so I guess Poldi should get an Emirates statue
"Personally, I'd rather have a Giroud/Auba combination and rotation than Auba/Lacazette. "
What did you expect? In this sub it's like you can't be critical of a guy even though he's been poor for the last month and a half because people said bad shit on his instagram page 
"My understanding is that the causation is double. Some teams are very effective at generating chances (which strikers benefit from) and some strikers are excellent at getting shots off. Lacazette has never been a striker who gets off a lot of shots, though he's been relatively proficient in converting the shots he takes."
"Because there was often no point to it, other than Wenger promising Giroud he'd still get a decent amount of minutes from the bench (and look where that got us - one striker totally short of confidence and one who fucked off to Chelsea). In the early part of the season Lacazette was playing very well and scoring goals but that didn't matter because he was getting taken off at pretty much the exact same time every game. 


If Lacazette had only been taken off after playing poorly and in games where we needed to switch up the tactics then I'd understand the substitutions. But he was taken off literally no matter what the situation in the game. Need a goal? Take Lacazette off. Comfortably winning the game? Take Lacazette off. Lacazette on for his first hat trick? Take Lacazette off. That's got to be demoralising and you could literally see it on on his face. "
"taking him off at 70 says to him ""you havnt done your job and i dont think youre going to for the remainder of the match"". surely, he will be left feeling at least a little bit like that?"
People don't want to accept that our then-record signing has flopped. They'll get over it in time
"Hardly the case though. I like Lacazette a lot, but I absolutely despise the comparative manner to which the fans treat him on here. He has been underwhelming so far and people need to admit it and stop sweeping the reality of the situation under the rug.

1 goal in 13 matches for a striker at a top club is NOT GOOD ENOUGH. It's just not good enough. Nothing more, nothing less. Yet people seem to think Lacazette is completely immune to criticism, just because he is new signing or something. He has been wasteful, slow, made poor decisions and his positioning at times has been dire.

Over the same period of time he has been outscored by both Iwboi and Xhaka yet people are quick to jump on them at any opportunity they can and tear them apart. What irks me further is that people have the absolute audacity on here to blame our other 10 players in the team for Lacazettes shortcomings whilst putting none of the responsibility on him - ""no service :( :( :("" people cry, that hasn't stopped our left back and our center back from outscoring him the past two months though has it? Wake up. He has had plenty of opportunities, the two chances in the last match alone he once again made poor decisions and completely wasted the chances.

I say he hasn't been good enough, because he hasn't been good enough, I say he has been underwhelming so far, because he has been underwhelming so far.

Maybe people on here should start showing Arsenal FC the same undying, unwavering support they show to Alexadre Lacazette,"
Arsenal But Arsene Out n All
"Crap. I didn't really mean he was slow. I meant, he's not as quick as I thought he would be. Poor choice of words for my part. But yeah, he's a team player but what he does to help the team ends up hurting him as a striker when he gets too winded by the 70th minute from all his pressing."
"we're subbing laca off every single game and not starting him every single game, if he still needs rest then we suck at buying athletes"
"Funnily enough, that's actually how he started. I think he was a winger/wide forward up until the 2013/14 season."
"I’d also like to see this. He hasn’t be productive through the middle, and with Auba now we can have him play centrally with Laca our wide. Hopefully that can give Laca better scoring opportunities. 

"
Could be a new wiltord
The 4-4-2 covers more of the pitch then any other formation man. 
"Not to mention the amount of easy chances he missed, the one against Palermo was quite viral back in the days. Last year he was just clinical.

This season he probably doesn’t score as much but he’s playing in a different system"
86. But past FIFA's he's been 89+ and each inform sees him up into the 90s
"Not a dig at all. Was just saying that the fans' reactions throughout any game give the player instant feedback, and every groan puts more pressure on him not to slip up. "
"You are right. I wanted to make a list from only the PL, and I couldn't name five ""pure 9"" players that are clearly better than him ... So I reached out and invalidated my point :) "
"Depends on if you consider the position to be a pure striker or just a forward. Alexis and Salah can definitely be classified as forwards, but I wouldn't say either are strikers."
Sanchez's best season for us was at CF.
Most of the people I know will not be able to name 10 right backs :) 
Giroud is world-class all the way!
France has a top player in every position. I favor them to win the WC tbh
"Yeah for sure, I'm not sure where the line for world class is really. Pretty much any starter in the Premier League is probably fair to call world-class."
He's been getting more chances recently.
Ahh...I was thinking about that when I wrote it and couldn't remember if it was ter Stegen or Trapp or Leno.
"It may be low but it’s a technically correct classification though right? 😄 Good enough to play for your national side in the World Cup. Competing at the ‘World level. France is a strong World side as well so it’s not like he’s first striker for Bolivia or something. 

He wouldn’t make the list for the top 5 players in the World for each position though I agree, but he’s far from a bad choice. I think he’s getting a bit of a bad ride at the moment though. Not given the chance for consistency and then people complain about his inconsistency and lack of confidence. 

Assholes on twitter burning the no9 shirt and telling him to fuck off are cunts and not fans. How can you be a fan and treat any player like that?

"
"shocker, someone on /r/gunners overrates Giroud"
I agree with you.
"I think coming off when you're not performing is worse. Of course the player understands, but they know they are being replaced cause they've been crap. Being swapped for tactical reasons or to rest you is frustrating at worst. Ramsey was subbed the other day after bagging his hat trick. That's not demoralising. Taking him off because he keeps losing the ball would be (just as an example)."
"Giroud is a nice guy and all but in hindsight he kind of disturbed our plans. First we wanted to sell him last summer but couldn't. Then we wanted to loan him to Dortmund but he wouldn't go. So he ended up helping a rival. All the while Wenger has to accommodate a striker who doesn't suit us, at the detriment of a striker who should be part of our long term plans. Another mismanagement by Wenger the not so wise."
"The point being made was that it is regardless of performance. The guy knows when he has done well. So if he's played well, scored goals and he's coming off, he has nothing to be concerned about. 

In actual fact, it's far more common with strikers anyway. If they've done their job early, you can bring them off to rest them and put someone else on who can help hold on to the team.


I get that we don't like that he doesn't play 90 mins very often at all, but when you have options, you want to make use of them. I just can't see this particular aspect of his time with us being demoralising unless it leads to him being benched in consequent games."
How in fuck is he a flop though? He's scored 9 goals already. Our whole side looks dire. By the end of the season he might even equal the tally of our last striker for the past 4 years. You guys sound so fucking dumb.
"You can't even claim a flop when it's been seven months.  FFS.

Such fickle fans."
"It’s true.

People are so reluctant and stubborn to say that Lacazette hasn’t been up to standard so far that their willing to give him their unwavering support despite the fact they don’t give to other players, just because they want to save face for our then record signing."
"Yeah. I've seen people call him slow, especially after Everton when we saw how fast auba is. Just wanted to point out that he looked fresh against spurs."
"Having a hard time understanding the physical demands of the Premier League, Europa League, and cup schedule there pal?"
I don’t really know what you mean by covering more of the pitch. We have 11 players in the pitch regardless. You said 4-4-2 covers pitch and helps our midfield which it doesn’t. 4-4-2 plays with 2 midfielders and 4-3-3 plays with 3. There’s a reason why Wenger loves to play 4-3-3 and that’s because he loves to play through the midfield and outnumber the opponents midfield. That’s why other teams who don’t set up with 3 in the mid against us typically get overrun by us
"True, but his natural position is coming in from the left wing."
"just different ones for different positions

There is a lot more than 5 world class strikers in the world thats for sure"
Lol what.
Yes they're a good team. Maybe I'm missing the point.
"It'll be an interesting world cup, that's for sure. I'd love to see Germany and France go at it in the final. Not sure how the groups are set up though, and whether it's possible or not."
"Dis they sack their manager? Because else I don't know. They drew against fucking Luxemburg, with some of the worst tactics I've seen. "
"not at striker.

Giroud/Lacazette is not an elite strike force I don't care what /r/gunners says"
"My reference line for world-class players is pretty much anyone legible to be starting for Barcelona / Real Madrid.

It's disputable logic but it's quite consistent with reddit's opinions. 
"
"Only during matches were Deschamps tried a lot of new player ( Tolisso, N'Zonzi, Pavard etc.. )"
"What on Earth? By that metric Elneny is world class, it’s an insanely low threshold for the phrase."
That's the dumbest definition ever. That would make Iwobi and Ox world class. 
So Mustafi is world class now?
"He wasn't being removed for tactical reasons or for rest though. He was being removed for no reason other than to give Giroud minutes, it's really obvious. I think you underestimate the impact of being continually subbed off despite performing well. Also consider the impact of being taken off, as the centre forward and chief goalscorer, when the team needs a goal (like against Stoke, Burnley and would have been United if Pogba had got his red 30 seconds later). Being dropped for big away games can't have helped either. "
"well, he was consistently brought off at 70 mins and now weve bought another striker whos taken his starting spot"
"Hooray, he's got less goals in more time than a 32-year old Wayne Rooney. 

Lukaku has 12, and United fans are calling him a flop. Different standards of success, it seems."
"What? People are agreeing he's in a slump. But you don't write off a man like this in the first season, in a down year for the entire club. That's just myopic. Maybe you thought he was going to be Messi and should be re-evaluating your own standards. 

EDIT: I'll be honest, I had him down for at least 20 goals in his first season. Clearly i was way off the mark but I can sit back and reasonably look at the entire picture and say ya, he's slumping but the quality is there and once the rest of this team gets fixed we have a top striker to integrate with it "
having a hard time accepting an arsenal player has objectively been mediocre there pal?
"Have you ever watched a good team use a 4-4-2? A great example of it just happened yesterday with Barcelona vs Getafe. Wenger hasn't used a 4-3-3 until rather recently, and it's more of a 4-2-3-1 then a 4-3-3 anyway. Dude, we haven't really overrun anyone all season long besides fucking Huddersfield and Everton. Other then those two teams we've been getting our ass handed to us all season long.

Even Wenger himself agrees with me on the 4-4-2. You're wrong.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU4SJsOMzuQ&t=20s"
"Of course he is world class. He is in the top three best in the world for his particular skill set. Show me a slow moving aerial platform that can hold the ball up, participate is fast one touch football and score the occasional worldy-and I'll show you Giroud."
"No they still have Deschamps, which means they are gonna win fuck all this summer. Mark my words, they'll crash out before the semis "
I guess you didn't watch the Euros?
"Griezmann?
Mabappe?


"
Mine is top 5-7 in the world at their position.
This could be a good starting point for define World-Class only problem in applying this is that Benzema is the main striker for Real Madrid and well he is far and really far away of being World-Class.
Thanks for the down-vote.
I don’t agree with the above the denifition either but when did Egypt become a very good team? 
There's a big difference between France and fucking Egypt.
"So if we start bringing Laca on for the last 20 mins of every game in place of Auba, does Auba get upset and demoralised?


I respect your opinion, but personally don't see it."
"Yeah, having bought another striker is far more of a concern for him than anything else. That along with fan reactions and the general quality of his performances.


He still has plenty of reason to stay positive though. We sold Giroud to keep Laca, despite Oli's proven record for us. His general play has been good, and his goal tally is not terrible. But going back to the OP, what he really needs is for us to support him and show him we have confidence that he's good enough for us."
"So by this logic, Rooney would come into this Arsenal side and be an upgrade right? See how fucking stupid that sounds? In THIS situation, with what he's been presented with on this Arsenal team, ya...i think I'd give him the benefit of the doubt and say 9 goals so far in his first season where he's clearly been out of form and confidence is pretty good. "
"I'm not writing anyone off. I am saying he should not be immune to criticism and that people are ignoring the reality of the situation. As I said below for a striker at a top club 1 goal in 13 matches is not good enough, not good enough at all. When you're being outscored by the teams center back and left back over the same period that's when you need to start looking at yourself and taking some responsibility instead of blaming the other 10 players for a perceived ""lack of service"" (which doesn't exist by the way, Lacazette has actually had a lot of chances, he is just incredibly wasteful and makes poor decisions.)

I can't believe people have the absolute nerve to create posts like this and stoutly defend Lacazette the way do, yet they are so quick to jump down the throats of Xhaka, Iwobi and others at any opportunity they can. Iwobi has outscored Lacazette these past 13 matches ffs.

I like Lacazette, but he deserves criticism at this time, he's earned it, and just rubbishing off anyone who dares criticize him is just playing ignorant to reality."
"Moving the goalposts now, got it. I agree that he has been mediocre. Your original comment remains ignorant."
"> lets fill as much space on the pitch as we can and make it difficult for teams to get through the midfield.

Your first point is that playing 4-4-2 will make it difficult for teams to get through the midfield, which is just completely false. Just because there's a ""4"" in the middle does not mean there are 4 central midfielders. There are two wide players and two CMs.

You also can't really just throw in a Barcelona example and expect us to be able to just emulate their 4-4-2 tactics with the same success. Different quality teams, different league, different manager."
Why does the player have to be slow?
Oh dear. A striker who couldn't top 16 league goals in a season for us is not (even close to) world class. Even if he can participate in fast one touch football.
what about them
neither apply to lacazette or giroud so i'm glad we're all square here
[I didn't even downvote you...](https://i.gyazo.com/d16d8007be8ec77cc54371284501f6f0.png)
"> Good enough to play for your national side in the World Cup. Competing at the ‘World level.

was the definition itself, he just tacked on that France were a good team afterwards."
"“Good enough to represent your national side at the World Cup, on the world stage”

Even if you don’t take the definition so literally it makes Giroud world class, and anyone else who has ever represented France or a side of similar stature world class. It’s a ludicrous definition."
"There has to be a good reason for th swap, I think that's his point, there wasn't a good reason. It was just to try and keep Oli happy."
"Aubameyang would almost certainly be unhappy at that yeah. Not sure how it would affect his confidence because he seems pretty teflon in that regard, but he wouldn't be happy at all. "
"You don't think Rooney could've scored 10+ goals in Lacazette's position this season? I do. Everton doesn't have a better squad than us. Rooney isn't teed up for tap-ins every ten minutes.

You either think Everton provides better service to their strikers, or you don't understand that 10>9."
"I have never said a bad word about Xhaka or Iwobi. In fact i've said the same I'm saying now. They are being put in positions where it's nigh impossible for them to succeed. Bellerin playing badly for the last year almost and has absolutely no competition for his place. Xhaka was successful in a system that is nothing like the one we run here. That's all down to the manager, and without making a long post, this club is where it is because of bad decisions off the field. Expecting players' performances to flourish in it is hopeful at best. The right manager takes these same players and they will look entirely different, because it's clear to see the talent is there. YOu can't be fan of football and tell me Laca looks like a bust. Sure he's not scoring at the clip we expected but I've been watching this game long enough to see when a striker is bad or just in a slump. It's a dangerous precedent to blame everyone under the sun except the guy putting them out there on the field, especially newer additions to the first team. 

Also your point about the other people scoring is a rubbish one tbh. The ball gets played where it gets played. Those guys are not getting the attention our striker is, or are making runs in behind once the defense shifts away. It's not as though they are taking chances that Laca is getting. I can't see how you can't tell our service to the forwards is horrific. Does he have bad misses this season? Yep...will he continue to miss chances? I doubt it. They will come."
"I love how you've changed your tune suddenly. No mention of being totally wrong here:

 ""I don’t really know what you mean by covering more of the pitch. We have 11 players in the pitch regardless.""

It doesn't work that way, if it did formations would be fairly pointless. A stacked midfield is tough to get through and I wasn't saying we needed to play like Barca, it was Getafe who used their 4-4-2 to effectively shut Barcelona down and frustrate them to no end yesterday. We could do the same thing defensively and it would work will in a quick transition to offensive play with our wingers to our two forwards. Wenger shouldn't have any trouble pulling it off, he used it all the time when he was winning the league.

P.S. - Burnley used a 4-4-2 against City and did a fine job shutting them down for the most part. We should be able to do a better job then Burnley, regardless if they're doing well this season."
"while Giroud does get overhyped on here, I think people are just trolling you. I don't think anyone in this comment chain is actually saying Giroud is world class, although /r/gunners tried repeatedly to make that claim in that past so I don't blame your confusion"
Sorry but you’re just wrong
You don't think they're top players? They would get into every team in the world.
Looks like someone down-voted the both if us because I didn't down-vote you either.
Playing for france giroud is world class. Better record than benzema
I think Giroud is world class. He's been performing consistently for his national side for years. I wasn't being negative towards Giroud. 
"Theo Walcott did more in his first 64 minutes at Everton then he did at Arsenal all season. Do you want him back too? You can’t compare sides with different tactics, personnel, and subtleties. There’s no formula for what happened at your last club working at your new one. So sure, if you think Rooney would’ve been banging in the goals here, hats off to you. "
"I don't understand what you mean by I've suddenly changed my tune lol. Obviously formations matter, but if we're talking about any of the traditional formations (and by traditional I mean not something stupid like a 2-6-2) then all formations cover the pitch. It's not like when you play a 4-4-2 you suddenly fill up the pitch more. Each formation values different aspects of the game and you're bound to leave certain areas a little more exposed depending on what formation you choose.

For example, a traditional 4-4-2 is a little more barren in the midfield. It relies on two attackers up top to link up together while two CMs play as well as 2 wide players. A 4-3-3 (or what others call a 4-2-3-1 now) plays 3 in the middle with one creative CAM. The CAM drops deeper to crowd the midfield. We have one less striker but rely on dominating the midfield to create chances. a 3-5-2 values defensive stability with 3 centre-backs but relies on two athletic wingbacks to support the width that is otherwise lost in such a formation. 

I understand what you're saying tactically, but saying that playing a 4-4-2 will stack our midfield and make us harder to break down is just not right. By playing 2 strikers instead of 1, you're giving up that 1 CAM who creates the extra man in midfield. Yes, Wenger used a variance of the 4-4-2 during his glory days, with Bergkamp and Henry up top most of the time. But unfortunately the freedom of having those two up top stemmed from having a midfield consisting of Vieira and Gilberto. Unfortunately our current midfield options is, you know, just slightly below that level... Having Laca, Auba, Ozil, and Mkhi on the pitch simultaneously will be orgasmic, don't get me wrong I would like to see that as well. But I honestly don't think our defensive stability can handle so many attacking players regardless of our tactical set-up."
"A brief list of players who have topped 16 league goals during Giroud's time at Arsenal:  Lukaku, Mahrez, Dele Alli, Charlie Austin, Sturridge, Yaya Touré, Benteke, Michu. World class striker, that's Giroud."
"griezmann isn't a striker and has been terrible this season, mbappe doesn't start for france and has 1 goal in 10 apps for them. didnt think i needed to enumerate but ok"
"I think the definition of world class should apply only to elite players. We have two world class players at the very most. I think applying it to Giroud is too low a bar, but that’s just me."
"I agree with everything your saying, but i dont see why we can't have those 4 players on the pitch? Auba or laca just need to play on the wing and and we can play our standard 4-3-3. 

Laca has already played on the wing for us and auba seems like he would had every ability too. 
"
"The whole point is that there isn't a barren space on the pitch if played properly. All formations are fluid, hence when a player surges forward another fills in and covers. That's way a 4-4-2 works well against teams like Barca and City, as long as everyone does their job with some degree of concentration. Technically, no formation guarantees anything if the team on the pitch fails to perform. I know we've got weaknesses, no proper wingers, etc. but we can adapt to it and be successful, everyone has to do their job though. And it will offer a better defensive shape while giving us a better offensive break versus the 4-3-3/4-5-1 Wenger used against Spurs.

My point is there are things we haven't tried, personnel we haven't used. We've got some time at the moment, and if we use it wisely, who knows? We adapted last season and got some decent results, we should do it again and see how it turns out. I'd like to see AMN as a midfielder in our Europa match, to gauge how he'll do there. Kola is another option we haven't been utilizing enough, same with the Mavropanos kid."
if Michu got to play against Jenkinson every game he'd definitely be close to breaking Shearer's mark
"Basing an argument like this purely on goals is pathetic. The simple fact is that Giroud’s combination of aerial prowess and hold up play while possessing virtually no mobility at all is basically unmatched. The only other players that come to mind when using that description are Aduriz and Bas Dost. In terms of target forwards, Giroud is at the top, and that to me makes him world class"
"If we're using club football and international together, I agree. "
"hm perhaps. Definitely interesting to see if they'd be able to play as well there. I just personally feel both are out-and-out strikers and it would be a waste for any to play wing. But then again, can't be as much of a waste as sitting on the bench. I'm certain we're all hoping that somehow we can field all 4 together without throwing balance out the window"
"Good point, hadn't thought about it but it is pathetic, even absurd, to rate strikers based on goals. Goals are after all just a minor facet of the game, and incidental to a striker's real job: flick-ons. 

But you might want to reflect on how narrow your category is--so narrow you can barely come up with any other players to fill it. ""Possessing virtually no mobility at all"" isn't a neutral role-descriptor: it's a glaring weakness for a striker. No doubt Giroud is the best low-scoring, stationary striker out there. Just as Ospina is arguably the best of all the flappy, short, spatially challenged goalkeepers out there."
"Laca has played on the wing a few times this season, and with promising results. He didn't start on the wing but he often finished there a few times, or wound up there by circumstances and was pretty impressive."
"Okay, if you wanna argue goals, let’s do it. Glenn Murray is having a pretty great season for Brighton. The €3m signing has knocked in 8 goals for the newly promoted side. Pretty good if you ask me.

8 goals by February in the Premier League is pretty solid for a player of Glenn Murray’s caliber. He shares that tally with a couple other noteworthy players; Alexis Sanchez, Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Heung-Min Son.

Surely, Glenn Murray is on their level? Because goals are all that matter while judging a forward, no?"
"The only striker here is Jesus, who's been injured for over a month. The others are wingers or wide forwards."
All play in an advanced attacking role where goals are expected. Quit dodging facts mate and just admit you’re wrong
"More goals are expected of strikers because they play closest to the goal. This is like, simple stuff."
"Yet, the top goal scorer in a domestic league in Europe has been a striker only twice since the 2007/2008 season. "
How about in the Premier League?
"And look how far you’ve deflected from the original argument. 

If you truly cannot recognize what Giroud has done for club and country during his time in North London you just really don’t know football. I can’t put it any more nicely"
The answer is: you have to go back to 07-08 to find a non-striker in Ronaldo. Giroud has done plenty for club and country. He is a pretty good player and seems like a nice guy. He does not score enough goals to be considered a world-class striker.
"You’re completely missing the point, no point in arguing anymore. Have a nice day."
Cheers.

DAT GUY WELÉ!!!! 
On his first game back after 10 months! GET IN
"I'm fucking shaking.
Danny.
Cech was amazing.
Giroud was phenomenal."
I'm going to suck my dick.
"We should take a moment and recognize that LCFC are the first team in a long time that really deserves our respect after a loss. Yes, the first half was disappointing, but go back and watch Schmeichel with that gritty smile after a barrage of shots and tell me it didn't touch on that core thing that makes you love this sport. "
"This is history, gentlemen. The amount of joy I feel is indescribable. "
True arsenal legend. Thanks LVG.
What a fucking legend
"Welcome back, Danny. Welcome back."
"Last chance. 
Silence. 

WELBECK!

I sank to my knees and started laughing hysterically I am so happy right now thank you Arsenal thank you Danny Welbeck"
"Holy shit. Arsenal just took years off my life, then Welback gave me a few months of that back..."
I need a gif where they celebrate with the fans! And then we need a sidebar picture of it.
Woke up at 6:30 in the morning to watch in America and just woke up all of my roommates screaming I'm so happy
Squealed like a girl with tears in my eyes. What a beautiful moment. 
"I knew Danny would do it, just had a feeling"
Fairytale. We might well be looking back at that goal come May. 
My girlfriend is going to be mad because today Welbeck is my Valentine.
Ran around my house screaming like a banshee. Phenomenal.
"Ozil said something before he assisted Welbz. It's ""Fuck you Barcelona."""
Was watching a stream on my phone on a half filled train into london... just ran and screamed up the aisles didnt I? Ticket inspecters cracking up...
Welbeck better than Pelé ever was if we are being honest.
My coffee table nearly went through my TV I fucking lost it! 
"That goal was coming for about 20 minutes but the boys decided I needed a reminder to take my blood pressure meds. Christ was a game, what a result "
we're in fourth position on r/all right now. the same post from r/soccer is in second.
"Arsenal is red,  
the foxes are blue.  
Welbeck's our hero,  
thank you Man U."
MMMMMMM THOSE TEARS
I'm fucking exhausted. My neighbours must think I've murdered someone. Holy fucking shit what a game 
DANNNNNYYYYYY
[deleted]
Gooooooooooooool! We're winning the league lads!!
Happy Danny day everyone
I'm not sure my dog will get over that sudden screaming all day. 
"He cleared my hangover, fuckin hell"
That will show my lil brother (Chelsea fan) not to come and blatantly tell me: 'you're loosing 1-0'. Like I didn't know. THANK YOU WELE! 
6:30am here. Perfect time for a celebratory pint
Who said big Per had no pace
I think heart rate monitor guy might have died.
Perfect way to make United have an even worse weekend. Seriously shed a tear or 12 
I LOVE YOU ALL!!!
BASED WELÉ!!!
Thank you Manchester United! GOD BLESS DANNY WELBECK
Last time I was this excited watching arsenal was Ramseys winner vs Hull! LETS GO GUNNERSSS!!!! 
"Danny ""Big Dick"" Welbeck"
DAT GUY!!!!! <3
All hail Danny Welbeck. 
"God, my heart is actually hurting right now. So fucking incredible"
also an assist from özil!
im crying. Is it okay that im crying? FUCK IT  IM CRYING
GOD IS GOOD.
I wish I saw Ian Wright's reaction to that goal...
FUCKING GETH IN NGDKNGFdg
"For gods sake, I'd just finished slagging him off!"
A dreamed return!!
Every fan dreams of this!
"Welbeck you absolut hero!

COYG!"
I'm still shaking. I won't be able to sleep for days now.
My body is still literally shaking from the excitement. I can barely type this coz my hands are shaking so much!!
This could very Wel(Beck) be our Aguero moment!
I don't know what to do with all this hype.
DANNY WELBECK BE MY VALENTINE!
I've lost my voice and so worth it!!!
"I think that's what we've missed for the past couple of seasons.  A team that can fight back through adversity and questionable calls and scratch and claw their way to a victory.  I know we were up a man the majority of the second half, but it was still a battle.  I know I absolutely lost my mind when that went in and I'm glad we have something to lose our minds about!  COYG!!!!!"
"I'm still shaking, I actually cannot believe it. I'm so fucking happy for everyone involved in this club and I'm especially proud of the players who really put the grind in for those last 30 minutes. Another assist for Mesut and we reduced Leicester's lead at the top of the table. Still over the fucking moon. #DATGUY"
I don't know what to do with my hands. 
Get absolutely fucked Leicester!!!
"We are so fucking lucky simpson got sent off. Welbeck does so much better in big games prob because he is a winner from his manu days.
 
Ozil was poor today and still with the last kick made a goal with a perfect ball."
I want to up vote this shit 23 times
"Welbeck is perfection.
Edit: Guess r/soccer fans are putting their hate out by means of downvoting others, me included."
HAD TO BE THAT GUY WELBZ 
That's absolute magic. 
"I said to my mum that WELBZ gonna score





She didnt believe me"
"Love the celebration after, sharing it with the fans"
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YE!
DANNY FUCKING WELBECK LETS GO
Welbeck you beautiful beautiful man
O DANNY BOY!!!!
"I have convulsed, had a seizure, died and now I'm alive again. Thank you Danny fucking love"
"I've been shouting and screaming in my small apartment for the better part of the early morning. So frustrating and it seemed like everything was going wrong for us. I was convinced we wouldn't score there at the end. Seriously, it's been the same thing every big game and every season. Then, Welbeck comes back from the dead and makes every Arsenal fan cry with joy. I hope Saint Welbeck can continue scoring these crucial goals when everything seems lost. "
"Fuck Leicester and their fucking fairytale

This guy could have scored the two most important goals for us in the last two seasons. Fucking hero."
GET INNNNN
Danny Welbeck is my goddamn hero
Arsenal can thank Simpson for getting himself sent off and wasilewksi for being shit. 
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY LADS.
I love you dat guy
"DANNY WELBECK, THE DREAM!!"
"I'm having heart palpitations!!!  What an end to the match, COYG!!!"
The things I would do to this man right now...
"Yesssss thank you God, and Danny. "
Take me Danny
Danny Fucking Welbeck!!!
I'm crying so much fuuuckk. Ughhhhhhhh
If we go on to win the title and Welbz doesn't get a statue at the Emirates. We riot.
HERE WE GO. FUCKING YES. DANNY MATE I LOVE YOU
I literally am crying with joy about this. 
WELBECK IS WELL-BACK FUCKING AYEEEE
"How do you guys do this! The match finished a moment ago! 

I mean... **c'mon Danny!**"
Goal of the forever. I love Welbeck so fucking much. 
Legend!
I can't fucking believe that just happened! Thank you Danny Welbeck! Fairy tales ending!
DAT GUY WELBECKKKKKKKKK
FUCKING GET IN WELBECK YOU DELICIOUS CUNT YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Another one 
Lovely delivery from ozil
THEORRY DANNY 'HENRY' WELLCOTT
I just don't know how he does it. Danny Welbeck welcome back my love. Props to Mesut for the perfect free kick and 17th assist of the season!
Lol
Welbeck is the new Wiltord!
He made up the 10 months waiting for him in ten minutes!!
now i have to clean the cum off my underwear but it was worth it though
"TODAAAAAY IS THE GREATEST DAY I'VE EVER KNOWN

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmUZ6nCFNoU"
"Twatkinson can go to Jolly Pirate Donuts and take a 2 hour shit for all I care(if you haven't seen the Tourettes Guy videos, you won't get it)"
Everything pointed to this going in. Wellbeck had been out all season and Ozil had been putting in a lot of poor balls all game. I just knew it was going in 
"I was screaming man, this is what football is all about. What a thin line between misery and ecstasy."
"My dad and I havent been on good terms lately, but seeing this goal, and then hugging him after, :') What a match and what a day!"
Fuckin hell. Dat guy 😎
It's been 4 hours and I am still erect from this. Should I call a doctor?
"I was ten rows back in the lower tier behind the goal when he scored.

Didn't even celebrate, just drank it in. Worth the price of my season ticket, I shit ye not.
"
I've never celebrated a goal like that. Thought my heart would give out. Fucking legend.
I don't think I can breathe after that. 
it had to be
Goosebumps. Seriously I love that fucking guy
"DANNY WELBECK DU DU DU DU!

HE'S THE ONLY ONE I WANNA KNOOOOW!!"
"I clapped my hands so hard they're still numb, don't give a fuck. GET IN"
Can't believe it
DAT GUY
"You beautiful bastard, welcome back "
"Sorry for waking you up neighbors. 
WELBECK YOU ARE A GOD!!!!"
"He deserves it ! What a tough year he has had, and to come in and get the game winner, WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF. "
"First the winner at OT during our FA Cup run, now this, gotta love Dat Guy "
Özil assist too
WELCOME BACK! 
"Does anyone have a version of this with all of our players collectively sprinting after this goal? They were all so happy and energetic.

EDIT: Found one if anyone cares. Don't know why I got downvoted lol. https://streamable.com/0io2"
Fucking unbelievable!
OH MY FUCKING GOD YESSSSSSSS
I'm literally sweating from cheering so much. Fuck me what a finish 
i think i actually ejaculated
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!! GUYS I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEEEEEEE YOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!
I THINK IM HAVING A HEART ATTACK
I woke my neighbours up when it went in. My mum thought I'd ripped open my stitches. We are back in lads!
WHAT A GOAL.... ANOTHER ASSIST FOR OZIL 
This is why football is the greatest sport on Earth. 
"Sanchez and Özil weren't at their usual best today at times, but everyone else pulled up their socks tonight. Olivier played amazingly, he worked hard and was fully aware of players around him creating great opportunities with Theo scoring of one excellent headed pass.

Then Özil pulls out a pearl of a cross straight onto Danny's head.

I hope Danny stays uninjured and continues to grow as a player.

I don't even know how to feel, this sort of thing just doesn't seem to happen for us."
# #7 on r/all!!!
I need one with audio so badly. Pleaseeeee
HGGGGGNNNNNNNNNN
LIKE A NEW SIGNING!!!!!!
Dat guy at it again! Welcome back danny
I fuckjng love you Danny you absolute legend !!!!!
"My United mates were trolling. I just had to play ""Shut up "" by Stormzy to them. And Wele's goal made it even sweeter! "
"i don't i don't i don't , what just happend? it think i blacked out!"
"I was by myself in a packed bar in Newcastle where no one really gave a shit about the game and just ran out the door screaming ""DAT GUUYYYYYYY""...wont be returning there again"
"DAT GUY
DAT GUY <3"
"What a time to be alive.

 Who thinks we should retire Welbeck's shirt when he leaves! 

This is truly^legendary!"
"REQUEST FOR LONGER VIDEO INCLUDING CELEBRATION


DAAAAAAAT GUY"
I want a longer vid with the celebration!! Welcome back Danny you fucking beauty!!
WELE!
[HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW](http://www.toothpastenipple.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/waterboy-nipple-pinch-uhhhh-o.gif)
"Can we just take a moment to appreciate how top class that ball in by Ozil was.

And fuck yeah Danny Welbeck, it's good to see you again!"
I've sold my soul to seven deities. Was worth. 
[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/5AGY8eQ.png)
"God that was good! I may or may not have shadow skeeted the TV screen. What a ""welcome back"" for Danny"
Some say I am still leaping majestically through the air.

"What coquelin did to mahrez was amazing (fucking time wasters)

#ITS DAT GUY WELBECK"
"Letter sat here fist pumping and cheering, luckily didn't wake the neighbourhood."
"Don't forget dat assist, tho."
I wonder how joyous the celebrations were?
This thread is 5th on /r/all right now. And the /r/soccer link is 2nd. Get in Welbeck!
"ITS DAT GUY WELBZ

***ITS DAT GUY WELBZ***

HOOOLLLY SHITT IM IN FUCKING HEAVEN RIGHT NOW AAAAAAAAA"
how did nacho celebrate the goal? Would love to see his expressions after the penalty thing
AMA request for one of the guys in the crowd Welbeck celebrated with 
I switched off the TV to concentrate on something and missed it!! 
Overtime on overtime. I love you Danny. Please love me back
"I'll subscribe for you a million times, danny!"
What is love? 
"WELBS!!! I missed the god damn game, but this is amazing!"
WELE  BABY!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!
"oh man show that celebration at the end of the clip!! if we win the league that was the moment! I called it would Welbek's first touch to score the winner, this is just fine though :) hats off to Mesut for that ball in, thank you so much!"
Let's not forget to appreciate the solid showing from chambers.
"It was deserved. We should have scored earlier, we had so many chances we just missed, the score could have been 3-1 if we wouldn't have missed a lot. "
I've never gone from 6 to midnight quicker than seeing this! 
[removed]
"Such a beautiful goal, woooo! "
At that distance how does a goalie still fail to stop the shot? 
"Special mention to Martin Atkinson for booking him for celebrating with his home fans.  Fucking pillock.  Wouldn't be surprised if he gets sent to ref championship games for the foreseeable - he's worse than Uriah Rennie (google him) - which, by the way, is reeeeeally bad..."
was dancing around my lounge naked screaming wow cool match
Don't Man U need a striker?
I must have watched this 500 times today....probably only halfway through how many times I will watch it today.
"Wele is a beautiful lad, this goal could be the biggest of the season. THERE'S YOUR FAIRY TALE!!!"
I wept... I'm not kidding. I actually cried tears of joy and relief 
"I'm in the US, so the match was on while I was asleep but I taped it. I accidentally went on reddit and saw the score before watching the match but it was still so tense and thrilling. Great match between two great teams. We got a bit lucky but that's how the game goes. Before the red card the match was very even. "
"terrible terrible defending. if welbz missed it, look at sanchez."
"Fuck man, what a feeling! Moment of the season for me by a mile!"
Gird holding Huth back could have made a big difference in the goal 
Unforgettable moment.
"nup, i'm done"
"What a game. What a goal. I'm lying in bed sick as a dog but holy shit I have screamed myself hoarse.  



^I ^still ^hate ^Martin ^Atkinson

Danny the champion of the world!"
Welbeck giving the whole football world a big fuck you.
"Anyone catch the player reaching his hand out to touch the ball?

He caught himself and pulled his hand back in but still found it odd to watch. What was he planning to do, block his own team's goal?"
Thanks for ruining my morning plans of watching the recording. 
"Looked like a pretty clear hand ball in the box there, buddy even pulls it back like ""Naw it didn't just hit me see!"""
I think arsenal will end the season without any cup
Wanted Leicester to win so bad.
Leicester still gonna win the title because you lot will bottle it
[removed]
THERE'S YOUR FAIRYTALE 
Never seen our players celebrate a goal as a team so much damn!
I have watched this at least 20 times just watching different players/crowds' reaction. Those moments of hope and anticipation and then of explosive emotion are the greatest things in football
Fucking hell what a moment in this season. Could well be pivotal. Got tears in my eyes right now.
Goosebumps. 
Peter Drury is such a good commentator
Is there a longer version?  This cuts off at such a good part.
Never seen Ramsey celebrate someone else's goal like that before. That showed me how much this team believes the title is theirs and they are going to grab it.
Motherfuckin Welbeck!!

CHOO CHOO
"I am freaking the fuck out! That was amazing! Oh my goodness, Danny Welbeck is the greatest player in the world today! Unreal! Unreal!"
I ran through my house with tears in my eyes and nearly tripped. :) Great!
DUde...i'm watching it with 3 dogs. I literally started screaming and they don't know what was going on but they got all riled up and we all made noises.  So fucking happy. What a game...entire 94 mins were gripping
Tears and tears of joy... As though we won the league... Dammit welbeck you beast... You made me cry
"Before the free kick was taken, I was saying to myself... These moments make the Prem so exciting. Give us a goal. Dat guy man. Dat guy."
"Dad and his mates were supporting Leicester because they were the underdogs, they gave me stick when Vardy scored the pen. When Danny scored, I ran through the living room screaming with my arsenal jersey on my face, knee slide on the carpet, fucked my knees, but that was absolutely worth it."
[deleted]
"About a month ago, it hit me: When have we last won it in the last few minutes? Well, just done it in the last second. We are gonna go on a run now, just watch!!!

Oh yeah, and it was vs a team that was 5pts clear at the top!"
"this has to be the most upvoted post on r/gunners I can't remember when we last scored a last minute winner, and one this important too"
The bar I was at (at 8am) exploded and I saw grown men run around like an airplane. It was glorious 
I had tears too mate. Amazing what football does
"Football is fucking mental ain't it. There's no logical reason why I should give that much of a shit, but I'm still absolutely buzzing."
Really shows what he has to offer to our title push. He wanted it more than anyone out there those last few minutes.
"I bet you live for explosive moments like this, don't you jihadi?"
Who needs a gal when we have Dat GUY!
"on a different note, who the hell breaks up just 3 days before valentines? must suck man. sorry to hear "
Lol I always love Arsene's old man fists above head celebration. Such glee
YESSSSSSSS I need one.
"how have I never seen this before? haha this is great, especially the Santi - Ozil high 5"
"Oh fuck, this is quality man! I'm nabbing this one mate!"
"New wallpaper for my laptop, thanks!"
I can't believe your username is jack.
"All around phenomenal match. Even if we had drawn, great great match from our squad altogether. The final goal just made it absolutely perfect."
lol
"Read my mind dude. Before the goal their manager flashed on the screen and I was like ""Fuck you!!!..... Actually you're really cool and I like you and your team...."""
"That hand save against Giroud was ridiculous. I know it was a bit of fortune for him to have his hand in just the right place, but it was a strong hand. Mad props to Schmeichel. Like the commentator said after that save, his dad would be proud."
Everyone except Vardy
"First the goal to keep us in the FA cup to go on and win it, now time to win the league!!"
damn waking up 30 mins early for the pregame. i took the extra 30 mins of sleep haha
THERE'S YOUR FAIRYTALE!
welbeck i may be a man but i dont mind having your kids
No! Stay away
"I went with celebratory peanut butter toast, bacon, and coffee"
Leicester can thank Atkinson for thinking riding on someone's back isn't a foul.
"Dont worry, you're not"
"I'm still borderline inconsolably mad he gave Vardy that Pen.

Unbelievable decision.

"
This was beautiful.
Amazing
I think Leicester done well to keep Sanchez quiet but you're right in that he still isn't back to his previous level.
\#6 now
"I started crying of joy when WELBZ nodded it in.
LOVE YOU DANNY"
Baby don't hurt me?
"Your account must be older than 1 day to post here.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Gunners) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
Welbeck deflected it slightly with his head.
I mean don't go on the subreddit if you don't want to be spoiled.
Go on fuck yourself then
you people?
"Something tells me that'll be like the ""That sums it all up!"" Bit of commentary. Great stuff."
"Even Ozil going nuts. He never goes nuts. The most I've ever seen was his goal against Bayern. But this was next level, and for an assist."
One of the security guards going mad is the best.
I thought I was weird for doing this. Looking at all the fans at the exact moment they realized what just happened. 
Giroud can't wait to hug him. 
"my problem with him is he seems to try to overdramatize everything. Its cool for clips like this when something crazy happens, but doing it for 90 minutes is a bit much for me"

"It's a universal language, we all understand and love it."
I had the game recorded. I saw the score before i watched the damn game and i was still yelling and jumping up and down like a fool!
"> He wanted it more than anyone out there those last few minutes

I love what happened but this idea frustrates me more than any other. He didnt want it more, he just happened to head it in the goal, simple as that. "
Our players love the fucking club and it makes me so happy :')
"Wellhey, my girlfriend cheated on me a few days before Christmas and the Man City match. Fucking worth it, I say"
Would want that instead of a half assed Valentine's Day if the breakup was going to be imminent anyway? Just my 2 cents

Arsenallist has the full replay!! Go there everyone!!
"Was from after the United FA cup game when he got the winner, it seems Welbeck loves scoring massive goals haha"
"Go ahead and save it, it's all yours friend :\^)"
I think I have seen this comment directed at him at least a dozen times.
He has been a redditor for ten years.. One of the early ones. 
"Our heart rates,though.
What a way to win 3 points!"
"Yeah, Ranieri is extremely likeable."
"I did say the first half was not great, and I'll admit it was pretty shameless manufacturing of a foul to borrow Robbie Mustoe's line (and it really says something when the commentator siding with Vardy argued his actions were ""clever""), but let's focus on the positive. Because if we focus on the negative then we also have to talk about [Ramsey's playacting.](https://vine.co/v/inEK06xBTxM) I'm a big Arsenal fan that can make laughable defenses of actions but that one was bad. "
"I would have done that, but there's no way I would have made it through the whole game without the Starbucks run I woke up early for."
well you're no fun. Good win!
"I'm just a cranky old man with not much else to live for besides complaining

Hope they keep this up and go on a run, we aren't just in with a chance now, we have almost a full squad to use. For the 1st time this season there are 3-4 people on the bench that can come on and change the game. "
Oh fuck I thought she broke up with u.. I'm so sorry to hear that man.. Been there.. Fuck that cheating bitch.. At least you have arsenal.. She will never leave you.. I know it doesn't matter much but I wish nothing but good stuff ahead in your life.. Cheers from a fellow gooner..

what is up with this cold hearted bitches? doing aright man?
"yeah I know, the original picture is great too!"
"Thanks man, cheers!"
Where is the heart rate monitor guy when you need him?
Disliking Vardy has nothing to do with his actions on the pitch and everything to do with the fact that he's an ignorant racist which everyone seems to ignore because it doesn't fit the fairytale narrative.
"Two rolls, and then got straight back to his feet, by today's standards that is pretty tame."

"I've been a Cubs fan for 37 years and they just won their first World Series in 108 years...so you know, could be worse. Just one signing would have been nice, but I mean, what if we just start winning games?

This just bout sums it up... 
This is literally Ian Wright’s twitter avi. 
So its official Chamberlain is gone wtf! not smart at all! i thought it was just backlash speculation cause of the 4-0. 
we were in CL final the year the Emirates opened
We had 150m to spend when Wenee had to sing thw extension. Ended making a profit. We are being lied to by the club.
no wonder Welbeck's wages are so high.  he doubles as Gunnersaurus
"Yeah, right over the bar"

of course we wouldn't be bidding.  Fucking Wenger.

"Yo Pierre, do you wanna come out here?"
"So after years w/out a great striker (Sorry Giroud), Arsenal will now have 2?"

Oh shit did we do it boys?
I'm erect Robbie.
Cannot believe that no one else wants this player. We are lucky to get him. He is gonna be good. 
Thats a pretty short contract considering his transfer fee.. It means he wont have much resale value
Man makes like 190k a year. And why 1/2 a year?
DiMarzio has now confirmed it on his Twitter.

"We need a CHOO-meter on top of the tier system. One is rating the source and the other measures how likely on a scale to ten how likely the move is. Ridiculous: Yes, but we bought the ticket already with all these rumours."
What happens with Lacazette?
IM HARD 
"4–4-2 could work if Auba joins along with Mhiki. Wilshere in the middle with Xhaka, Ozil as a RW, Mhiki as a LW, with Laca and Auba as the two strikers."
"We're still going to be shit at the back, at least we might be able to out score the opposition. "
Cech is our starter and Ospina is our back up... i’d be worried
Alexis who?
"Where is this guy going to play? I really hope he doesn't put him out on the wing, its a waste of a goal scoring machine with Ozil back, he will just end up ruined. Put him in his natural place, Laca can go out on the wing, hes not contributing at all atm."
Not every transfer month a player like his calibre is available. Yes please be true 
breathing intensifies
If I see that beautiful ornstein face I will explode in me trousers
o shit waddup it’s that boi auba 
would be superhappy if we added a year or two to that so he is locked with us until the end of his prime (evil grin)
Choo choooooooooooooooo
"That's  €10m-a-year NET boys. 

So it's double that. "
its like arsenal and my gf get a sick twist out of teasing me
Can we sign a couple of middies a at least one CB? 
Who starts? Laca or Auba?
"I'll be very happy with Auba and Mhki. Provided we fit them in well, the first 11 will be better even though we lose Sanchez."
I really hope we dont lose Giroud with this deal. I dont have a favorite player on arsenal anymore after RVP but i really enjoyed Giroud and would hope he finish his career here a become a legendary supersub. 
This isn't happening. If it does we must play with 2 strikers 
"*AUBA, AUBA*

how about we agree on a sale price and bring him home.
"I’m really excited about this signing, I’m still trying to suppress my excitement till the club actually announce but I believe he can do great things here and hopefully reignite his partnership with Mkhitaryan"
Oh hell yeah.
I've lost the plot 
Im so fucking hyped but is no one else scared that he comes across as a giant manchild? Hope he gets along better with Wengs and his boys
"Find a formation to fit them both. Myki (if he gets here) on the right, Ozil through the middle. Would be a weird one, but would love to fit all our best players in there."

This transfer window is just like my finals this semester. I just don't care how it ends. I just want it to end.

Ive seen rumours with various rumours with different amounts being bandied about. I wouldnt take hem too seriously. The only talk about ot to come out of Dortmund is to say Wenger was disrespectful to talk about one of their players. 
Cocks out boys
It is very good. But don't we also need a defensive mildfielder and a new tactic so that the team is not too unbalanced ?
I hope this isn't Juan Mata all over again.

Wengers ready to put him right wing back
Is this going to happen? If this actually happens then all is forgiven and I'm back to being Wenger in
"Hot diggity, finally! XD"
Obvious but this would be a wonderful signing. Wouldnt solve our main and long term issue or issues in midfield but if this does happen then it'll help fill the hole sanchez leaves. 
 Is it lit?
Honestly think laca could be done. Seems like he may come to regret this move especially if he doesn’t find his form soon
Perhaps Lacazette will do better as the player off of the bench

€10m = £8.81m. UK's tax rate is 45% so he will earn £16m before tax or around £300k a week.

"#that's 10m Euros NET

#gross figures should be roughly double that, discounted by the exchange rate (EUR/GBP)"
Does anyone know how much he is currently being paid by BvB?
i guess we will get both Auba + Mkh + a bunch of vendors for the same price as 1 united bound alexis.
Wouldn't be agreeing to personal terms if we hadn't. They got pissed about Wenger referencing him in a presser. You think they'd let us talk to him before we agreed a price?

Seriously. I'd be absolutely buzzing if we sign him. Ozil levels of excitement.

And now we have no midfield depth. Lovely. 
"From the people that brought you “1-0 to the Arsenal”...

Laca hasn't proven he's much better than Giroud for me yet.
"I wouldn’t say Laca is great. 

He’s been a disappointment for sure but Wenger never lets him get a full game. 

Auba is a star tho"
He's gone mate :(
I...I think so
"If we get him, I think this length is alright, since he relies a lot on pace. Maybe 4and a half would have been perfect. Either way, I'm guessing the best hope for a good resale would be to China. "
"According to Di Marzio's [earlier update] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/7rarh4/di_marzio_update_on_aubameyang/), it's 3 and a half until June 2021, with an optional extension for another year."
He'll be 32 when it ends and is a player who relies a lot on his insane speed which we all know can drop quickly with age. Seems fine to me.
He'll be 32 at the end of it. The length is better for us than him. I'm sure he would have preferred longer
Half year left this season.
Because it's January
Because it's January
Because January window.
The half would be the rest of this season.
"January purchases usually have half year contracts.

Also if he does so well that in a year and a half he's attracting the likes of RM again, he can make a move much easier. Or use that interest to get a bigger contract.

Basically while players his age usually only get one more massive contract in their careers, by going for a contract on the shorter side he can possibly get a second huge pay packet"

Have to play both. Total waste of talent if not.

"""And my Sanchez!"" - Wenger to Mourinho probably"
but we all knew that Lacazette will be subbed for Giroud.
id call it a fucking disaster because we still don't have anyone to provide service from the midfield. Man I miss Cazorla. That's where we need to be spending 60 million not on another striker IMHO
150k
All deals are Mkhitaryan's. Everyone else is a make-weight.
"Fucking hell that’s a lot. If Özil wants £350k per week to stay, we’d better give it to him now. "
I stand corrected! 
"Rofl no he wont, we couldent even afford to offer that to alexis. "
"I doubt its more than 6-7 millions net, usually its only Bayern who pays closer to 10"
How so?
"Yes, that's usually how it works. It's better to negotiate with the player first so you can figure it if you'd be able to meet their demands before you start haggling extensively with the club."
"are you joking mate?

That's Wengers strat is to talk to the players and get them on board so their club cuts the price and the player gets more money.

That's why Arsenal never sign anybody."
Maybe 3 inches of snow cripples the UK like when we signed arshavin

Watching Girond then 
I like this!!
Or 4-3-3?
"I think we could see a 4-3-3 the rest of the season. Aubameyang on the right but given the freedom to sit high up next to Lacazette. Ozil playing a free role on the left but moving centrally in the attack with kolasinac coming down the wing. with Mkhi coming off the bench into the same role as Ozil. Wilshere and Ramsey playing box-to-box, but Wilshere sitting in deep by Xhaka when out of possession. Bellerin has played much better as a right back than a wing back too. Only problem is the defense and defensive midfielder spot, but thats always been the case.

Cech

Bellerin. Mustafi. Koscielny. Kolasinac

Ramsey. Xhaka. Wilshere

Aubemeyang. Lacazette. Ozil"
"I think 4-2-2-2 would be the best. Same as RB Leipzig.   
&nbsp;  
Cech in goal  
Bellerin-Kos-Mustafi-Kola  
AMN-Jack  
Mkhi-Özil  
Laca-Auba  
&nbsp;  
That's a decent lineup I guess"
I swear to god Wenger please don't ruin them
Goal.
4-3-1-2
"and shitty defense, don't forget that"
Lol no dm to be exact. Even in the past we had song and coq to somehow play that role. 
"After a team of midfielders, we'll now play a midfield of strikers."
"We got enough there.

Just about.

Assuming Maitland-Niles provides a bit of cover."
I could live with this.
I'd be running around naked in the streets if we won 5-4 every time
"Competition with Liverpool fans on who can clench their anuses harder.  

"
"You can see the quality is there though, he's been in a rough patch but his technical ability on the ball looks top class, and we need to give him more service than we have been"
"Agreed, but im pretty unconcerned about him tbh. Hes had a hard job with the way we have been playing. "
That's what he said
we didnt agree anything with dortmund yet tho
"Yeah... Maybe we're saving ourselves in case he regresses alot by that time and then we cant shift him off the wage bill.
Hopefully theres an option to extend another year. I know we had that with santi, didn't pan out well but still."
Oh if thats the case then perfect!
Its just more about resale value.. Either that or getting another year out of a plyer you paid a lot of money for.
Oh shit.
"Yup, Sanchez will get a similar contract with manutd 3 1/2 years"
"Also, in case he declines massively in the next 2.5 years, we are not stuck with his wages for much longer. "
"I mean, the middle isn’t great as we will need to wait till the next window to get a proper CDM, but it’s probably the best we could do unless you want 3 men in the middle, which our roster doesn’t currently allow."
Man City are pretty damp good in defence

That's exactly what we offered to alexis
We actually offered Alexis around £300k per week. We can absolutely afford that.
"We offered a 250-300K contact to Alexis, that's where the cunt Raiola's argument was for towards asking a pay rise for Mkihi.

Also, Laca is already on 200K."
[removed]
apparently the 190k pw is incorrect. My comment was an attempt at joking about us getting Mkh + Auba + the vendors salaries wenger worried so much about in the summer of 2016 for the same weekly price as Alexis reported 500k pw.
This is incorrect. This is why Liverpool got done for tapping up and ended up paying 80m for a bench player. Dortmund are pissed as all hell that's he's leaving. If they could accuse arsenal of talking to their player without their permission they'd do it no question. Arsenal didn't do this.
"Wenger has good french connections. 

This clearly svens transfer. This happened because of him I have no doubt."
I'm fine with this
"Contract lenght = 2021
Wage = 10 mill"
No winger hype
so we are becoming Liverpool MKII? 9 goal matches incoming.
and a shit goalie
Maitland-Niles 
Ah. I see you've played Fifa before
"Lol we’re arsenal fans, we used to heart palpitations "
If we won 5-4 every time I would have one too many heart palpitations to run around naked 
Yup. The man is on an island when we aren't playing well. He can't score goals if he's dropping deep just to get the ball.. 
If we hadn’t they wouldn’t have let us speak with him. Sounds like all we have to do now really is dot the i’s and cross the t’s.
And about 300k a week more 😂

"Think it's widespread without permission tbh. It's far too easy for Club X to have an intermediary talk to an intermediary of agent Y over dinner. Neither person are in the public eye so it's virtually impossible to report on.

Southampton just appear to have shat the bed because they found out about the result of one of these types of meeting and they're tired of Liverpool's shit, understandably.

Realistically there's not much of a reason for 'tapping up' to even be a thing. It doesn't exist in other job markets. Think the football world has pretty much agreed to the reality overall, people will talk off the record anyway, players who want to move will move anyway."
He was for Saints when they bought him. Might have been a refusal to play because Pool tapped him up of course.
"Well its against the rules so a few things in theory. Whether that happens in reality or not is a different question but its just another way for Dortmund to not do business.

Do you think Virgil is honestly worth 80m? Do you think they paid that fee for him because that's what he's worth or because that's what it took because they pissed off the club they were buying from by going around their back?"

Why is Ozil wearing the away kit at the Emirates?  
Let's just shoot for making it to 5th for now.
With his contract signed and his performances he will go down as one of the best Arsenal players of all time 
"He could, without Wenger. "
All the evidence we should have ever needed to know he’d sign is that [this very picture is carved in the side of an Egyptian obelisk](https://imgur.com/kbBnfqC)—it was destiny!
With everything that's been going on it's been hard to really process the news that he's signed but man what great news. I'm really excited to see what this does for the team.

"back to square one, we were at this exact same point when Ozil signed the first time."
We're still wells a way off from challenging for that title in my opinion. A few new faces in the first team are required. We just don't have the spine needed to do that. Here's hoping though. 
Only if we get rid of our manager
We've had over a dozen years to get a good defensive spine and haven't come close. Don't expect Wenger to start now.

I'm on your side though it's a completely semantic argument. A title is a more general term whereas THE title refers only to the league.

"I definitely didn't state it eloquently, but I think what I did was remind people in a really good mood given our performance and transfer business that there are still problems. Supporting a club is an emotional affair, and we've had a rough go recently. At the same time, if one can step back and look at the wider picture, it is apparent that  there have been several false dawns. We signed Ozil and Alexis and proclaimed the end of the banter era-and then proceeded to buy an aging GK and no outfield players in a year we needed reinforcements. It's hard to admit, but we do ourselves a disservice when we ignore the one constant in our recent troubles: the manager.

Further, the optimism that we are somehow going to challenge for the title when the manager has shown no sign of fixing structural and personnel problems that keep us from winning smacks of delusion. Signings don't win titles on their own. A team with a solid plan and the players to execute that plan consistently will win. So far, we might have some good players, but I don't see any structure in the team or willingness to defend."
It was. Let's aim at 4th then. And winning the EL.
"Yes they do. Just google Champions League title in quotation marks and you'll hit a bunch of results. So my explanation is that 'title' has to do with 'league', so since it's Champions *League* it's a title, and since it's FA *Cup*, it's not a title."
"Thinking because it's rare to have the symbol and nomenclature of success mentioned at once. Like the F.A. Cup, itself, is not the title, it's the actual object. In my mind it's like saying Master's Jacket or the Ashes Urn."
"Title is a colloquial term referring to the league, not all-encompassing. "
Won't the 4th CL place drop to 5th in the League in that case?
"I was talking about using the word ""title"" on it's own.  Champions League Title is 3 words.

I don't even disagree with you?  Not sure why you're trying to disprove what I said"
No it's dependent on its context...OP above meant LEAGUE title...it's really as fluid as anyone wants it to be. It's not really formally used in English football to refer to any of the domestic competitions 
"I don't think it does.. I vaguely remember working out various connotations of this last year and coming to the conclusion that we could only get CL football by finishing 4th, regardless of Man United's performance in the EL

But then didn't MU finish 6th last year? Either way, I'm pretty sure 5th doesn't get CL football regardless of other results"

A meaningless thing? Let's analyse that...

Ask any Arsenal fan and they will almost certainly tell you that this has been a disappointing season. There have been many people suggesting that we sack the manager and even protests about him inside the stadium during a match. 

On the other hand, Tottenham have had their best season in living memory. Some facts about their season: 
-Most goals scored in a season since 1987
-Fewest goals conceded in a season since 1906
-Fewest defeats in a season since 1920
-Highest league finish since 1990
-First Golden Boot winner since 1993

They're what Chelsea fans used to be called before they were Leicester fans.
"Why? We've singlehandedly underwritten global peace since WWII. The US has spent massively on defense but it allowed the countries of Europe and Southeast Asia, and later the former Soviet occupied territories, to recover from the war without having to worry about diverting huge resources toward their own national defense. The relative stability of a single global hegemony comes with a price, but it also has awarded us considerable sway in foreign affairs. Is the budget bloated by inefficiencies and pork? Of course. But is it fundamentally too high? You'll be hard pressed to read any geopolitical analyst on any end of the political spectrum that believes the world would have been better off from the US returning to its isolationist roots during the last 60 years."

It's not closed completely. Money mostly comes in through sponsors then mostly goes out through staff and player wages i think.
Better banter

Yea. The stat is wrong. They've spent 293 over th last 3 years. Come down to a little less than 100 a year 
"I would argue that underwriting global peace is a secondary benefit to the vast military exports the US makes each year. War is a business and the US are the market makers at the moment. They weren't in the past, and won't be in the future. But there's always a dominant player.

however i didn't pay enough attention and cuba is probably not the direct next one above so yeah it is pretty random he's right!"
"I'd guess they've just done it by calendar year.

So far this summer they've spent £151m on defensive signings (Mendy, Walker, Ederson and Danilo), but Stones and Bravo were signed last August, so in the space of one year (August 2016 to July 2017) they've spent just over £200m."
"Also there is a difference between a negative peace, a lack of violence against injustice because of fear, and a positive peace, caused by justice."
"Hahaha that's an absurd and completely uninformed argument with a neat little bow of comically stereotypical bullshit. 

Our 2017 budget for foreign military financing is $5.7B... less than 1% of the defense budget of $589B. The total sales of arms to foreign countries was, according to a slew of reports back in 2014 and I'm too lazy to try and approximate what that number was more recently (it's not as readily compiled since it includes private sales) you're talking about $32B... still well under 10% of the annual defense budget. So ""I would argue"" that you should spend more time having even a basic understanding of what you're talking about instead of coming up with clever sounding quotes to make you sound intelligent. "
"The USA spends 3% of its GDP on defense spending. The USA governments as a country spends nearly 25 trillion in total. The federal government alone spends nearly
4 trillion. The defense spending is not nearly as large as it seems. The USA spends 1% more of what it makes on defense than the U.K. And France. It just makes a lot of money"

GaussWanker has it spot on. 
"What would you call the Cold War then? We spent massive amounts of money over multiple decades propping up foreign governments and limiting armed conflict to local proxy wars vs. a third world war, to stop the spread of an authoritarian imperialist regime, of which Stalin alone is estimated to have directly killed around 20 million people (not counting the massive famines caused by the egregious mismanagement of occupied territories' food supplies). "
"The military and defence spending accounted for upwards of 9% of the country's GDP during periods of the 20th century. That's the point I was looking to make, although I looked into it and it's much lower now.

Exports isn't just weaponry by the way, there is a vast amount of trade performed which includes technology, hardware, logistics and human resourcing too. "
"Shhhhh let's not alarm them with facts

EDIT: I misread your initial comment. Our government expenditures in 2016 were $3.54 Trillion, not $25 trillion. Our GDP in 2016 was $18.6 trillion. That said, your point is correct. We spend a proportionate amount of our gross output on defense. "
But unlike France and the U.K we fail to care for our poor and less fortunate 
Alright daddy calm it 
A club will also get much bigger kit deals and sponsorship deals if they're able to sell more kits.
"Oh yeah it's definitely a cherry picked stat, but it's being used in a jokey context. No one is making any effort to seriously perpetuate the idea that City spend £200m a season on defenders/keepers."
"Haha yeah, I can see why america would want to [limit authoritarian imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_authoritarian_regimes_supported_by_the_United_States). Limiting the Cold War to proxy wars when the alternative is a nuclear holocaust is the kind of ""lack of violence against injustice because of fear"" that I mentioned. You know what proxy wars are to the people living in those countries? Still wars.

I'm no fan of Stalinism, of the USSR, but I doubt any figure given without a source."
Clearly you were *excited* to say that
"I'm actually gutted. I'm going to miss this beautiful bastard and seeing him in a Chelsea shirt is heartbreaking, but he's been an excellent servant to this club. Could never dislike this man no matter where he goes."
"Out of all the departures in recent years, this one saddens me the most. Walcott was a longer standing player and one of my favorites, but his use to the team was clearning waning. But Giroud, he has been with us and been loyal to us for so long now that this really stings. The fact of the matter is that he still could have been useful for us, but I understand the necessity of this move, especially for him. Still hurts tho :( Thanks for the memories Olivier, I will continue to wear your kit proudly"
Giroud in blue makes me blue.
"Came in after RVP left.

Would never be as good as RVP but he fight on and became a fan favourite.

Na na na na Giroud will be missed

"
I love you Giroud.
I'm crying
"He took a lot of criticism over his tenure with the Club, he had big shoes to fill (RVP) and although he didn't win us a title, he was pretty damn good and will remain one of my favorite Arsenal players. Also, I like that Chelsea paid the most ever for a 31+year old player. COYG"
Genuinely upset by this.
I wanted him to go somewhere we could continue to support him. But I just can’t do that if he’s playing for Chelsea. 
Fuck I’m so sad
I am really really sad. Can’t believe this has happened. Good luck Ollie!!
Heartbreaking 😔
"What a day of mixed emotions!

Thanks Giroud, we'll miss you!"
"I’m so disappointed to see him leave, we’ve got a shrinking squad now, oxlade-chamberlain, Gabriel, coquelin all left without being replaced. You could say that Sanchez was replaced by mkhi and aubameyang is a theo/giroud replacement. Overall our squad has less options for rotation and players to come off the bench. For all his (often valid) criticisms, we’ve lost a match winner. I’m not expecting Danny welbeck to match girouds scoring record any time soon. "
"Fuck, I'm sad now :(

But.. I should be happy because Ozil signed a new contract and we signed Auba.

But... I should be sad because Sanchez left too.

Conflicting emotions :("
"Feels bad, man"
"Goodbye, you beautiful man. Thanks for everything that you've given us. "
"This hurts more than Alexis

The thing is he was loyal to the club unlike Alexis, also he has been a great servant to the club. Thanks for the memories you sexy beast."
"This one hurts. Giroud has been such a great player for us over the years. Minimal drama, always got the job done, only to be sold off to the competition after a miserable final game. "
"Watching in Chelsea colors makes me sick. Hope he leaves them in 18 months for a more decent club and does well there. He can help Chelsea beat Tottenham, Liverpool and United though, but pls lose the other games agent Giroud."
"He was a great player for us and I feel that we will miss him desperately. I know Laca and Auba are more skilled players, but Giroud delivered for us time and time again. I hate that we sold him to a rival, I feel we could watch him lift a major trophy in blue and that saddens me.   "
This might truly be the end of the banter era. You will be greatly missed Oli
"I'm not crying.
You're crying."
I hope we sing for him when Chelsea next play us. 
C L A S S
"He'll get such a deserving and warm welcome when we meet next season. 

We're gonna miss you, ya sexy French bastard."
"He's there only for the game time, nothing more. "
"Good luck to him.

Of all the recent players leaving I don't think any make me sadder than this one. It was the right thing for everyone involved but Giroud was a big sexy, classy bastard and I'll miss him.

He made a lot of appearances for us and scored a lot of goals. Hopefully he will be remembered favourably even though he was around at a time full of frustration."
"This is so sad, I really can't bear the thought of him playing for them. When RVP left at least we were able to hate him but Giroud's always been so likeable and professional. The thought of him playing for Chelsea is just wrong."
Even the media team realise this is a big loss. This and the tribute on the website are way more heartfelt than most. 
A couple of years ago I never thought I'd be this sad about him leaving.
"Love the man. Always professional, scored some worldies while playing for us (mostly with the NT though). Thank you for everything Oli, we'll miss you."
So happy I wore my giroud kit yesterday for his last game but so sad I’ll never be able to celebrate a giroud goal in it anymore.
"Goddamn you Chelsea, why couldn't you keep your grubby Russian mitts off of him?  He was gonna go to Dortmund. I could have cheered him on at Dortmund...."
"If I ever see a snake emoji next to this guy’s name I’m kicking off.

Hero."
My heart is broken. Ollie was everything the club needed and more than it deserved during his time here 
NAAAAAA NAAA NAAA NANANANAAAAAA 😢 
My flair :(
Man I loved Giroud. His ability to link play was so good. I feel terrible about this. 
I'm fucking crushed. One of my favorite players to ever wear the shirt. It's gonna tear me up every time I see him wearing that blue kit. 
"You came, won my heart, become my favorite player over the likes of Dirty Sanchez and Ozil. YOU scored, we sang. Your pace, we laughed but you still was my number 1. Stay classy, I will secretly cheer for you but not for that team. Enjoy"
"One thing that I always love about him is that he celebrate goals with so much passion. Even if it's not him who scored, he'll always be there and sometimes give the goal scorer with a huge warm hug that makes me want to be hugged by him as well. "
"Im gutted.

First gunners game i went to was Arsenal vs Crystal Palace on January 1. 2017. Gonna miss this beutiful bearded bastard!"
"NO, you've got something in YOUR eye 😭"
Farewell [Oli G. Booyakasha!](https://i.imgur.com/b5KTanF.jpg)
Man this sucks. But he deserves regular playing time. So long you beautiful French bastard. 
gutted.
"I'll miss his meaty, French forehead. "
I think I just died inside
"Giroud never backed down from a challenge. He fought for his position constantly, and gave everything he had for this club. Always respected him and his professionalism... damn, I will miss him. 

...and to think of the service Cesc will be able to send his way... 

Oy. "
n^o^o^o^:-(
I miss you already Olivier.
"Guess I'm in the minority here but while I'm upset he's left I'm happy for him it was to a big club like Chelsea with a great manager. If anyone's earned it, he has. Never complained, never talked badly about the club or the manager, always gave his all. Was far better than many gave him credit for. Gonna miss the guy and hope he does well there. A true professional. "
"I'd rather keep Giroud or move him to a non-rival team than have Aubameyang. There, I said it. I'm not even gonna comment on the criminal fee we let him go for."
"I'm fucking gutted. I loved his big clumsy ass but he was low-key amazing! Man this hurts alot, ugh not many players like him, replaced rvp. Remember the summer he came and everybody was waiting for his transfer and you could see Koscielny becoming closer with him before the move. Scoring against Bayern and Milan. Being a don against Tottenham, his Wilshire and rosicky goals omg I'm fucking crying. He was the first arsenal transfer I truly loved."
"I just wanna take a moment to recognize everything he has given me.
Rest easy, my sweet flair"
Dammit I hate seeing him at fucking Chelsea but I guess this is what he wanted. A lot like the Cech situation I suppose. 
"This is actual sad news, gonna be hard to watch him play in the blue color. But I can understand his move. And tbh didn't the deal with Auba went thourgh because Olie signed to Shitsea so they could let Bats sign for Dortmund? Circle is round again."
"For some reason, this hurts more than the alexis loss... "
Can't believe Welbeck outlasted him
Farewell you beautiful lamp post
I'm gonna miss this beautiful man. One of my favorites and its gonns hurt seeing him in blue but thanks for everything Ollie. Love you.
I’m so upset. What a wierd day. Emotional roller coaster. 
"I'm gutted he's leaving I'll miss Ollie with his unique blend of power, strength and well let's face pure sexiness.
Thanks for the memories mate including that assists in the 2017 FA Cup Final. "
https://youtu.be/HMuv1Z_kCUY
[removed]
Who put onions in here?? :'(
I have such mixed emotions today.
"I am going to miss Olivier so much. Given the doubts that people had when he arrived and the massive shoes he had to fill, what he achieved here is really impressive. 

Merci beaucoup mon cheri "
I am sad.
Said to see the most beautiful man go to Chelski... I have a feeling he's going to be lethal there tho... 
"The guy played hurt for us all the time and still gave it his all. Gave us a ton of fantastic moments. Sad to see him go, but also happy to see him get paid and play."
"Fuck, this actually is making me depressed. "
"Most handsome Gunner of all time (Sorry Alexis, you never even came close)."
"As far as corporate thanks messages go, could have been a lot worse. "
"So fucking sad at this exit. Those last minute strikes, the headers and the assists. Man, I will surely miss this guy at Arsenal :("
:(
"Good luck. Thanks for the memories!

https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/922538003054120967"
Everyone is leaving. :( This feels so wrong. Good luck you big beautiful beast. 
I just don't know how I feel after what has happened in the past 36 hours.
"Guess will never see that Giroud/Mkhitarian Scorpion rapid fire :(

But seriously I’ll miss Giroud more than any other player since I’ve started supporting this club. Cheers to the beautiful man that makes us all question our sexuality."
I will never fap again ever :-(
me cherie <3
"Genuine question: Why is it sad that Giroud is leaving but Arsenal fans met Oxlade-Chamberlain’s transfer with pitchforks?

Not being even arrogant. Will any of the fan base be bitter towards this? Since it’s a London rival as well. "
Oh God I think I'm gonna cry
"Damn shame. He has been wonderful for us. Thanks for playing for us, though."
"I'm incredibly sad about this.  I didn't feel much when Alexis left, but Giroud leaving has left me with a void in my chest.  Something constant is now gone."
I'm gonna miss that handsome fuck.
What do I tell my wife?
wont be suprised when he starts banging in the goals for chelsea and everyone who agrees with this deal starts having a go at Wenger.
Our squad just got significantly less sexy 😢
selling to a rival is the lowest of the low
Love you Oli!
Fuck this hurts so bad. I’m still a relatively “new” fan compared to some of you lifers. I started following in the summer of 2012. My earliest Arsenal memories are selling RVP and buying Giroud. I️’m gonna miss him 😢
Handsome Bastard GBNF 
"I'm pretty sad I'm not going to hear ""meaty forehead"" when watching an Arsenal game anymore :("
"thank you for everything you sexy Frenchman

We'll all miss you Oli G 

#NaNaNaNaa"
Okay in second thought IM BLOODY FUMING. WELBECK STAYS HERE BUT GIROUD GOES OH GOD. 
The one time Chelsea succeed in buying class 🙁 
"After going to a game in 2016 after coming over from Australia there was a young man with Down syndrome sitting near me hurling abuse the Home game directed at Wenger. 

It included saying his time was up & that he was a better manager than Wenger, Now I actually believe him....."
"Oh man, this is more sad to read than Sanchez.. Really."
Going to miss you scorpo!
Waiting for the tears to drop
"What a beautiful beautiful man, going to miss him"
[removed]
"The king of the late strike, I'll miss you Ollie. "
[removed]
My favourites at arsenal. A legendary cult hero in my mind 
"Man, really unfortunate. I feel he'll do really good there though and he'll take the starting spot in no time. "
"Why? damn...he iis my favorite type of footballer, what he lacked in technical abilities he compensated with work and he iproved with every passing season, was amazing watching his evolution for a player i intially thought was going to be Van Persie replacement and slowly adapt. When he was 23 years olution is amazing. His first touch is definitely world class. Selling to chealsea of all clubs has left me gutted. I have much more to say, but i better not to. I'm very angry over the way such a loyal hard working servant of the club was booted to a rival.

I'm very happy to see in the end most supporters remember Giroud for the good memories and not the long scoreless runs. He didn't deserved more criticism than the rest of the squad at many of those moments.
"
Impossible to dislike.  Underrated and didn’t get proper chance.  Never got his 4 4 2.  Going to be brutal when he scores on us.  He’s going to own our CBs 
"Best target man you can have. I love you, and you will be missed. "
"Unlike RVP, this feels understandable, scored match winners on PES 17 for me as well, thanks for everything!"
"I fucking hate this team. No other club in the world sponsors their rivals like this. How does he get to choose to stay in London? For his wife? He wasnt as concerned with her when he was fucking prostitutes a year ago. 

Fuck. Are there only 3 clubs in the world? Why do we only sell to EPL top four teams? I hate Wenger and the board and our shit players. Watching Giroud play was a bright light in the mountain of shit that has been this decade as an Arsenal fan. I hate this fucking team"
Why the fuck we sold him to a fucking Chelsea?
I wish he stayed and Lacazette went to Chelsea. Very sad about this.
Why does Giroud have to leave & wenger stays. Can't we trade wenger???
This thread is fucking nauseating lol 
....so wheres he going
"Same. Always felt he offered something to the team that no one else did. From giving away his kit during that league cup match, to the numerous clutch goals, to the big smile he always had on his face. I'll miss him a lot. True gooner. I'm glad my away kit has his number on it. "
"he's the one guy Arsenal could build a statute for and I'd be okay with it.

he always gave 100% even when he was benched. "
"Farewell, my Prince Charming. [Thank you for the memories] (https://m.imgur.com/a/doWt9)"
"It's not his fault he's going to them. You think this is really what he wants? No way. He was moments away from signing for Everton over the summer, and he didn't because he loves playing for Arsenal. And we repaid him by pushing him farther down the pecking order. If this is what he has to do for playing time and for his international career, than good for him; I hope he gets what he needs. I want him to be happy and to continue to be successful, even though Chelsea wouldn't deserve him in a million years. He'll always be one of my favourites. "
Please let’s not boo him when he plays us. 
"you had me until 'stings', then I remembered that a scorpion stings, then I got sad all over again."
"In some way, he sacrificed himself for the club. His move to Chelsea allowed us to sign Auba. He's a true hero in my eyes."
"I mean as fans, how can you hate this man who is more loyal to the club than his own wife"
Also makes me BLEUgh
"Though ironically, that was the color of the last Arsenal shirt he wore.
"
Imagine the pain for us Chelsea fans having to see cech in red haha 
He's a s battler. He can go down a bit but he is. 
Yep
Same. Told myself I wouldn't cry. I failed. 
Aren't we all?
"I'll be happy for him to score in every game, as long as the result is always a 4-1 loss"
There's the world cup this summer!
I will always support him as a person and a player. I will **never** support Chelsea. 
"yep I would have been a fan for life but not fucking Chelsea. Sadly for all of us, Giroud is probably the best striker Chelsea have ever had outside of prime Drogba and they may not have Ozil but overall they have better service than Arsenal."
"Feel the same. No hard feelings toward him whatsoever, and I hope he performs well (but his team does shit)."
Debuchy's exit also hurts for a bellerin rotation 
Couldn't give a fuck about Sanchez but this makes me depressed 
"> Hope he leaves them in 18 months for a more decent club

Ideally, he comes back. He would still be useful as a supersub."
"Fuck 18 months. If he had a good World Cup, I hope PSG pick him up or even MLS. Let's just wish his spell with the Chavs will only be a short one. "
"Mate we lost to Swansea last night, it's definitely not the end."
I would say signings like Giroud are what helped get us out of the banter era.
We are literally all crying. 
You're right that jerk off solution with santi :(
This is the only thing that's made me smile today.

"Imagine what Chelsea fans felt when Cech signed for us. Its a similar situation, a seasoned pro not willing to relocate his family but wanting to continue his professional aspirations. 

Sanchez was a better player but fans are sadder to see Oli go which says a lot about him and his stint at the club. We helped him establish himself in the French NT and he has scored countless beautiful goals for us."
"Without pain, joy wouldn't feel so good my friend. This club knows suffering all too well."
He had a choice between joining Dortmund on loan for about 4 months or joining Chelsea. He chose the latter. Not our fault. 
I love Giroud but Aubameyang is a massive upgrade. Yes 18m is a bit shit but I guess you can't put a price to Chelsea sending a readymade replacement to BvB. It's just too bad Giroud couldn't go himself. It's hard but if this was the only option the club made the right decision...
"If you wanted him to reject Chelsea then third choice at Arsenal was his only option.

He didn't want Dortmund and others weren't in.


There have been worse transfers."
I agree. We used to keep players and make them legends. Now we just sell to the highest bidder regardless if they were a rival or not. I can't get attached to any player because we might sell them at any moment. 
"Then stop supporting arsenal, you sound like a real shit fan"
Bruh this isn’t RVP he’s literally our third choice striker. You should be happy Chelsea has to resort to buying our castoffs
There's no chance he gets booed. Hell we'll likely sing for him next season when they play here. 
"Some fans booed Ox, I felt bad when he still came over to clap to the fans after that. Ox was never toxic to us.

Now obviously Giroud is more popular but it may still happen."
"It's been a long time since guys like Terry, guys like Adams. Guys who were career Gunners. Career Blues. It's tough to see some of them play elsewhere. Enjoy him, and be kind to him. He deserves it"
"You on the wrong side of the tracks, son. Fuck off back to your own sub."
Costa?
Lol costa was way better than giroud what the fuck
"> Giroud is probably the best striker Chelsea have ever had outside of prime Drogba

Jimmy Greaves? Gianfranco Zola? Eidur Gudjohnsen?

Lol, he's nowhere near the best striker Chelsea have ever had. I'm wondering when you first began watching football, lol..."
Agreed. 
"Yeah, I wonder what the rotation option will be? Maybe chambers/holding if we stick to 4 at the back. AMN if it’s three I guess, we’ve got enough cover for left back with Monreal and kolasinac. "
Shanchez' departure was a relief
A£€XI$
Why are you depressed about losing our third choice striker to a rival but not depressed about losing our best player to a rival?
I highly doubt that would happen 
"Hey you know what they always say, Attack is the best form of defence... "
But not for Dortmund obviously....
Giroud was loyal and actually cared about the club and played with heart. Alexis was good when wanted to be but had no loyalty. 
"Cech is way better than giroud, played longer than giroud and won way more than giroud so no it’s not comparable "
What’s up with the aggression man? No need for that fucking hell
"Shevchenko, Crespo, That Romanian drug addict..."
Must have been this year because even Costa was better. 
"Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Nicholas Anelka. "
"Good on him, why shouldn't he get paid?"
Recency bias. For some reason people forget everything Sanchez did for us after 10 bad weeks but dont remember how poor Giroud was for long stretches. 
"One of them gave their all every moment of every game for 5 years, even when they made mistakes and even when they lost. He went to a rival purely as a necessity to himself and as a favour to us. The other gave full effort when it suited him, and demanded to be played every moment of every game only for his own benefit, even if it was detrimental to the team. He was a constant source of conflict and unrest in the team, and after openly disrespecting our team, forced himself into a move away for money and personal glory, without half a thought to the team dealt with him met every demand that they were able to in the time that he was there. "
He loves Arsenal. He's made that very clear over the last 5 years. I wouldn't be surprised at all. 
Something about his wife not wanting to leave London
Don't pay too much attention to him. :)
"Come on, Giroud for Arsenal was better than Shevchenko was for Chelsea. "
"Translation; Likeable medicority vs abrasive excellence.


Alexis did more for us on the pitch than Giroud ever did and I'll miss him way more for it. At the end of the day they both left for rivals, Giroud could have gone to Dortmund but chose Chelsea instead. "
No but how often do we bring back old players :P
"True, Shevchenko was mostly there for the cash by that point."
"I know, but Oli is extra special. "
I would ofc love to have him back
"Also, we have brought back Flamini and, for a brief time, Henry. We seem to be partial to bringing back our Frenchies, so there's still hope. "

You lost at pool and your mum gave me lifts home after the pub. And naturally, as life went on, we saw each other less. 

But don't worry mate. If you do pull through, we are going to spend some time together. You'll meet my daughter. I want you to teach her how to shoot people in the head online. 

If you don't, I don't know how I'm even going to find out. I guess I'll just stop seeing reposts from Reddit on Facebook two hours later. I just want you to know that in my heart, Arsenal will still be 4th.

That was amazing.  Thank you for sharing and allowing us in to something so personal.  You have a very real love for the club - it's obvious- and I'm glad you shared your perspective especially regarding the days before Wenger and the torturous 1-0 matches.

So this is Reddit. Wholy Fuck lol well you have gotten me to write my first post. No being an Arsenal fan I have always respected their intent to play. They have has some amazing squads and should have won the Champions League in the only final they were a part of. However I fully intend to be watching the end of the season with you laughing as neither of our sides finish in the top 4 and kicking your ass at Fantasy Football next season. Love you brother. 
Your love for Arsenal on the precipice of death makes me feel ashamed of my own apathy over the past ~~few months~~ few years. I won't let the disillusionment get to me and try my best to stand by my club. 
Thats awful to hear mate. I really hope you fucking beat it.

">some of those 1-0  victories were torture

You got that right, but at least the team showed fight and scrapped it out and often snatched those wins from far superior sides (v Parma in 1994 CWC final always springs to mind). I wish the current team had some of that steel. 

My sympathies to your current situation, and my best wishes and good luck to you for the future."

I just found myself questioning every post I've ever made on here.
"And come to which conclusion? That they should accept underachievement since they aren't dying of cancer? 

We all operate within the context of our lives. Sure, if I contracted cancer, the performance of the club would probably drop on my priorities list. That doesn't mean I shouldn't still want us to improve.

Very few things really matter in the grand scheme when our lives are at risk, of course, but I still want this club to improve. And it would probably have been nice for the team to have been in a better situation for OP if this is indeed his last season. 

Good luck OP, it's a sad thing that life has dealt you. I hope very much that you get through it, and if not, we will all join you someday, wherever that is. "

Why are you so defensive? Has someone hurt you? You're talking like I wanted to be your personal savior when all I did was approach it from a rational angle. Why don't you try just reading a comment as a comment before being a dickhead to someone next time?

"Was most impressed by that big touch that he was able to race up to and reach, he's got some pace. Great instincts in the box for his age, want to see him continue to develop and hopefully get some minutes - especially if we can tie up Europa qualification in the next round maybe in the ensuing rounds he can get some games."

For Giroud, it was months before he scored for Arsenal, Eddie took seconds."
The thing about Arsenal is they always try to walk it in.
"I like, your use of punctuation."
...our next game is against Palace you know that right?
You're right Chris. 
With Theo gone hopefully this opens up more opportunity for him

Why can't we just give some praise without hanging another player out?

Best TV series I have ever watched. Too realistic tbh. 
Season 4 was just unbelievable. The show was so good throughout but it just exploded with life at that point. It definitely became a little bit more Hollywood in some ways but it gained so much in plot and character that it didn't matter. Man what a show.
Omar comin.
My amn... well done 
"If you think ignoring religion equates to greater intellect you are seriously mislead. There are many amazing things to be found in religion and especially Christianity, the stories that are found in the bible still hold use in today's world and for the future. Many of the greatest minds in history were christian, for example Blaise Pascal and Thomas Aquinas, which together form some of the most amazing speculations that have ever been presented in philosophy."
I thought it was about gervinho till i realized you're a bot! Wait.. why am i talking to a bot?
Cue*
Typo. My bad. 
just pray that no other club targetting him
Because it's a zero sum game. Eddie doesn't get a chance with Giroud fit. There are only so many places in the squad.
"No one. cares,"
", in the world."
I remember watching him debut as a kid and being so excited at those comments... And then I watched the rest of his time with us.
" > Too realistic tbh


Can confirm - live in Baltimore, MD.  The majority of the shit you see on that show really fucking happened."
What show? 
Fuckin Prez man. I went through the same thing of teaching in a super rough school and seemingly being out of my depth. I relished his little victories and felt every bit of pain he did for those kids. Shit was heavy 
"Not saying anything about intellect. But if it religion that keeps him focused and motivated (nothing to do with intellect) thats good for him, as it is definitely better than being motivated by money.

Not saying that this is true for all religious footballers at all"

Unfortunately, it has come back 19 years later and is now at stage 4 and spread to my spine.  We're both going to beat the battles we are fighting, because that's what we do. We're Arsenal fans.

"I've been disappointed by Arsenal as a team and fanbase for most of the season. And haven't watched quite a few games , just because I thought it wasn't fun.

United fan checking in. Get well fast mate 😘
This update made my day.
This is BY FAR the greatest news I'll get today! Congrats on the good news man! Keep on rocking in the free world brother!
Keep pushing. Focus on today and tomorrow and enjoying whatever comfort you can. Such great news this is. Continuing to send as many good vibes as I can from Idaho.
What fantastic news! 
"Congratulations man! It's also heart warming to know your wife is beside you, indulging in the banter as well! 

Also, hope you enjoy watching Dennis Bergkamp's show reel today.... and also the title winning goal by the other birthday boy Sylvian WILTOOOOOOOOORD at Old Trafford!

"Congrats man, that's awesome news. I hope you don't mind but this is probably as good a opportunity as any to plug Anthony Nolan...

Anthony Nolan are a charity that have a register of people willing to donate stem cells to those with blood cancers (either directly from the bone marrow in your pelvis or via a method that only involves taking some blood). You can sign up to this register if you're between the ages of 16-30. Men are particularly sought-after because they are able to donate more stem cells and so are more likely to be chosen as a donor. You can sign up for the register via the website, here:

www.anthonynolan.org/8-ways-you-could-save-life/donate-your-stem-cells

I donated stem cells a few years ago and it was one of the best things I've ever done. The charity is full of amazing staff and volunteers and they cover any expenses, if that would stop you. Also, contrary to popular belief, donating doesn't have to be painful. If you choose the method where the stem cells are taken from your blood, it's just like donating blood. They just have to give you some medication (GCSF) beforehand to stimulate stem cell production.

If you're unable to sign up, you can always donate some money instead! 

TL;DR - Click on the link to sign up to the Anthony Nolan Register if you're between the age 16-30. You could help someone, like OP, in need of a stem cell transplant.

I'm really happy to know that your getting this good news and I can only imagine what you went though and what you and your family are feeling in both good and bad news. I'm really happy to know that the tumours are not growing and some are going away, that's incredible.

"Love hearing this, brings you back down to earth, being born in the 90s means we grew up with possibly one of the greatest arsenal teams of all time haha but there's still magic about being in a cup final, it's sad that a competition like should lose value to fans! Can't wait for it!"
"Thank you brother.

I just remember being 1 of like 3 Arsenal fans in my year at primary school...everyone was either Man Utd (majority) Liverpool or Tottenham.

I don't blame young gooners for being frustrated with the current situation, as they don't have our frame of reference (boring boring 1-0 wins, Bruce Rioch, etc). But thinking just getting rid of Wenger will rectify everything is naive in my opinion. Liverpool and Man Utd have shown that it's more complicated than that.

I just feel fans need to understand, Wenger in or Wenger out, Arsenal will still have issues, mainly a board that don't care about pushing Arsenal to the top so we can hang with the likes of Barca/Real/Bayern. 

Kronke however sees us as a healthy part of his investment portfolio. 

He doesn't need to bleed Arsenal, I would just like a board who are competent and give a crap, and an owner who is willing to REALLY invest and push us on. 

The likes of Kronke snr, Kronke jnr, Sir Chips, Ivan Gazidis and Dick Law need to go...in my humble opinion...that would be a good start to restructuring.

"was also going to comment on diet. Scientist have done a lot of research on glucose and how cancer feeds on it. My girlfriend, stage 4 breast cancer, sticks pretty closely to a ketogenic diet because of this. There's plenty of reading to do on the topic. Highly recommend educating yourself, because most cancer doctors skip this very important factor.

Skip the fruit, eat avocados, almonds, grass fed butter (kerry gold), and fatty meats from known sources (make friends with a farmer that practices organic and/or pasture raised ranching). Depending on your location there's probably coops for meat of various sorts. We pick up stuff from a central location monthly."

Heresy! "
Football. Ffs.
"Here you are, dragging me into talking on this sub, right after I said don't. Well, I think the post has gone quiet now, let's get the Wenger tinder box lit.

I can't remember ever not being Arsenal. There was no moment of choosing, or a special player, or any reason at all that I can recollect. From as far back as I can remember, this was my club. My mates were all Arsenal, I don't even know which came first, the friendships or who we supported.

It's different now. First I can really remember was the season Don Howe resigned, and we weren't good. Little did we know the young guys making their debuts like Rocky and Keown would go on to be the legends they are. Everybody was still hanging on to the glories of the [5 minute final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQEXjVWe6lA) (before my time, but always worth a watch) and the '71 team before that. We hadn't won a league title in 15 years, we'd only won three since WWII. Skip forward and Arsene Wenger went and won it three times in six seasons! A double double and all. Think about that for a moment.

Nowadays, I turn on a podcast and hear a US accent talking, or come on Reddit and see NY Gooners, or Nigerian supporters clubs, it's still kind of amazing to me. Arsenal was a grand old club, but nobody supported us because we were good. You supported the Arsenal because that's where you were from, or because your dad told you to. My family moved around and I ended up in the South West of England right around the time Spurs were getting trendy for their cavalier game and [this sort of hilarious nonsense on the side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KEMMfV5-Qg). At the time I couldn't get my head around these farmer's boys talking about supporting Spurs and giving me shit for being Arsenal when they'd never even been to the far side of Bristol, let alone the other end of the M4.

But now look at what this club is, a standard bearer for how football should be played, known and loved around the globe. There's fans on the other side of the planet getting up at 3am to watch every game we play and spending two months salary just to visit London and go on the fucking stadium tour. Hats off boys, I live an hour away and I can't compete with that. And why has all this happened? Why are we not still propping up the stands at Highbury and talking about dominating the 1930s, Anfield '89 and how the '71 team was our greatest ever? Does anybody think it's because of our progressive board, the recklessly competitive nature of the Bracewell-Smiths and the Hill-Woods in their hereditary ownership of our club, or all those billions that have been ploughed into transforming it?

No. It's not. And we all know it. And that's why every time somebody complains about Arsene Wenger and they go too far, the words catch in their throat. You can't do it, you can't make yourself forget everything that he's done for you, even when you're angry. A part of every one of us can't let go of the things he achieved on our behalf, and many of us wouldn't even be here were it not for him. He's responsible for some of your most cherished and lasting childhood memories, just like he blew away the incredible years under George Graham for me, and wiped away the shame he brought us in the end.

And this is where we are. We were a grand old club before Arsene came, with a way of doing things and a set of values that George and co let slip. Arsene restored all that, restored the pride, and then took the club to heights it hadn't known before. And when he goes, I'm not sure who's values we're going to be defined by. Maybe that's irrelevant in modern football, maybe it's all just financial ledgers and transient fans now. But I think we'd all like somebody to come along and say those words Rocky said, and mean it, because that was real.

I'm an older bloke by comparison to Reddit's average, but I'm not in my 60s or anything. Yet the world has moved on fast, people expect more than ever and it's all so binary. Either we're incredible, or we're awful. Either we're jubilant, or we're miserable. And the curse of choosing to support a successful club is that it can only get worse, you can't enjoy the little things because you've already gorged yourself on the history defining victories before you've learned to love the club for what it really is. This is probably the greatest time in Arsenal's history, and it's probably over. I doubt I'll ever see us play like we did or achieve what we have again. We might win the league a few more times, but I can't see us dominating again in my lifetime. Do Manchester City or Chelsea really dominate with all of their resources? More than a quarter of a century has gone by since Liverpool last won the league, if you'd tried to tell anybody that at the end of 80s they wouldn't have believed you. Success is short lived and expensive now.

And I agree with you ea3y, I don't blame younger fans for their frustrations, things aren't great and this whole online cauldron of emotions is totally normal now. It's not just football, this is how everything is perceived. It's all under the microscope, every facet of people's lives is constantly being updated and always on their minds. I'm not immune to it, I became a web developer in the last century, I was among the pioneers of online communities and I've taken part as the Internet entered into people's minds and changed how they think and act. I'm pretty concerned about my own kid growing up being influenced by so much raw emotion always in their pocket, ready to affect how they feel in any given moment of boredom. I'm not even sure I want them to be a football fan.

And yes, it's time for Arsene to pack it in. Maybe this summer, maybe let him have another go. I'm not ambivalent about it or anything, but we're not going to suddenly transform ourselves again the day he walks out, more likely we'll sink a bit before we bob back up again. It will probably take a lot more than a new manager and a bit of overnight restructuring. I don't think anybody there currently has the appetite for it. I'm at peace with that, we've still got things to play for and a cup final at the end of the month. Plenty of football fans would snatch your hand off for that kind of failure, and if anybody feels the need to abuse each other over whether this is or isn't enough, I just wonder why you waste your energy on football? Go and do something that brings you pleasure instead. If Arsenal only brings you a sense of camaraderie and enjoyment when it's all going well, perhaps it's not really the game that you love after all.

Take it easy ea3y, count yourself lucky that you got to live through this era of Arsenal, I wouldn't swap it with any other. I hope anybody who might read this got something out of my perspective, but I wrote it mostly for you, because I picture you and your wife and your cancer all sitting around bored as can be in a hospital room. My little girl kept us all in hospitals for a long time and I know how dull it can be. If you're actually sat in the garden sinking cold beers already, don't tell me."

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Orny. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love."
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
"Confidence level's hitting about 75% for me

It's the hope that kills you"
Chances of BVB securing a replacement?
I was just casually f5-ing. Didn't expect this late night spicy rendezvous.
ORNSTEIN YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN!
At this point he really should have his own goddamn tier.

"Good.

Please make sure we don't have a repeat of the Lemar situation. If we get that, I'll understand why City were so upset with our incompetence. 

Looks like I could be revising my view of nutless monkeys being able to do Gazidis' job, who knew?"
Please for the love of god find a replacement dortmund
#HE HAS BROKEN THE SILENCE!

The biggest part of this is dortmund have to find a replacement. What actually happens if they don’t?
"Liverpool fans are getting angry, saying their management is worse the ours and that we shouldn't complain since it looks like we're getting Auba. I can't disagree right now. Selling Coutinho in January is madness, that guy is what made them so dangerous. The City win was an anomaly, their defense is still a shambles even after spending $75m pounds on VVD. I think we've got a good chance of rising up the table in the coming weeks."
"If Ornstein ever tells me that I'm gay. I'll be like, damn, I must be gay."
ITS FUCKING HAPPENING
"Just sat down and put on Netflix, poured myself a double and figured let me check Reddit real quick before I watch something. Amazing start to the evening! "
"If this doesn't go through, I'm going to blame Jen Giroud for not wanting to move to Germany."
"So this means that the deal will not finish until BVB can get a replacement. 

Edit: so apparently, it's being bandied about, this means Giroud will leave, potentially to Chelsea. If it is a sale, it would be in the £35m region. How do we feel about that?"
My man Arsene had to pick up the phone himself hadn't he
ALL HAIL!
YASSSSS ORNACLE!!
HAPPENING: IT’S
"They are looking at steve modeste as a replacement if the giroud move doesn't come to fruition.

top 3 targets for BVB - 
Giroud
Zapata from sampdoria
and modeste from a chinese team i think. "
"Let's hope he still comes to us, bit worried if it's down to them getting a replacement or not. Seems like they want him gone though and got what they asked for now. "
"I just want to see how the hell Wenger intends to fit Lacazette, Özil, Mkhitaryan, and Aubameyang on the field together.

But goddammit if he does and it works..."
"Nothing better than seeing Ornstein's face along with ""Arsenal close to..."" on Reddit 😍"
Its a shame Giroud prob going to go this window hes a loyal player and for what we paid for him hes record is pretty good.
PRAISE BE!!
Choo choo
I love this man.
I CAN REST EASY NOW
FUUUUUUUCKKKK! We're actually gonna get him! PLEASE DON'T FUCK THIS UP SOMEHOW!!!
"Oh what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day. I may just reinstall FM on the laptop now. Feeling hot for this squad

"
YES ORNY BABY IM SO CLOSE 
I wish they wanted Welbeck instead of Giroud. 
I'm at full mast now
"Alexis who?? Unreservedly forgotten about him, haven't we! Kind of glad he's gone. We can now focus on getting Auba + Miki intergrated into the team. Ozil signing an extension. Wilshere having a solid run in mid-field. Come summer, find a Santi replacement + better keeper + CB (don't think Evans is going to cut it) and we should be set. Also hoping for a TOP 4 finish. PRaise the loooardy!"
PORN STEIN!!!!!

PORNSTEIN 😰😰😰😰😰
"And we have our official club statement as to why we didn't sign Aubameyang - BVB weren't able to line up a suitable replacement. 
"
It's true!!!!
Is there no chance of offloading Welbeck to them as a sweetener to get this done?
"It's no secret that we all love Oli, but sometimes sacrifices need to be made."
Just take Welbz and get over with it.
"Top 4 and Aub signing will make up for the horrible season, get it done Gazidis!"
Give them Danny instead and we got a deal.
Has Ornstein ever been wrong?
"David fucking Ornstein you spectacular bastard, you know exactly what to say to get me going"

I WILL NAME MY FIRSTBORN DAVID ORNSTEIN
LET'S FUCKING GO LADS. BVB GET ON THAT SIGNING ASAP
The elation to open the sub to this post
"I PLANNED ON NOFAP FEBRUARY. LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE WAITING UNTIL MARCH LADS. I LOVE YOU ALL, THOSE TWO SENTENCES AREN’T CORRELATED! 🤤🤤🤤 "
"No wait, so if they don't get a replacement then the deal doesn't go through & that will be because we took such a long time?"
"Anyone a little sad that we are throwing out Oli for a temperamental Auba? Oli has given great service to the club, and is genuinely one of our most likeable players. Would be extremely sad for him to go.

"There is no God, but Ornstein, and Twitter is his messenger."
[MRW](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JHS7po8pGz94TgQ/giphy.gif) I've been spending the last couple days reading rumours from iffy sources/outlets and starting to lose faith but then the god orny comes through with good news.
"Story of my life, always some unsettling caveat!"
That's some pleasant news for Arsenal.
Hopefully they can find a player fast 
If this happens that BvB link up will be fresh
My pants can't handle the pressure!
"Hail Orny, full of grace, the transfer news be with thee. "
"Dont see why Giroud isn't interested in this deal - he'll go from second/third choice striker, to starting for a top quality team like Dortmund. Gives him valuable gametime going into the World Cup in the summer, plus increases his value/potential suitors (if he wishes to push for a move later). It really is a no brainer win-win for all parties involved (except me. cos I love Giroud). "
"All we need now is to get rid of Welbz, give Nelson the fringe minutes to develop (so we can sell to Man City), and buy a decent DM or CB. "
Now instead of looking for Aubameyang Arsenal transfer news i'll be looking at Borussia Dortmund transfer news in hopes that they get their damn replacement soon.
"Can someone explain to me how it's a good idea to sign a striker that puts Laca on the bench and Giroud out of the club when we have gaping holes in practically every other position bar CAM?

Do any of you genuinely believe either Laca or Auba will stay at the club for more than a year if they are on the bench? What is the point. It just screams panic buy- unless it's a change in formation to follow."
Give them welbeck.

"Before people go with 

""ARSENAL SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM WEEKS""

Dortmund have been looking at replacements for weeks. The couple of million we were negotiating with wasn't going to make much difference in who they bring in as a replacement. Also, should remember with Dortmund being on the stock market, it's possible they wanted to hold news of his deal until they had it all worked out. "

"So let me get this straight. We fucked around with low-ball offers for weeks only to end up paying their full (and completely reasonable) asking price. As if this is not embarrassing enough, the deal can very well stall because they don't have enough time to find a replacement. \#JustArsenalThings"
I knew this all along. We're not gonna get this deal done in time. It's already Jan 29 and now Dortmund need to sign a replacement first. How the fuck is that gonna happen when it took us 25 days to just agree on the fee. Gazidiz is fuckin cheap
The Plug broke it first 2 hours ago. 
"Should have got him about 2/3 years ago when first linked with him. Papering over the cracks, meh."
This tweet is Arsenal putting the ball back in Dortmund's court. It doesn't really mean anything.
So give them Lacazette and £10M.
We didn’t get a replacement for Alexis in summer...
Just spend the f%$£**g money german-Wengz!
Dortmund ends up signing Yaya Sanogo as their replacement 
It’s the same team just given more freedom.
Maybe Batshit from Chelsea.
Modeste also a possibility
would be funny if BVB stole Dzeko and Giroud didn't move - Conte would be fuming!
Modeste is a definate possibility. His former coach at Cologne is now the coach of BVB and reportedly they've kept being in touch with each other and he wants back in the BuLi.
"Hopefully Danny ""pele"" Welbeck"
Give them Giroud and say bb to EL.
I'm note entirely sure Giroud is the answer for either parties. Giroud is cup tied--so he's useless for Dortmund in the Europa League. Aubameyang is cup tied so he's useless for us in the Europa League. My gut is they are looking elsewhere.
"> Danny Welbeck is available.

Out of loop: what's with David Ornstein meme? Saw his Twitter replies with similar said about him
Would you guys please stop with this shit?
What a fucking comment lol. Legendary.
You get gilded and all the upvotes in the world for this and yet when I say I want to fuck Özil's eyes out of their sockets I get downvoted to hell. I hate this place!
Sit yourself down. Let's actually go though
You can't hold it back anymore
Hopefully Dortmund are much better at getting deals wrapped up swifter than we do. But I'm with you. I've been burnt too many times!
Modeste is a definate possibility. His former coach at Cologne is now the coach of BVB and reportedly they've kept being in touch with each other and he wants back in the BuLi.
God tier. 
"Yeah, give him Tier 0 or something"
I'd believe him over the official site.
Get me off Wenger's wild ride
Essentially the only reason why I could see this deal carrying out til completion once everyone's happy.
"Yo Pierre you wanna come out here? 
- every Arsenal fan"
i was partial to the john cross as saddam one right above it
"Exactly. We’re in the same position city was in. They’ve got enough money surely to secure a sign in though. 

Edit: oh wait so did we"
Tbf we get to also see how it's like to wait until the very late and then bitch and moan because the club didn't get a replacement in time. Funny how no one blamed City in that transfer yet they will blame us if this falls through.
"We don’t really have the right to be upset about that IMO, because there’s no obligation for them to sell. Personally I’d offer them Giroud as the replacement though. "
"We're still awful at negotiating. As expected we're going to pay the 60m they were asking for, and we tried to haggle for a week which may very well cost us the transfer in the end. If we came 2 weeks ago with what they asked for they'd have found a replacement easily and Aubameyang would have already played for us.

We still end up looking like idiots, no matter the outcome."
I feel like we all need to tweet them Anthony Modeste https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTM3D-SVIxg 
Welbeck would be my preference. 
That's actually neat man!
Then we dont get Auba lol.
"I think they will still sell, I dont see them keeping Auba after everything that has happened in the past couple of months."
Liverpool have the same problem as us. It’s no good having incredible defenders if you have a manager who sets up to leave them exposed. 
vvd has played 1 game?
Damn good evening!!
"As a fan of the Edmonton Oilers alongside Arsenal, player's wives and their desired living arrangements are the bane of my existence."
"Giroud is twice the man Auba will ever be, I'd rather keep him and let Aubameyang be toxic in some other team."
"Would rather give them Welbeck. 35 mil is decent enough for Giroud - but we have to remember his hold-up play is almost second to none, he would do well with any team. "
I would rather it be a loan.
"Right but if Arsenal are confident enough to leak this news to Orny after nearly a week of silence, then that’s encouraging. Dortmund have plenty of money and a few days to nail their end down so things look pretty good. Being an Arsenal fan though that means crossing all the fingers and toes."
I highly doubt well decline a sale to Everton just to allow a sale to Chelsea 
"Sadly, Giroud would be third striker after Auba and Laca. At this point he has more value than someone like Welbeck. I'd be happy to see him go if playing time means a lot to him and if it paves the way for Auba. "
"Absolutely do not want Giroud at a shit club like Chelsea. If he had to stay in London he should at least go to Palace or West Ham.

Selling Giroud for £35m is good business though. I'd love for him to stay at the club as back up but if he wants a starting spot and we get 30-35m for him that's fantastic. If he went to Chelsea it would be similar to the Cech move a few years ago. Loyal club player, wants to stay in London, pushed out by younger/better players."
"Sure sell him, I'd rather him convince his wife to move to Dortmund though. "
2nd coming of the fappening
"Well if all the funds you give to BVB will be allocated for a replacement, then I think it's still going to happen. Either way though Dortmund are a selling team, so chances are it will likely happen. Besides the way Wenger is performing he's going to need Auba if he wants a contract extension. 

Arsenal's now trying to win League cups instead of FA cups..."
Don't forget Jack hes got more heart the all those put together.
"“...collapse.”

Still, if Ornstein says it...must be good. "
Under his eye.
I honestly think Welbeck would fit their system better than Oli too but oh well.

I knew my 220th F5 would do me good 
Might not be him. He has a wife doesn’t he? Maybe she likes London. 
Because it's fucking Auba! 
It's obviously a change in formation. Try to relax and give Wenger and the team some time to experiment. 
"Why would Laca have to be on a bench. Play a 4-3-3/4-1-2-3 with:

Laca - Auba - Mkh

Wilshere - Ozil

Elneny 

Nacho - Mustafi - Kos - Bellerin

Cech

Rambo and Xhaka can rotate in for Wilshere, Mkh, or Elneny, depending on the opposition. "
"Dat gaping hole doe. Yeah it's very Wengerish to sign an attacking player opportunistically. I wonder if he'll try to put Laca on the wing. Honestly, we need a CM or two and a CB wayy more than a striker but I guess if we can outgun teams the structural issues in defense and lack of cover in key positions can wait till summer?"
"German media are reporting a deal that is €63m rising to €70m. Dortmund didn't get exactly what they wanted, seems a good middle ground.

EDIT: It's £55m rising to £61m for those too lazy to do the math. "

It might be happening. 
Don't think Ornstein would be breaking the news if they weren't getting a replacement in.
Except he plays for Toulouse now
"Arsenal FC is a professional English football club (soccer team). They are attempting to buy a player, Aubameyang, from a German professional soccer team, Borussia Dortmund. The negotiations have been going on almost the entire month of January, when a brief ""transfer window"" opens up (a period where teams can buy and sell players), and are believed to be nearing an end as this insider reports that Arsenal is finally close to sealing the deal and successfully buying Aubameyang from Dortmund.

Not mine. Found it on Twitter.
"I figure, but they really would rather keep him and his hostility in the team for another 6 months?"
"No they won't, Ornstein literally sais the transfer won't be sanctioned.."
"Thank you!! This has been the problem for a while now imo. The problem is Lovren is a good defender, although not consistent. But when you've got everyone pressing like mad men, you leave yourself vulnerable. Klopp's tactics although entertaining and amazing leave too much vulnerability at the back... 

I'm sure having Brendan Rodger's in-charge of Liverpool now; you'd see a far far better defensive line. Sure you'd lose that attacking dynamism at the front with Rodger's but the team would have more structure.

 "
"Nope, you're wrong."
Send Pronger to Chelsea. He's plenty big enough to fill in for Giroud.
An Oiler/Gooner. You and I would be such good friends. 
Ayy shoutout Alberta. We outcheaaa
As a ducks fan thanks for that one 
"Imagine working for a company in a third world, where you're constantly throwing in goodies to entice people to come over and work — welcome to my life. It does not surprise me that his wife doesn't want to leave London."
They don't want Welbeck. Conte said he needs a target man
"> Would rather give them Welbeck.

Lol at how people keep saying this as if anyone wants Welbeck."
"35m is amazing for Giroud.  He's going to drop to 3rd choice with Laca in the side.

As long as we can invest that 35m (and that's a big if, I'm fine with letting Giroud go).
"
Welbeck is not good enough for a team of their calibre and you know that.
This is what we should hope is true.
"All well and said, but you these lads will need rotating if you're going to get far in the Europa and fight for a 4th place. Giroud also offers something different to the team, however judging by Wenger's tactics, I still don't think Giroud is suited for Arsenal at all."
But Laca and Giroud are our only quality strikers being able to play in the EL.
But better!
They don't need goals then?
They've probably been keeping in mind that Aubameyang could be leaving and already have targets + Auba fee in mind so it'd be unlikely to be broken off.
Still more time than what City allotted us in the summer. 
"Why is it that we've left this little time? Negotiations have been going on for longer than that, they should have been looking all this time. "
"We haven't left them 3 days, have you every negotiated in your life? They've been searching for a replacement since our interest, they don't just start looking now that we've agreed on a price. "
"Only 220? Pffft, amateur!"
"Don't see why it wouldn't be better to sign a true winger than play Laca out of position. Wenger didn't exactly transform Perez into an outstanding out-of-position striker, and the lad seemed extremely committed from what I saw of him.

If we change the formation or use it as a ploy to get Mesut to re-sign, I'm okay with it I guess."
"Yeah your guess is as good as mine. This is just uncharted territory for me, I've always been excited by big name signings, but something feels off with this one. "
Stop pissing on my dream
I can't believe you took a comment in a Ornstein thread seriously. 
"You're right, really should be happy that this is happening at all. Just a bit frustrated with Gazidis and co."
Lol we have had the whole month we should have given them 2-3 WEEKS
But if Giroud goes to Chelsea then Batshit may go to Dortmund.
That's what my son and I call him. We've got nicknames for a lot of players.
Hmm....I wouldn't sell Batshit if I were Chelsea. He's pretty useful.
Kicker stated in their article that he is possible. They would not have mentioned him if getting him is impossible. They reported he has a price tag of 30m euros.
Add Bendtner to it and you'll have summed up our banter era strikers in one name

Can't see it coming tbh.
"Yeh but after Lemar failed it was all, fuck Arsenal they're incompetent."
We did with Alexis 
Better than playing without a striker/with a kid who's not ready as their main man. BvB are having a shocking season and will need everything possible to salvage it - even an irritated Auba.
20?
He can even replace Costa as far as style of play goes.
Huh. DAMMIT PRONGER is surprisingly universal.
"There's no feeling quite like having your expectations perfectly raised, and then expertly crushed by management year after year, is there?"
"At least we got Dustin Penner!

*Sobs in a corner*"
And I agree with you - I'm just saying I don't want to lose someone as useful (and pretty) as Giroud to a competitor. 
"As a reminder of how the English language works - 'would rather' is essentially saying that if anyone was to go - I would personally prefer Welbeck to leave over Giroud. 

Personal opinion and what will actually happen are two completely different things - even if I may slightly agree with you (I still think Welbeck could do well at a mid tier team). "
but I don't want that beautiful man to play in that ugly jersey :(
"Mate, it’s going in the war chest with several industrial sized padlocks."
"I have zero faith in that money being reinvested in someone better than Giroud. Wenger will look at Auba, Lacazette and Welbeck and deem it enough depth... and maybe he'll be right, but Giroud provides us with both depth and a versatility of approach which will be hard to otherwise match.

In theory selling Oli for that money is a no brainier, especially at his age, but given that it's to a direct rival at a critical moment of our season I don't feel very comfortable with it."
It would pain me to see Giroud in a Chelsea kit but if we got that kind of money to put towards a bid for wantaway Fabinho then that would make an insane transfer window.
YOU KNOW NOTHING JOHN SNUUU
"Yeah, just read that he'd like to stay in London. Worrying if true. Never thought of it from giroud's perspective "
[deleted]
I missed a zero :( 
"Wenger allows his players to interchange on the field, so I imagine the front 3 could be very fluid. We played this formation with Palace, albeit with Laca in the center, Ozil out wide, and Xhaka pairing with Wilshere. Ozil was out the right wing, but of course, drifted inward quite a bit. Both Laca and Auba have played on the wing earlier in their careers, so they know the position. "
I feel foolish
None of this will matter once BVB get their replacement and both parties come to a conclusion. 
What do you think they've been doing all month? They've got three or four different strikers lined up. We're golden.
"Why not just cut out the middle man and loan Giroud to Dortmund? I want him to stay but if he's going, why loan to a rival?"
True. Didn't know Chelsea wanted Giroud
I will cut off my dick if Giroud suits up for Chelsea. 
Well go on then let's hear some more 
Hopefully bvb get him or someone else for replacement... coyg

Fellow NL and Arsenal fan? Is this meant to be?
Holy crap his first touch is amazing. 
Going over the Lemar rejection thread youre right but tbf the anti-arsenal circlejerk was in full motion considering we had just lost 4-0 to the Scousers
Alexis never was kept out of the squad and had our manager stating toxic he was
You lost me man?
"I understand that, but since no one would want him, preferring Welbeck to go is completly irrelevant."
"""I'm gorgeous"" //O. Giroud"
...........okay?
Don't feel so attacked
"I wish Giroud's wife was cool with Germany, him on loan til summer would be so perfect for everyone. He gets WC football, Dortmund get a replacement until summer giving them time to plan shit out, we keep Giroud."
Says in an article on one of Dortmund most reliable sources that Giroud doesn't want to go to Dortmund due to personal reasons. Probably that fact he wants to stay in London. The only way this deal might go through is we give Chelsea Giroud meaning Batshuayi can go to Dortmund 
The wife doesn't want to leave London.
Or give them welbeck.
Everyone wants Giroud. Only some foolish Arsenal fans hate him.
"Giroud is a good player, it's just that the qualities he has is not suitable to Wenger's playing style. He has formidable aerial presence, and when you consider a lot of the goals Morata has scored are headers you can understand why Chelsea would be interested. Giroud also has that physicality which is what Morata lacks. "
"If they're looking at Crouch, Carroll and Dzeko they'd jump at Giroud, he's better than them all"

"Yeh the whole point of signing a forward in Auba is to replace Alexis. We didn’t get a like-for-like swap (position wise) in the deal for Mkhitaryan. 
Letting Giroud go will (almost) defeat the object of bringing in striking reinforcement. Also Giroud is awesome and I want him to stay.

Having said that I’d happily see him at Dortmund over Chelsea any day. We’ve let too many players go to domestic rivals!"
Me too. He's my favorite player. Gonna suck to see him go.
She might not want to let him out her sight for that long....
Right its what a 2 hour flight and they are millionaires.
"Its not even 6 months, Season finishes on mid may, so just 3.5 months till then. Would not be an issue if BVB agree and pay big loan fee to Arsenal."

Incredible substitution. 
He's a good guy good player but he lacks that touch of magic that Henry had. Makes all the difference. 
Even some of the stuff he did for France in the Euro's. Half the reason Greizmann played so well was because he had Giroud drawing defenders and giving him space. I think a lot of the reason Giroud has been so maligned is we probably haven't had the right combination up front to compliment him. You can fault his energy or his intent.
"Giroud should be in the starting lineup when we play ""smaller"" clubs at home who decide to park the bus and play on the counter like the Middlesbrough. We all realized how much we missed Giroud after that game. We can still play with our current lineup if we go away to these smaller clubs but Giroud can be a our super sub like today. I just hope Wenger employs these tactics because I know he has a long history of continuing to stick with same lineup no matter what, and not tweaking it from game to game based on opposition, only when injury makes it necessary."
Super sub!! Ole Gunnar who?
"We front page now bois.

I don't understand how the internet/twitter fanbase can give him so much stick. If he had a deplorable attitude off the pitch I would understand but he keeps on overcoming every kind of difficulty, he scores for Arsenal and shows his passion. 

Unfortunately for him for each of his achievements there will always be a ""yes but it was shit opposition"" ""yes but we didn't win the match"" ""yes but he scored thanks to a mistake from the defense"" ""yes but he scores because Özil/Sanchez/other is having the best game of their life and the least he could do is score"" well FUCK OFF.

"He's a really good target man style centre forward, and always was.

And if ever a match gave lie to the concept of Giroud being an ""either,or"" thing it was this one.

It's not always Giroud time, but a large proportion of our season is spent attempting to break through packed penalty areas - which is most definitely Giroud time."
"The logical grievances though have always been ""Giroud isn't good enough to be our only striker"" and it's been people's frustration at Wenger for not signing competition/the injury gods for injuring Welbeck that has come out unfortunately in the most basic way to interpret the situation, aka shitting on giroud.

Now that he isn't, now that he's second choice, look at how fired up he is. He's a different player. This guy is a true super sub and our plan B all in one."
They just hate him cuz he's gorgeous. 
I think most always rated him highly. The issue was that he was not enough to win us the league on his own. I think we will be seeing the best out of him now that there is so much competition up front

FTFY"
I would argue the efficacy was they had set up in their ways and tired themselves out. Pulled off iwobi and bring on giroud and bang he's a super sub. Much more effective giving him 25 mins of savagery than starting him against a fucking average Sunderland 
"That's just a myth though. He's scored against United, City, Bayern, Dortmund, Liverpool, Everton.. not just small teams like Spurs. "
"Always thought he was a victim of circumstance. He came in the same window RvP left, fans wanted a a suitable striker replacement to pick up the slack, but Giroud was all that we got. Since then, and still up to right now, he's been our starting striker and it's sad to see fans always shitting on him for not being world class because it's simply not his fault. Wenger hasn't replaced RvP still, and that leads to Giroud getting most of the stick.

If we had signed a world class striker and Giroud performed exactly as he has since joining, I feel he'd be revered as a wonderful bargain of a striker. Though, because of circumstance out of his control, he is potentially our most polarising player in the squad and repeatedly catches a lot of flack.

*Note: Not saying he doesn't deserve criticism, but for that we paid for the man, it's been a wonderful signing and I'm a huge fan."

"Many? Like 2? That's barely even plural, much less 'many'"
"Iwobi doesn't seem to have the tank for more than 70 minutes, he looks very tired by that stage each game. Another great benefit of Alexis is that he can play 90 minutes anywhere across the front 3, which is probably going to allow Iwobi to get more starts. "

Laca vs Bayern in China gonna be his first real game and judgement from football fans. 
Would love to see Iwobi take a step up this year. He can learn from Walcott's mistake.
"A striker with pace, who can pick the ball up and beat a man, and is a good finisher. We are going to score so many fucking goals this season. I just hope we don't give up a ton either "
"That look of ""Welp that's the man who'll take my spot"" from Giroud though.."
"As an Aussie I was mostly embarrassed by the state of that pitch, but it was nice to see Laca net his first goal. "
"Anyone else see Giroud's body language say, ""Ah, shite.""? 
That being said, I love him and I hope he stays."

What a finish! Holy shit. Ballon D'or confirmed. 
I have the largest smile known to man right now. My co-worker is wondering why I suddenly have this huge grin. #9
"He said ""Eat your heart out Giroud."""
"Giroud seems really excited! Lmao

Bust. Not even a 4th place team anymore.

Solid 114 goal season incoming
Averaging .007978 goals per 90 minutes since he signed for us. 
League champions confirmed 
"The movement, I'm still drooling. Haven't seen that kind of movement from an Arsenal striker in a long time. Excited!"
Holdini !
And never let me go
LIKE THE RIVER JORDAN

I hope you do this the entire season. 
just wait its coming!
"Makes a run, in great position asks for the ball and then BOOM new guy.

Ah, merde. Est-ce que c'est ma vie?"
He is after his spot in the Arsenal team and the national side. I'm sure they are great friends but even so I'm sure there is some resentment there. 
Me too. I wanted Giroud to score this match.  
"Me too , but this competition will get the best out of him."
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed that :(
How does he seem disappointed?
Lacazette's positioning was much better.
He needs to get over himself
You must have missed the game vs Benfica a couple of years ago
Compared to Walcott hitting the ball at every defender between him and the goal the composed finish was a delight.
"Can you imagine how difficult it would be to defend a cross with Giroud, Lacazette, and Ramsey all making runs? Gonna give defenders PTSD."
"Lets hope he gets a flying start in the league as well.

Gervinho scored 2 goals in his preseason debut, so it can go either way."
"Yes I'm happy we have an extra guy who can take penalties as well as natural box poaching. Sometimes with wellbeck, Ozil or iwobi I am not as confident in a clinical finish or even the run. "
Also the defender backing off in the last three paces to leave the slot wide open for him
Welbz would put it 1m wide
"Flamini would have put it through the keeper's legs, twice around his head, then down into the far corner."
Sanogo would completely mis-kick it into the path of Giroud who taps it in.
Giroud would sky it.
"I like to think that Giroud knew 100% that Laca was going to bury it that so he was just like ""meh, knew it"" cause he does go over to Laca after he scored."
"Didn't exactly sprint over to celerate. Maybe he was tired for the running he just did, not the fastest man on the planet."
Giroud know he's gone.
Yeah he looked downright sad there...
"37 last season, with better service (at Arsenal) can definitely see 30 goals this season from this man."
What a great finish. We've need someone like that for so long 
"thanks for this! wasn't able to watch so this was clutch. that defensive take away when he tracks back and then the through back to ox, holy shit! completely changed the momentum of that play in 5 seconds "
It's in front of the stands...
what a manchild
Cms still cant cover tho.

Except where that goal only happened because Giroud drew defenders away and opened the space.
We had like 6/7 youth players playing... relax. 
And 50 would be from the spot. Fucking penalty merchant.
I appreciate that you did the maths for this
He ran in a straight line and scored a tap in...
"Sarcasm? Because it was Giroud's movement that allowed for the goal. Lacazette ran straight for almost 60 yards. 

I thought it was interesting that Giroud didn't seem all that excited for him either. "
"lol are you having a laugh? he literally ran in a straight line, Giroud peeling off and drawing the defender away gave him the opportunity. "
You're easily excited
AND I WILL THEN SAY TO THEE
*overhead Bicycle kick
What. The. Fuck.
The most disturbing upvote gif I've ever seen.
It's what dreams are made of 
"Honestly that's the most underrated part of Giroud's game. It was completely the right decision by Iwobi to cross to Lacazette (obviously), because Giroud drew his defender towards the far post and opened up space for the second run. It would be a huge detriment to our team if we let Giroud go. Laca and Oli should use being on the same club team to their advantage and give Deschamps a reason to think about a 2 striker system."
These guys have winners mentalities. It would be insane for there not to be a competitive element towards the new boy from Giroud. I hope Wenger can find a way to effectively implement both of them. 
Didn't show any excitement or any emotion as soon as the goal was scored. 
"Or, Giroud distracted the defense with his run and allowed lacazette in. "
Tbh giroud makes a good move for the far post. Iwobi played the safer pass in the end which can only mean its preseason. 
Wish he'd get over me.
Who pissed in your cornflakes. 
 that game was peak hype!
Unbridled chaos!
C
Featuring the best goal celebration of all time.
"Positioning is great, but it's all about how he squares, locks on to the shot and really meaningfully slides it with power just where it needs to go. Very exciting."
Giroud making runs?
Messisacker would no-look bicycle flick it into the top corner
"What's frustrating to me is that we can't really drop them because of the home-grown quota. I'm not opposed to the quota, it's just the annoyance of having two players who are fairly ensconced not deliver the goods.

Their finishing is so bog."
Na he'd kick the floor or something
I hope you're right mate
"lol please dude, I could taste the salt from here. Giroud was just pissed he didn't get the ball."
"It would be nice to think that, but in all honesty it was the look of the man who thinks he's been replaced. "
"Anyone who watches that goal that knows anything about footy can see that Giroud created that space for Lacazette to run into. It's one of the reasons Giroud is great for France paired with Griezmann. Without Giroud's movement, Laca doesn't score that. "
"Don't take this thing seriously. /u/goonerclaude [is just an alt account](http://imgur.com/a/SgZWI) for [our favorite ex-Leicester supporter] (http://m.imgur.com/a/5zBvZ)  /u/vanadiumdioxide.

To explain. The first link shows that this is indeed /u/vanadiumdioxide. Unless the crossover between /r/delraymisfits, /r/wallstreetbets, and /r/gunners is more than any of us would be aware of. /u/vanadiumdioxide was a troll on here who used to throw on a Leicester flare over at /r/soccer and support Leicester up until they were knocked out of the UCL, then he became a full time Arsenal ""fan."" He is also a racist Trump supporting American that says things like ""mate"" or ""bloke"" in an attempt to act British on here so that people will take him more seriously."
...sagged like a deer taking a bullet
"Yea, that was his best play for me. "
holy shit i have referee vision 
"It's just a matter of Aaron Ramsey remaining at his ppositii n and not pushing up too much. Xhaka doesn't move from the center of the pitch. While he may lack the pace, he's stopping anything that comes near him. Albeit, probably by fouling them. "
"you can might as well use that excuse on any one else, in any goalscoring situation then."
"I dunno, looks like Welbz is the man for pens. I liked his swagger."
He did?
No other player would have thought of that. The defenders obviously didn't think anybody would be [bold](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2656344.1464736740!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/youtube1n-3-web.jpg) enough to make a run like that; straight towards goal - it's unheard of!
"The best strikers are always in the right place at the right time. There is an 'art' of arriving late into the box.

He made that goal look simple yes but he ran into the (correct) space, accelerated towards the ball at the last moment and had a tidy finish. 

Look at the run Giroud made for example, he wasn't available for the assist at the end of the move. So Lacazette had great movement, I don't see the issue."
"Youre right, giroud created the space in the middle with his run. And the fact he didnt seem that excited catched my attention as well, sad thing"
"Timing of the run, positioning, movement & finish.  "
LAACAAZETTE
*over everyone's head but his own bicycle kick
*overhead kick
What the fuck
"there's a full video on yt somewhere. its' some french thing, i have no fucking idea what its' about"
Xhaka looks so happy hugging Lacazette in the celebration. He knows it's coming.
Boom Lacaxhaka!
Deschamps uses a 2 striker system already with Giroud and Griezmann
"You are of course right.  Ollie drew away the defence from the middle.

Yes its only a friendly in Sydney, but we can see where this is going and it is beautiful.  Hopefully, we see L9 returning the favour soon and Ollie gets the religion of two in the front.
"
"I can see a deadly combo of laca and giroud up top, Sanchez and lemar at the wings, ozil in attacking mid, rotation of 2 mids with Ramsey xhaka and coq, and then we can have 3 at the back. How to use our new signing lb will be hard to figure out. I don't want to play him out of position"
That screams suicidal for me. #pray4giroud #1upvote1prayer
"Or, Giroud was just making a run for himself and Laca ran into the space created and converted. It's allowed, you know. It's a team. "
I'm just glad we finally had 2 runners in the box!
"You and me both, and most other people in the world. "
The real question is: why are people defending Giroud acting like he's not being a dickhead sulking like that? I'm just calling him out and rightfully so.
H
"What the fuck are you lot on about, it was a literal tap in"
Giroud's runs into the box are great. He peels off the cb excellently and is even pretty good at those finishes while still battling with the defender and receiving the ball.
Half the reason Laca scored this goal is because Giroud made the run to drag the right side CB out. 
He's slow but he always makes decent runs and often that change of direction that attracts defenders to concentrate on him. He does it well for France too
"He's slow, but he's strong, so defenders have to get really close to him. If he makes a far post run you can guarantee he's pulling a defender out of position"
"Giroud has excellent movement off the ball and is always popping up unmarked and pulling defenders out of position. He can't capitalize on it himself since he is not a speed merchant, but certainly in situations like this huge opportunities will arise when the defenders are having to choose between defending against Giroud for crosses or defending against midfielders making runs. I think john stones said Giroud was the most difficult player to mark that he had ever played and that he had better movement than aguero and suarez."
"Yes, his burst runs combined with his strength and technique is a nightmare for defenders. Hummels said he was the most difficult forward he's played. Also, runs like these create space behind him. That's why Giroud Ramsey was a poor man's Drogba Lampard a few years ago. Laca was in acres of space because Giroud gave it to him. Great timing and finish, but if the defenders would have been on him it would have been more difficult."
As if that's ever going to happen
"or you know, it's a meaningless friendly."
Did I need to add /s as if a professional footballer might be tired from a quick sprint?
Yes but as football now is more obsessed with stats than actual performance he did nothing. His excellent performance there means he's one step closer to the door.
Bruhhh. Weve seen enough. Xhaka cant cover for when the fbs are caught out which happens all the time. Tbh it happens all the time w 3atb also but there is a cb to cover and chase. 
"Not true at all, for example, what if the player just dribbles through the defenders? What if a player beats the defenders in the air? Here, it clearly does."
"1/0.007978 = ~123 ninety minute periods to accrue one goal

123 * 90 = 11070 minutes

11070 / (24 * 60) = ~7.7 days

Lacazette signed 5th of July, today is 13th of July, 13 - 5 = 8 less a few hours"
Error Giroud dragged the defenders away so that Lacazette had a clean shot 
"I agree that Lacazette's timing on the run was great, but it only worked because Giroud started closer to goal and occupied the defender (which you say downthread). Giroud loves to cut to the near post, so I think he was aware of Lacazette and left space for him to arrive (while still wanting to get the ball)."
"You seem him jogging over at the end of the clip, i think Giroud is just not that excited about a routine goal against Sydney, even if it is Laca's first"
Of course it's French. Lmao. 
Xhakazette
He will pull him aside post group celebration and they will just fist bump with an explosionnn
Boom XhakaLaca
"In that case I'm not sure why Giroud is scared for his first team spot. No one else in the France national team provides what he does. Unfortunately for Lacazette he's not competing with Giroud, he's competing with Griezmann and Mbappe."
"Well, that sounds like an extremely attack heavy formation, maybe good for games against lower skilled opposition? Or we could just go full Liverpool"
"well, if there was no one in the box, focus would have been on the player who is trying to make a run. you say its a team and you say  giroud was making a run for himself. ironic."
to be fair if Iwobi looked up a second earlier he could of whipped it across the face of goal for Giroud but because he didn't Laca was 100% the only choice.
A
">and that he had better movement than aguero and suarez.

Can you back that up with a quote from Stones?"
"Right, aside from what our players did right, Sydney did a lot wrong. Their midfielder should have tracked Lacazette's run, but he just didn't have the fitness to get back in time."
"No no no, this is /r/gunners . We know exactly what everybody is thinking and doing simply by looking at their celebration and body language. Clearly Giroud has quit on the team and doesn't care anymore and is super selfish, despite all of things he has said and done for us in the past. All that stuff is irrelevant because he didn't go to celebrate in a meaningless friendly, in a goal he wasn't involved in. Trust me, we're *never* wrong. "
"Doesn't look that way to most of the team, stop apologizing."
"In that case, you can always point the reason to a goal to something so superficial to undermine any player's clinical ability. If a player just dribbles through defenders to score, you can always throw in 'weak and indecisive defending from the backline ', beating them in the air to score a header as 'poor man marking and weak defending from set pieces'. Why not just accept that lacazette is clearly the more clinical and composed finisher that we have ever seen for a long while, for a true CF/striker position, besides alexis being the other player who has the same traits despite being a forward that can play in all 3 attacking positions. If you are going to say giroud drew defenders, you might as well just add in sydney fc's poor defending by not manmarking laca on his run. "
All I'm getting from this is that we now have to steal the Declaration of Independence? 
"His signing was announced at 17:00 GMT, so noon for me."
"I guarantee you Giroud wanted to score that for himself (Look at his reaction after the goal). Whilst I fully agree that Giroud's run helped create space, he didn't really put himself in a position to receive the final ball. You'll see this season that they fundamentally have different movement."
Error if you notice the defenders were ball watching and did not follow Giroud. All round mediocre play there! 
"No that's xhaka at the end I think, not Giroud "
I feel this is what we should refer to it as until it happens. It'll make the moment more special. 
This is true hence why I think keeping Giroud is essential to our squad we got Laca instead of Griezmann (who we probably wouldn't be able to get anyway) but I also feel Laca is more clinical than Griezmann at the same age.
I agree that it is very attacking but I am trying to figure out how to use ox as a defensive winger
"It may be ironic word choice but both statements are true... Giroud made that run for himself, not with the intention of creating space. That run created the space for Lacazette to run into. How are they mutually exclusive?"
O
O
">‘I mean they are great players, with unbelievable movement. In all honesty, I’d have to say Olivier Giroud, you don’t realise how strong he is,’ the England international told Mundial Magazine when asked to pick between the trio.

>‘When he gets close to you he can hold you off and his touch is brilliant.’

[Source from a 2 second google search](http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/12/everton-ace-john-stones-claims-arsenal-star-olivier-giroud-is-tougher-to-mark-than-luis-suarez-and-sergio-aguero-5939167/)"
He's a world class striker who was fresh and had a point to prove. It would be a lot to ask for a mediocre Sydney midfielder to anticipate and track him. Especially so after 75 minutes.
Sanchez umbro shorts commercial deal confirmed.
He's all celebrated out after the equaliser vs Bournemouth 
Oh my god I agree with you but everyone please stop posting in this style it's the worst 
"Or ya know, Giroud is a different person from the rest of the team with a different mindset. Most players don't celebrate friendly goals."
"1) Giroud would have and has scored that exact goal 1000%, it was a tap-in. Lets calm down 2) You're seriously arguing that ""drawing defenders"" isn't a thing? Really...? Makes me question your footballing brain. "
Because you have no grasp on the collaborative effort that a team must make in order to create space. If Giroud had not veered off to the far post then suddenly the defender is three yards closer to Lacazette and able to block the shot. It's great timing and technique from Lacazette but Giroud also played a big part in this goal. 
[The numbers don't lie](https://gfycat.com/OrneryDearHarlequinbug)
[removed]
I'm sure he did want to score the goal but at least he did run at the defender before trying to drift off behind him.  Too often he runs straight with the defenders and doesn't move off them enough.  His run also did occupy that defender.
I prefer it to Boom Xhaka Laca tbh
"He did create the space (inadvertently), maybe. But that allowed lacazette some space to score too. Saying that giroud was selfish is plain stupid when having two forwards playing in a team simultaneously creates chances and openings for other players as well rather than depending on a single player and making him the point of focus. "
S
O
X
"Yes, but where is he talking about Giroud having better movement? He does not say that at all."
"Not gonna lie, I do hate myself for it. But it's the extreme ying to the other extreme's yang. There's just too many comments about his celebration and conclusions drawn from it, I had to do it.

It's especially annoying since we saw it happen multiple times last season too. Ramsey's celebrations, Giroud's, Ozil's, and others. And it's always just overanalysis to a fault. And they're usually the top comments too. "
"never argued the fact giroud drew the defenders away, but a goal's a goal. you could have put walcott there and assuming he continued with his absurd performance today, could still not have scored given the opportunity. and this wasn't a pure tap-in, he still beat the keeper to the ball. i only comment because you made it sound it was only possible with giroud, but you take away the fact laca did it so cool and professionally with his first debut, first opportunity at goal, and the efforts he took to get himself into the position. Don't bother questioning it when yours is questionable in itself."
"The argument here is saying he only scored because of Giroud. That's where i beg to differ, because i commend what Laca did to get into that position to beat the keeper to score and felt it held greater weightage. Iwobi could have made that pass and still leave us with a goal-less end product when it falls under the feet of current off-form players like walcott(given benefit of doubt as its pre-season), as evidently seen today. Giroud did play a big part, but to say its all down to that to score that goal? absolute rubbish. laca made a good run, beat the keeper with his cool and collected composure and did not shoot STRAIGHT at the keeper unlike what a couple of our players are guilty of doing in many games previously. it was a simple clinical, basic and clean goal and that is what is great about it. This is what we'd love to see more often and SHOULD be doing in order to be beating teams and winning as many games as possible; by being ruthless and keeping things basic before we move on to our fancy football which we are guilty of doing so too much"

I didn't see anyone call him selfish? Making the run for himself just means he expected to receive the ball
Click the link and read it then.
"I didn't question any of those things...

The fact is, the space opened up because Giroud drew the defenders. That is ALL I said. I mentioned nothing about Lacazette because I agree, he needed to recognize the space and finished it well, which again..never questioned. Seems you're pulling things out of nowhere. "
"Fair play, Lacazette is obviously better than Walcott and Welbz but without Giroud that goal wouldn't have happened. No Giroud movement = no space = no shot = no goal. "
"Are you dense? He says Aguero and Suarez have incredible movement, he **then** says Giroud is the toughest he's had to mark, not the same thing at all."
"I did, and nowhere does he claim that Giroud has better movement than Suarez and Aguero, I know this sub likes to make Giroud seem amazing, but fabricating quotes is silly.

Im sure /u/jenkinsear147 will love this."
"""Except where **that goal only happened** because Giroud drew defenders away and opened the space.""  
I'm sure that wasn't made to sound like it didn't mean more than that. but i think this should just stop here. we know what we meant, and all i'm saying is credits have to be given where its due, esp when its a goal. to put it all down to 'because it was ONLY due to XXX creating space by drawing out defenders that he could score' (which after rewatching the replay a couple more times, just looking carefully; how effective really were the defenders in marking out giroud? another sydney FC MF player didn't make the extra effort to intercept the pass to Laca just a few meters ahead of him as well. in this case if anything, it was bad defending, but this is football and the difference in both teams' quality is obvious to see) is really such a shallow way to put across and credit the goal that Laca just scored for himself."
You literally just typed the answer yourself and yet fail to see it. Not gonna spend time and energy on this level of stupidity.
"Giroud is better than Aguero and Suarez according to John Stones!  

Somehow it has become gospel that hes indispensable to the club despite never being anywhere close to as good as so many of our best strikers over the years.  

It's really strange and annoying. 

"
"Well, I suggest you read it again, slower this time.

Literally the first text under the picture"
"You were claiming that Stones said that Giroud had better movement than those two, I dispelled it and had to explain the answer to you because you were stupid enough not to differentiate and misunderstood his quote, you really are an idiot, why do I waste my time with people like you."
"It says he thinks Giroud is tougher to mark, not that his movement is better."

He scored this beauty on January 1st. Didn't even give the rest of the year a chance. Legend.
I feel so lucky to have been at the match to witness such an incredible goal!
Only took him a day to win goal of the year
"This was my view for the goal that day. Giroud's strike will stay with me forever for many reasons. Not only was it one of the most beautiful goals of all time but it was all the more special as it was the first Arsenal match I had been to in over two years. I had had a tough couple of years before this match, for a long while I wasn't even sure if I'd ever see a Arsenal match again. Arsenal, and football in general, had been a crutch for me during those hard times. Thus the day was special for me anyway, but to have the goal right in front of me and for the celebration to be right by me. It means so much! I am glad that this little moment of my own personal history will be remembered for years to come!

"Arsenal represented real nice this show. The fans, the scarf, goal of the year. i like it"
Well deserved. 
Giroud was freaking hoofin it down the field after that backheel flick. I think that's the fastest I've ever seen him run. Proud of our beautiful frenchman!
Stung by the moses scorpion himself
Legend <3
"Coyhfb 

Edit- added handsome :)"
"I think Mandzukic's was better, but given the final 3 he definitely deserved to win. "
"Our fanbase hella reminds me of /pol/ from 4chan. Weaponized autism lol. 


But that's not to say his goal didn't deserve it.  "
It was a fluke. Long range shots are more deserving than this goal.
Some on here agreed as well.  Mental.
"Didn't Mhikitaryan win PL goal of the season or something over Giroud too? Boiled my blood, that one was both offsides and not even comparable in buildup."
Link to the Carroll goal?
Yes.
Men 💪
*sploosh* x2
"I need my fix. I see him on QI and I just think ""mate, cant you just go home after recording this and just fucking get your mates round to do another podcast please?"""

"Sums up /r/gunners. The FA don't even give out the goal of the season, it's a BBC Match of the Day vote."

"Aah, the 5 seconds that cost us the title.. /s"

"Me too, its one of the best moments of my life hands down! "
"New Year's Day... no sleep straight to the game... didn't know if I was tripping out still, unreal "

"That is incredible! You're so lucky.

I was in Stockholm for ""That Ibrahimovic Goal"" against England. I was sitting behind Joe Hart in absolute disbelief."
Hey fuck all you cunts that saw it live at the stadium.
And they say he is slow...
that's so great!
Shine on you crazy diamond ;-;

I did leave it in the post bro! But thanks for being helpful :) 
Not available in the US. But of course the Green Carpet crap was...sheesh.
Thanks for that interesting stat :)

I love it when he throws the head back. You can just see him straining for that little bit of extra pace he wants! 
How was Mandzukic's better? The fact that two players had to chest the ball to control it loses it for me.
"M8, did u c the power in that overhead kick from Carroll??? Proper no nonsense good old English striker. Makes me well proud to have witnessed the best goal ever. Hopefully after votin Brexit itll keep all these foreign twats out and we'll c more bangers like the 1 frm Carroll "

"Emre Can won it. It was a great goal, but not comparable to Giroud's imo"

He was on QI?!
Goal of the season actually went to Emre Can. To be fair it was an amazing goal.
Since Wilshere's second win they stopped it being a vote and made it up to the pundits
Everyone read your comment wrong lol
You shouldn't mention that match around these parts. The Anti Giroud crowd will jump down your throat for a 12 second celebration that didn't even change anything as Bournemouth had to kick off anyway.
3-3 vs Bournemouth 
"This was our come back last season vs. Bournemouth.

The one that made us miss CL.
"You could see his cheeks puffing out there but shiit, I could not run that fast, so I shouldn't be calling him slow."

I can get behind the gk one as for the importance of the goal
"Didn't watch it, I only watch prestigious awards ceremonies KIDDING!

Do you have the timestamp for girouds award? 
"I was going to say because of the magnitude of the game, but apparently the situation isn't taken into account so I gues I was wrong."
Proper brexit that azza
Why do the English hate the working class so much? 
Shades of Don Cherry in hockey.
I would like to vote this comment for the Puskas copypasta award.
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted when what you’re saying is completely reasonable and correct
"He's talking about comedian Alan Davies, who on his Arsenal podcast *The Tuesday Club* regularly uses an exaggerated French voice when talking as Giroud. 

Look up ""Alan Davies I AM GIROUD"" to get a better idea of what he says"
Still not better than the Puskas winning goal so..
"It’s still a vote, the pundits select from the top 3 though."
Pretty sure that was losing to Liverpool at home in the first game.
We'd have missed CL by even more if Giroud hadn't bailed us out of that loss.
Lol no worried! If people use both our links then they can have double the fun of seeing Giroud with his award ;) 
about 20 mins into the broadcast

Only 3 words are needed to describe this goal... What a magic.
Those slowmos on the last replay were fucking mint. 
"Chipping the keeper, then proceeding to cut inside despite a wide open goal, then casually strolling across the goal as defenders desperately dive to the floor one after another, not a care in the world, then finally assisting the net by passing the ball ever so gently into it. That will go down as one of the best individual goals in arsenals history. "
WHAT. THE. FUCK. OZIL. PLS. 
New link for the goal: https://streamable.com/7vow
"It's been a long time I haven't been as happy for a goal ! :)

Nice goal, and worth noting aswell the good intuition from Giroud who came back very far in defence where he wasn't supposed to be while the team was in a very attacking mindset, and stole the ball out of nowhere to put it in the feet of Elneny that immediately found Ozil alone in front of goal, we can't see it on the replay but it was cool too. Of any moment he chose the 87th minute to come back in defence when the mindset was attacking, it's not logic, it takes confidence to take that kind of intuitive initiative.

Just wanted to point that out. This kind of intuitive plays is not something you learn from anyone and it requires confidence.

Truly sensational composure. 10 years later and we have someone to fill the Bergkamp shirt. Watch that goal and imagine Bergkamp scoring it and it'd be a classic. I just don't think you understand.
Creamed my pants there.

Honestly looks like he could have done this whole goal with an egg instead of the ball, and still not crack the shell. Delicate little bastard. Love him.

Not today November.
"HOLY FUCKING SHIT! Do you guys know how good this goal actually is? 99% of the players in that position would chip it first time. Ozil puts it over the goalkeeper, sits two players down, fakes a shot and then slots it in. So, so good. What a player."
WE'VE GOT OZIL. MESSIT OZIL. I JUST DUN THINK YA UNDASTANDDDDD.

"What a goal, guy is pure class and I love him."
The touch over the keeper is some next level shit. Unreal 
I've not seen the same composure and coolness of thought since probably Maradona Vs Eng world cup '86 (his 2nd goal btw!) 
"Dirt nasty
"
How has this escaped a NSFW tag??
"Keeper so lucky not to get sent off, so far out of box trying to touch it. Heartbreaking if he got a hand to it."
"This is a ""remember where you were when"" type of goal."
A goal fit for a king.
"Just like to point out... WTF was the keeper doing? Came all the way out of his box, and still tried to get a hand to it?

Never the less, my favourite goal of the season so far."
"Mesut ""A Gift from Heaven"" Ozil..MAGFHO no. 10 next season."
FUCK ALL Y'ALL
"Clutch, skill, leadership, limelight...I think this goal is huge for a player who's trying to make his mark on a club that's trying to regain world class status. I fucking love you Mesut. Pls retire in our colors."
by far the second most impressive thing is el neny playing the long ball himself and then being the first one there to celebrate with özil

Bloody hell. Us fans are like shoot shoot. While Ozil more like relax people. I got this in. 
Such a beautiful goal!

"Buy it now, mate. He has earned you wearing it a mere 7 months... I bought his cup top last year, (the butt flaps, while great on TV were butt (heh) ugly on a supporter) and bought the home this year (despite never buying a home kit before and already having Mesut 's cup) so I could enjoy a minimum one season of it. Özil is sensational, and, seriously, only Bergkamp has been similar in quality and style, for any team. EVEN if he leaves next year, his first season broke the trophy drought, and dude has brought it every time he pulls on our shirt. Whenever he ""struggled"" it was from a lack of understanding his nuance from our other players. He has been world class quality, ran more than most (check the stats, I'm lazy), and brought leadership into this team too (I cannot count the number of times I see him pushing our guys forward, etc.)

Buy it"
what does this even mean. 
Same for me. Maybe our best goal scored in the last 5 years ? or decade ? I can't think of anything better right now.

Nah dude it's just a kick over the defense. He made Ozil 1v1 with the keeper but it's still literally just a ball kick over the defense. Way to overrate a player who can only kick the ball. /s
He's Arsène Wenger's man
"Zack Snyder, presumably. Who ironically, will probably not get an Oscar for doing this to his own films."
Or just GözilA?
I like this one better cause it's pure talent and individual play.
That's the only better goal I've seen us score. That Theo goal against Newcastle was also a personal favorite.
"But to me ozil's goal beats them all. A showcase of unbelievable natural footballing talent and ball control, and ball control is my favourite thing to watch in football. Actually my favourite arsenal goals in recent memory were nasri's goals against fulham. There is something about ozil's way of carrying the ball, of running, that makes him so elegant, like bergkamp and zidane. They were just technically above everyone they played against and the most intelligent on the pitch. They never used tricks, just their ball control and body feints, and it was enough to beat anyone. They may not have been the uncontested best or most efficient players of their generation, but they were the most beautiful. True geniuses. This goal has some genius in it. A guy making other players look like kids, meanwhile he's looking like he has all the time in the world. Kind of like messi's insane goal against boateng and neuer. Sorry about the long post, just trying to explain my point of view. I havent loved a player like I love Ozil since I watched Zidane in the 2006 wc as a 14 yo. Truly a special goal."
Thomas Eisfeld was quality that's hard to argue with

Eis Eis baby.
Was he though? The guy's 23 and playing in the German second divison.
loool yeah i get you g
Is why to me that is the best goal ever soccered. I actually wrote that wrong by mistake but I think I'll just leave it like that.

Probably should've seen the sarcasm to be honest.

Those players who don't deserve a place in our team need to go. No more excuses, no saying he has heart or loves the club. I love the club but that doesn't mean I should start in the midfield. Clear out the deadwood.
I am embarassed. This is right up their with the worst I have ever felt as a spurs fan, because for once I though things had fucking changed. Why do spurs always do this to me? I hate the fucking hope because this always happens. I need a summer off."

"Turkish but in German NT, famous since 2010 (others players in your list became famous much later!), played in Real Madrid, Muslim. These traits attract many fans!

He is certainly among the most famous active footballers on the planet right now, behind cr7, messi and neymar. "
"That Messi account isn't official, he doesn't actually have a twitter account. "
"A few factors

1. 2010 World Cup. Twitter was gaining steam at that time, social media was becoming a bigger product as well. Ozil was a shining star on an exciting and young german team. 

2. The move to Real Madrid only helped Ozil. As mentioned, lots of Madrid players have a large social media following. Ozil's team uses social media a lot better than most. Simply being close to Ronaldo will give you a lot of followers. 

3. Ozil gets fans from Germany due to his play on the national team, from Turks due to his ethnicity, and the Muslim world due to his prominence as an ambassador of sorts. He received the Bambi award in Germany in 2010 for being the leading example of integration in german society. He is very open about his faith and represents it with style. Pretty much every young muslim that likes football looks up to Ozil. Yes there are other muslim players, even on arsenal, but they aren't on his level in quality or marketing.

4. In 2013 Ozil became one of the faces of Adidas which led into a lot of press and publicity for him going into the 2014 world cup. The move to Arsenal for what, at the time, was the second biggest transfer fee in premier league history, provided new markets for him to grow into as the prem is quite popular worldwide, more so than the bundesliga and la liga. 

All in all he is just a popular guy that plays a popular sport and does so in a way that emphasizes more than just raw talent or physicality."
Islam. Özil is Muslim and he is a good Muslim too. 
What Messi twitter account? The only one I could find was one for his foundation.
[removed]
"Real players typically have a big following, as do well-behaved Muslim players. "
He's Turkish
Nah that'd be Niasse
I was thinking a young AW
Is ok no
Seriously! What's with the not smiling?
He looks like he just ordered somebodys murder. 
What's your safe word?
That's what she said.
I chucked 
What's real madrid got to do with Pique? Lol
"I was thinking along the same lines. But then I saw Khedira at 800k, not even a million xD. He plays for German N.T.,from Madrid went to Juventus instead of Arsenal. Also a muslim. But hasn't even a million following."
Can you pull up some stats for popular arsenal players?
"Ozil also has a pretty good social media team working for him.
"
"Yeah, on FB & Insta, Ozil remains behind while on twitter, he is more popular. And by a great margin in both cases."
There is no official twitter handle of Messi and the one which is there is run by Adidas so that's why less people follow that account
But it is verified though. Got a blue tick.

Is Eboue.
Probably misses having legs 
He’s now a superagent.
La cabra
Dench
Se queda
Leave it
The goat! 
guffawed 
he married Shakira tho
"too stupid to not realize before reading your comment.... 

At first glance I was like ah ok makes sense. "
Pique embraces the twitter banter very actively 
Ha. My bad. You win. 
"He's a lot less flashy tho, he's not a flair player or a big character like ramos or pique. That's not good for branding."
I think Ozil is Germany's biggest start on the global scale. Outside of Germany he must be really popular with his years at Madrid and Arsenal.
Could be a Muslim audience?
"I don't have any numbers but strictly speaking out of my ass, it might be because Twitter has a larger database than the gram rivaled only by FB and even then the Twitter app is just so prevalent in today's app market. There's probably just more active users on twitter and like someone else commented, Ozil has been on the global stage far longer than the others you named save Messi and Cristiano."
"No it hasn't, check again. The only verified Messi twitter account is the team Messi one and that's Adidas related, not his actual account."
*Grabs other thigh*
Gets high.
Is ok 
No mas
Mine's Aaron Ramsey (that way it's not gay).
She played for real Madrid?
"Germany really doesnt have any marketable global stars despite being wc winners, so Ozil is the only one that stands out. All their best players over the years are backbone type players like lahm, schweinsteiger, neuer, or even ozil as opposed to flashy dribble goal machines. "
He has a massive following in Muslim countries
"Ozil isn't the only famous muslim footballer though. For eg. Khedira, who plays along Ozil in German N.T., played alongside Ozil in Real Madrid & later on went to Juventus has got 800k, ie. not even a full million. And he is a muslim too .

Also, why then is Ozil not as popular on Instagram & FB. I don't think that the muslim audience majorly uses Twitter :P"
"Ohh, that explains the case then. "
Is ok **yes**
No
"Christ, that song. I’d forgotten that song! "
I heard her movement off the ball was fantastic during her prime.
If its famous muslims wont pogba be the most famous?
"I think Ozil is more known as being muslim than other players, including Pogba"
Yes. His mecca photo did some proper rounds in the press..
