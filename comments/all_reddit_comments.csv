Hopefully Derek can come up with some answers about why Wenger is still in employment. Derek I want to die.
Reminded me to rewatch the show Derek. Thanks Derek Rae!
What a great voice he has
"Ahhh I'm in transit then so I might not be able to ask a question. 

Hope it's a good AMA regardless."
Top man for rescheduling it
Derek Bae
This guy is my nostalgia for CL commentary. Him and Tommy Smyt were my favorite commentators.
"Joshua Kimmich.

Yo shoo wa Kimikhh"
such a memorable voice
I wonder what he feels about ESPNFC since it went to shit when he left.
GET IN!!
Best voice in football.

Kroenke is shareholder in Arsenalfantv and need Wenger for the rants of the fans

"[The current quality of Bosnian Premier League pitches](https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/28280127_979797195512977_8668425811364771198_n.jpg?oh=c0495d766d36d323340eff6844ae8ff5&oe=5B08B3B8), outstanding.

The pitch quality led to this [hilariously stupid goal](https://streamable.com/70ltk) over the weekend. "
"I swear every players 'Wikipedia page has a 'style of play' section that makes them seem like an absolute monster. It's always

>X is known for being fast, strong, agile, hard-working and technically gifted. Despite his reputation as a creative player, X is famous for his clinical finishing and precise, powerful long shots. As well as being an attacker, X has shown great defensive ability, being able to regularly fill in in central defence.  Herbert Chapman, Julian Nagelsmenn and George Best also described X as 'the most naturally gifted goalkeeper [they] ever saw'

Then

>Career statistics: A PL Team (54 games 4 goals), A League 1 team (21 games 12 goals), A Championship side (68 games, 10 goals), A League 1 side (8games, 1 goal), A non league side (- games, - goals) and a load of loans in between where they score a goal every six games, bar one slightly impressive one."
"Club crest test

Edit- YAY"
"Unleashed an amazing shot with my left foot into the absolute top corner today, it honestly felt amazing. 

What are some of the other best feelings during a game?"
"I don’t know if this is already a thing or not, I can’t find anything with my rudimentary google searches, but does anyone else think that Premier League clubs should have to donate, say 5% of ticket revenue to a non-league club of their choosing every week?

Obviously there would have to be safeguarding to prevent any dodgy business with respect to players given to clubs in exchange for their continued support and what not, but I just feel with the growing levels of wealth in the premier league, it would be wise to be investing more heavily and regularly in the grass roots side of the game "
"It's just dawned on me that with Italy not qualifying for the World Cup, we are losing the best national anthem."
What do you normally eat during half-time?
"WC IS GETTING CLOSER

tell me your thoughts, predictions, whatever. Apparently Coman will miss the WC. Shame, always hard on a player. We're also not sure to get 100% Mendy back in time."
Funny how Arsenal are getting more stick for getting to the final then they would have if they got knocked out earlier
"It’s actually a bit sad what’s happened with  Wenger. Since Vieira left, year by year the decline has gradually chipped away at Wenger’s reputation. He’s refused to let go and eventually he’ll leave as a villain.

Should have stepped away years ago with his legacy intact "
I wondered why Bojan plays so rarely for Alavés. Anyone got an idea why? Is he injured or just bad?
"Predict Real Madrid's first choice starting XI at the start of the 2020/21 season. That's 3 summer transfer windows away. 

Very difficult of course, but just interested to see projections of how they'll cope I guess - You have the cases of Ronaldo being 35, Modric almost 35, difficult to tell whether Benzema, Navas and others last until then too, then the matter of whether Ceballos, Vallejo etc are ready yet.

edit: i might make a subreddit about predicting football 3 years in the future we can check back on in 3 years watch this space x"
"I’ve played with Alejandro Dominguez, Kiko Femenia, Thierry Henry, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and Patrick Vieira. 


Who am I?"
"What's the greatest footballing name, considering both first and surname? 

Luis Suarez? Both are quite decorated players within the game. The Luis Suarez of the 20th century even won a Balon Dor 

Edit: bad phrasing on my part. I didn't mean what names sound cool or anything.  More like an instance of at least two players with the exact same name and both being relatively good at football. Like the Suarez's"
"I see a lot of Americans doing some mental gymnastics to justify their supporting of European clubs. Honestly, why do you care?

I have an MLS team's stadium within 10 miles of my house (SJ Earthquakes), but I can't name 3 players from their squad if I tried. I've driven past their stadium(s) multiple times, yet never gone inside. I probably wouldn't mind going to a game, but none of my friends like soccer and won't attend a game with me.

On TV, I'd much rather watch Chelsea games, big team PL games and CL games than any MLS game, simply because the players are superstars and the football is much more intense and has a ""high-stakes"" feel to it. I recognize it for what it is, and I don't care. Football is just a form of entertainment for me. 

Why would any Americans bother with the mental gymnastics to justify their support is beyond me. Just own it. You find European soccer more entertaining and the MLS is kinda boring. Nothing wrong with that.

It's the same with basketball for me. I only recently started watching the sport and I make semi-regular trips to Oracle Arena with friends despite the outrageous ticket prices (regularly over $200) and the ridiculous traffic to watch Steph, KD and co. tear shit up. If the Warriors were a shit team, I probably wouldn't give a shit about basketball either."
"Dortmund fans, how has Zagadou been?"
Would it have been better for Arsenal to have been knocked out in the semis by chelsea by a respectable scoreline (say 2-1) to avoid the criticism they're getting now? 
"Since bayern became 1st 3 months ago, the second team hasn't won a match"
Does anyone else get annoyed when there is a blatantly bias guest on a football podcast?
"https://streamja.com/Awn


Can you imagine someone like Simeone’s reaction if Mustafi gets tapped and throws his hands up in the air like that? He’d leave in a stretcher. Wenger probably gave him some warm milk and rubbed his head after the match. "

               "
I actually think United winning was the best result for us. Now we have a 4 point gap between us and 5th and we can overtake United in a few weeks anyway. 
Not trying to whine but the inherent dislike for and feelings of superiority over Americans by some people on this sub is just weird. It doesn’t really offend me but I just don’t understand it. Can anyone explain?
Please tell me I’m not the only one who hates Alexi Lalas with a passion
"Sometimes I feel sorry for Americans. Basketball is a good sport, but baseball? American football? Yikes."
Got a PAOK jersey for my Away Day mystery kit. Wore it to the gym and had a weird fear that a well meaning Greek lad would recognize it and assume I knew about Greek football and I’d have to awkwardly explain I just bought something random because the internet made it seem cool. 
Who is the biggest team in each relevant Latin American League?
"Why are players given up on so early in soccer/football? 

Not trying to compare to an American sport, just using them as examples to get clarification, but over here players are considered projects and still judged mostly on potential all the way up until around 24 years of age. In European football, it seems like if a player isn't bagging goals or pocketing Ronaldo by 20 he's tossed aside.Why is that? "
"Let's say you're not Gareth Southgate or the FA, and you're gonna pick the most 'adventurous' England starting 11 eleven, regardless of current form or club-status, who would get the nod for you?

I'm thinking the likes of Shelvy, Lascelles, Oxford, Cook etc.

We're not gonna win anything, but, for once, i'd just like to be able to watch an England side playing like they're having fun (e.g. Euro '96)."
How was Leonardo's time as a manager for Antalyaspor?
I am scared about the final standings for the top 4. As of now we are 2 points behind Spurs and 4 behind Liverpool. We face City this weekend whilst Spurs and Liverpool face easily winnable games. This means that we are likely to be looking at a 5 point gap from safety with 9 games left including both Spurs and Liverpool. These following 10 games could have far reaching consequences especially with the Hazard and T-BO rumours. Hell at this point I wouldnt mind if we lost to Barca so we can put all our resources into securing UCL next year.
"What do you guys think of these teams in a Premier League all-star game? London vs. North West of England.

Top 6 clash: London vs. North West England

**LONDON**

Courtois

Trippier - Alderweireld - Vertonghen - Alonso

Dembele - Kante

Mkhitaryan - Özil - Hazard

Kane

**NORTHWEST**

De Gea

Walker - Otamendi - Bailly - Mendy

Pogba - Fernandinho - De Bruyne

Salah - Agüero - Mane

I think it'd be even across. London better in defense, North West better in attack."
Liverpool have been playing without a great midfield for a while now. How many points would a great midfield get us? 
[deleted]
Will Wenger stay beyond this season? He's a club legend but it's obvious he's not taking them anywhere and I'd love to see them rise up again. 
"are there any clubs who had real ""star""-co trainers?"
"Matip is underrated. His defending hasn’t been any special but his passing has created a few goals. We don’t need a ‘special defence’ against the likes of West Ham, Southampton etc. "
"Reus is back

RESURRECTION!!"
"PL goal per minute rate 

Firmino (not a striker so unfair) 157 min per goal

Morata 164 min per goal

Lukaku 180 min per goal

Interesting stat due to the new narrative developing which is Lukaku is better than Morata and Chelsea fucked up

Morata is being judged unfairly. He’s been injured for a while and is getting accustomed to a new league. "
"Do you think the Persian League is on par with the MLS? Because a user thinks it is, won't name which. I would think not tbh, call bias, but our league has better talents, players, structure, wages, atmosphere as well. just because iran qualified for two world cups cant immediately change that. curious to hear other opinions"

Going in for a challenge and just taking the ball cleanly. Just feels so good
I remember saving 4 out of 5 in a penalty shoot out in a cup final when i was 15. Probably the best feeling i have ever had. 
"The long through ball behind a defender.

Nothing feels better to me than releasing a striker and just leaving it all to them."
Last ditch tackle to an open goal
"Catching a volley just right. Barely even have to put power into it.

Controlling a high ball perfectly on your foot. 

"
i had one goal line clearance during offseason. made me feel 10 feet tall
Being apart of a move to break down a team that is amazing defensively. We played a team who we were dominating everywhere but goals. Their keeper was insane and we didn't score until 1 min before a half I did a mini run passed it to my roommate who slammed it to the top rights 
Saving a penalty at the end of a game
Nutmeg 
Every time I Dribble more than 2 players and my friends start gassing me up. It's a better feeling when strangers start doing it.
Pinched the ball from the striker near the halfway line. Did a solo run and slotted the ball at the near post. Did against the ladder leaders. Best feeling. 
90th minute winner in a really important game!
"From a personal point of view, I like holding the ball up in the box then swivelling and putting it in the bottom corner with the keeper blindsided."
"Catching a volley perfectly and watching it fly into the roof of the net to win the match.

I was pumping with adrenaline running about like a madman after. Don’t think I’ll ever be able to replicate that feeling, "
"Did a last ditch tackle, inside my box after sprinting from the oppositions box after taking s corner. Don’t think I’ve ever ran so fast and put all my momentum into the tackle and just nicked it before he shot. Got a few pats on the back after from the defenders. Felt like a goal.

Defence splitting pass. Preferably on the ground, onto a pacy winger or striker. Also nutmegs and for some reason I get mad adrenaline when I hit the woodwork. "
"playing multiple tiki taka passes with the same person, even excessively at times"
"Personally, doing a small body feint and moving the ball ever so slightly at the last moment and getting absolutely fucking clattered by the poor cunt who genuinely thought he was going to get he ball until you decided to get him a yellow at your own risk. Makes you feel like Messi when if you tried to do that in professional football you would end up dispossed, broken, and with the club president standing over your stretcher ripping your contract in your face.

Either that or a goal line clearance."
Picking up the ball in space and going on a run with it past multiple players
"Dribbling through a whole team and scoring in futsal

Bonus points for nutmeg"
"That’s partly why the Premier League was created. The big 5 at the time (United, Everton, Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal) decided that they wanted to play in a league where revenue from TV wasn’t split between all divisions and they wanted to be in a league where only the teams active in it got money from being on TV. "
"A contribution to a pool of cash, which then gets dispersed between lower league/non-league teams wouldn't be a bad idea at all - don't think allowing clubs to choose to give money to specific teams would go well though.

You'd have the dodgy business you've already mentioned, but you'd also end up creating a huge divide at non-league level. Some small clubs would have 'sugar-daddy' Prem clubs, and United giving their matchday revenue to a non-league club would give them an absolutely huge advantage over their competitors, who might get nothing, or get a share of, say, Bournemouth's small matchday take.

"
"There was a post here a while ago about how PL wages play a part in non-league pension schemes. I can’t remember the exact figure, but it’s something like 1% of wages go into a pension pool across the PFA. It was a nice touch I wasn’t aware of. "

"M‘bappe could be your future record WC goalscorer. In 16 years he‘ll be 35 and probably be playing his 4th or 5th WC, your current recordholder is Fontaine with 13 goals.

Also Müller has 10 goals, all time recordholder is Klose with 16. If Müller manages to score 7 in Russia and Qatar combined he should be the new recordholder"
"I think Messi will win Argentina the WC finally. They were terrible in qualifying, but to be fair Sampaoli took over with 4 games left of the qualification. He is a fantastic coach and will have had a year with the team when the tournament kicks off. There are exciting players to finally challenge the old guard. Icardi, Dybala, the two Corres, Acuna etc. The defense also looks much better than in 2014 with Otamendi, Garay, Fazio, Rojo, Mercado. I think people are badly underestimating them

"I think it's not outside Australia's capabilities to get to the round of 16. I'm optimistic about Bert (our new manager) and while Denmark will be tough, it might go down to who gets smashed by France the least."
"Who will replace Mendy? Kurzawa or Digne I would guess, but that's a bit underwhelming to be honest. Do Roussillon or Ferland Mendy have a chance of being called up? "
Mendy will be back in a couple weeks hopefully 
"They played so bad though, had they lost 1-0 and put up a fight then they would have probably been praised"
"Yeah but the main reason they are getting stick is because everyone wanted them to go and play their hearts out in the final, but than they just looked like they never really believed they would beat City especially after the first goal."
"It’s the arsenal meme that’s been going around. If any other team had played that shit, it would have been ascribed to City being amazing and the losing team simply not playing well.

It’s just because arsenal have been playing like shit for so long that it’s slowly become funny when they lose. "
I don't really understand why he keeps going. The FA Cup win against Chelsea was the perfect way to end it. 
"Imagine if he went to Real Madrid around 2006 or 2007 like he was rumoured too, he would have certainly got more time than some of the Real Madrid managers around that time."
"I can see why he doesn't want to leave. It's been his life for over 2 decades now, I'd imagine it's hard to let go of that. I agree with you, as great as he's been, and as impressive as his loyalty to Arsenal is, he's past his prime as a manager. But I get why it's hard for him to let go. The FA Cup win over Chelsea would've been a good way to end it gracefully. "

"I think that Americans feel the need to explain their support because many people on this sub will offend them, saying that they’re not real fans, etc. They want to be accepted, which I don’t think is necessary, but I can see why some would do that. 

But honestly, this has been discussed so many times that it’s become kinda boring."
"> I probably wouldn't mind going to a game, but none of my friends like soccer and won't attend a game with me.

I get your points, but I'd really recommend going to a local game if you can. The atmosphere and sense of locality and comradery will more than make up for the lower standard of football and, lets be real here, Chelsea haven't exactly been tearing shit up this year."
"Do you *need* to support Chelsea though? What was it about Chelsea that made you pick that team to follow? Or Americans to pick any foreign team to support?

What I mean is, I still watch top Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Champions League games because I like watching great football but I dont support any of them. You *can* just like football."
so youre a fair weather fan and a bandwagon fan. nice.
"He's been outstanding, looks really good on the ball."
From the few games I’ve seen he’s been pretty shite defensively 
"Nope, always better to make it to a cup final in my eyes "
"The best time to lose in the League cup is the third round with a heavily rotated side. Making it to the semi-final only to lose after two legs would be the most pointless thing ever, especially as it would clog up your fixtures."
Didn’t Dortmund win last week? 
Simeone must really be quite a hard boss to work for tbh. He also always looks angry/disappointed. The guy scares me and seems like a nightmare of a boss but cant hate too hard. Hes done wonders with Atletico. I dont think theres a better defensive team in the world right now. 
What is he honestly expecting from that? He runs into him. There’s no way it’s a foul. 
"I assume 4-2-3-1 Neuer - Kimmich, Boateng, Hummels, Hector - Kroos, Khedira - Müller, Özil, Reus - Werner

Edit:  Maybe Gundogan instead of Khedira."
So La liga is basically better in every position (except gk where its pretty equal).
It would be incredible to see those teams match up against eachother. Shame it'll never happen.
"Yeah I would agree...just getting CL is much more important than who gets 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Yeah I would like to finish 2nd(especially above Liverpool) but if it comes down to it and we are safe from 5th place, I wouldn't be upset if we put less focus on PL to fight more on obtaining the FA cup or for a farther run in the Champions League."
With how Arsenal has been playing don't count on that. United haven't exactly been killer but they've been better than Arsenal. 
"A draw was better just because the United fans would be quiet with the ""we are still second"" talk for at least a week but a United win isn't so bad. "
"I think a lot of it is due to football fans not liking casual fans, which on this sub is largely represented by Americans "
[Hmmm...](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/80dzhm/that_is_how_you_defense/duuuoe8/?st=je4rylda&sh=e933f94c)
There's also hate for SA clubs.
"It's mainly because they're seen as plastics or gloryhunters. Also because America is generally disliked due to ideological reasons in this sub; Trump, racism, guns and capitalism are some of the first things that come to mind when I think about the US."
"An American can never truly appreciate a rivalry, because rivalries are often based on location, and Americans tend to, ya know, live on the other side of the damn earth.

An American can never truly appreciate a win by the team they love, because they haven't been utterly surrounded by it through their childhood. Ever since I was young I supported Porto. I was born a Porto fan and I'll die one. I didn't just catch one of their games on TV once and say ""Hey, I really like their blue kits. Guess I'm a Porto fan now!"" like a lot of American fans proudly claim doing, only it's most often Barça, Real or Liverpool or United, or whatever top 15 team in the world.

It's the worst kind of support, tbh. Between having a million of American fans or 40,000 fans from Porto, I'd happily take the fans from Porto.

As others have mentioned, it's the same with other nationalities for me. It's just Americans tend to do it more often, and be more obnoxious about it."
"From what I see with a lot of the anti-American comments  it seems like people on this sub associate Americans with the cringey ""classy fan"" and ""clearly bases their opinions off of the FIFA games"" groups than users of other nationalities. How accurate that is is up to your discretion."
"In my experience it goes beyond Americans. There are lots of people on this sub who inherently dislike and feel superior over Americans, Indians, Arabs, Africans etc. basically non-Europeans (and mayybe non-South Americans). These countries (or countries in those continents) don't have a ""football culture"" according to them. 

It's most visible against Americans because they're the largest demographic on this sub."
Most Americans are hypocrites. That’s what irks me about them 
"Considering how many times I have seen the same comment here, I'd say no you aren't the only one. "
"Yep, just you who dislikes that pundit who everyone always talks about disliking!"
I don't know anything about the MLS and I still know that he isn't very liked.
I think you’ll find it hard to find someone who actually likes him. It’s like he bases his opinion off fifa stats. 
I don't think I've met anyone who likes him
Not sure why you feel bad for them ? There are Americans who enjoy those sports 
North Americans*
"Baseball games are fun to attend but boring to watch on tv. American football is fascinating, but I guess it’s not for everyone. "
"Baseball is fun. Just sit back, relax and watch a game with some beers. "
"Basketball is obviously cool to watch on TV, but I watched American Football last year in Dublin and it was excellent. Obviously, the constant interruptions hurt the flow of the game on the television. "
I honestly can't watch any other sport than football. love tennis too actually but the rest is so boring imo.
"Personally, I think baseball is the most likable of the American sports. It is obvious that it's all about having food and beer in the stands and having a day out with your family and friends, and doesn't really pretend to be a serious sport. Also, it often features just a few, crucial highlights that determine the outcome of the game, a bit like football. American football is the worst."
"As a European I really love Basketball. The whole parity thing is a bit of a joke but I started getting interest in the NBA through /r/nba and it's a fun sub to follow. After waking up I usually just go there and see what happened in the games over the night. 
  
I will never understand a few things about American sports culture and the fact that there are so many breaks is annoying (compared to footie it's a culture shock) but I like it. "
"Baseball is my favorite sport, and I'm not even american, what are you talking about?"
From a distance it would look similar to a Newcastle or Juventus shirt. Are there a lot of Greek people where you are?
"It depends on how you define biggest.

Most league titles? Most important titles? Titles across a longer span? Are recent titles worth more or less than older titles? Best performance overall, not necessarily resulting in titles?

Football in South America is much more volatile than Europe, because the best players rarely stay for more than a few years, so it's hard for a club to consistently stay on top.

The club with most league titles in Brazil has already been relegated, as well as many other clubs considered big.

There are clubs that were big in the 70s and 80s but now are bankrupt and some even extinct, and there are clubs that come out of nowhere and win the league or even international titles.

That's why it's impossible to define just one team in each country as the biggest. Different people will have different opinions on what being a big club means"

"The margins are much thinner in a promotion/relegation system. If a young player has a hard time, you can't afford to keep carrying him to develop him if you're either pushing to go up or looking over your shoulder at the drop."
"The Stakes are much higher in football. In the NBA, for example, you can't get relegated but in football one bad season can ruin your next few years easily. Also, the pool of selection is a lot bigger in football so if you stick too long you might miss on someone better. "
More supply of talent cause more than one country takes it serious mostly
"It’s worth noting that American sports (on average) have significantly more games per season. If you’re a baseball or NBA player, you’ve got a lot more chances to prove yourself as opposed to football. NFL has less games, but more game time so I’d count that in there too. "
Soccer players peak earlier because fitness is a greater factor than in American sports with stoppage of play.  
A 24 year old player is near on his prime. Not too many players develop a lot after this age.
Anyone picking Shelvey would be mad. Oxford has started 17 senior games in his life. How on Earth would he be anywhere near the England team?
"What do you mean by adventurous? This is definitely an alternative XI anyway

Heaton; Lascelles, Rice, Oxford; Chamberlain, Shelvey, Cook, Albrighton; Gray, Sancho, Sessegnon. 

Would get solidly thrashed "
Not sure losing by 3 goals every match qualifies as having fun.
"If I were going for a slightly altered XI featuring young players who've really impressed me (but for a lack of experience), I'd go with: Pickford; Gomez, Stones, Maguire; Walker, Sessegnon; Winks, Loftus-Cheek; Alli, Sterling, Kane."
"> at this point I wouldnt mind if we lost to Barca

me neither"
"I hope we get 83 points. In our team remaining games last season we were unbeaten in them and won 8/10. I doubt we’ll match that though.

Chelsea’s fixtures are harder, game against City Tottenham Liverpool and also there’s no guarantee you’ll beat the lower teams as you’ve lost 6 games to lower opposition this season. 

On your TBO and Hazard point. TBO is definitely off I feel. Probably to ATM because of the situation with his kids and that Oblak is most likely going to attract PSG/Real etc. Also he only has 1 year remaining and I doubt the Chelsea board will let him go for free the next season. I think Hazard will stay an extra year because he’ll be too expensive and is 27. But who knows.

On your future it depends if you get CL or not (which seems unlikely) and if your board are willing to spend big this summer even with the new stadium plans. "
Silva > Pogba and Robbo > Mendy since Mendy has been out for so long 
"Van Dijk goes in that defence one way or another

Also Robertson on current form, Aguero is the better striker but it's sort of a crime having those two without the glue that keeps them together

Just my biased opinion"
"> Mkhitaryan - Özil 

Wtf...

Eriksen > Ozil anyday this season, and Willian over Mkhitaryan for sure. No Arsenal player makes it into the London XI atm."

"Sadly, I think yes. There's no way he'll get sacked. He will be here for the rest of his two years"
*REUSrection
"... is he though?

Failing to beat Augsburg is pretty embarrassing"
He's been like that for the last couple of games right now though.....
What is Firmino then if he’s not a striker? Midfielder playing up front? 
Hopefully not 
"Kind of, he left early (18) which is why he became a good player. If he stayed he'd probably be playing in the Regionalliga now"
Do you think players go in there and edit their own wikipedia pages? It's an interesting theory.
I haven't :(
Thankyou! Think you lot will stay up this season?
"That must feel great. I'm shit at defending and all I end up doing is kicking their shins, but I always get frustrated when the ball gets taken off me"
Intercepting a dangerous pass is the best feeling for me.

"Having an amazing goalkeeper in your team is a great feeling, sometimes you start thinking that being called a ""wall"" isn't so much as hyperbole as it is the truth..."
"Well, if the striker is a moron who either gently passes the ball to the goalie or tries to kill someone in the nonexistent stand with a fucking rocket, it's not as fun. "
Agree on the volley. You just know it's going to be amazing as soon as it leaves your foot.
"I love playing pinpoint through passes, it so pleasing to have your teammate be at the receiving end at one"
It’s always better when followed by a successful through pass. 
Hearing the “ooohhoh” then a few claps makes ya feel like Messi.
"Yeah very good point, this would work much better! "

Well maybe we multi-task better here.
Classic.

You're absolutely correct.
"Yes, this one I can actually see happening."

I hope he never had to play against Rod Fanni.
"It's definitely more fun when you have a team to support, at least for me. "
Yeah maybe I am. Don't really care either way. Don't see why anyone would feel the need to care about being labelled as such.
Whaaat? He's very solid for 18 years 
Schalke were technically in 2nd because they played the day before.
"I don't think he would be a scary guy, more a passionate manager. You can tell how much he would give for the club and he would do everything he can to make his players better for the sake of the club. If he scared all the players and was a hard boss, people wouldn't love him like they do at Atleti"
Obviously it’s not a foul but Aguero definitely nudges him in the back and I’ve noticed this season that pushes in the back of defenders have been penalised quite strictly. I think it’s a lot closer to a foul than people say on here 
I can see how he feels contact and thinks “oh he’s impeding me” but it’s genuinely the softest contact of all time and no referee in history would call it.
"Never liked Gündogan when he played for our NT. I think Goretzka will take that spot sooner or later, probably sooner "
"For me there are a lot of comparable positions. De Gea, Alderweireld, Mendy, KDB and Kane are at a very similar level to their la liga counterparts imo. The biggest difference is Messi who is basically Salah and Hazard combined.

Even without Messi, like lets say Griezmann, I still think La liga would win but it would be a decent game. Both these teams would be big favorites for the champions league and it would be an amazing game to watch. "
What does Arsenal have to do with this?
"What exactly is your issue with United fans pointing out they're still second in regards to criticisms of their season?

I'm sure if Liverpool had been 2nd, you would have done the same with regards to criticisms of your defence."

"I can’t understand this at all, while Trump is clearly an idiot, America isn’t the only country to have suffered from the idiotic voting of right wingers recently. Just take a look at Britain. Racism is everywhere, and I could argue that the inherent hate and superiority complex of others over Americans could be seen as something similar to racism. Nobody really hates capitalism that much, and the United Kingdom is capitalist so that doesn’t make much sense."
"> An American can never truly appreciate a rivalry, because rivalries are often based on location, and Americans tend to, ya know, live on the other side of the damn earth.

A good example would be when some Barca fans wanting the club to rest players against Espanyol so they can be fresh for a Champions League group stage match.  Like Christ, somebody that doesn't live in Barcelona doesn't understand that you're gonna be hearing shit for weeks from Espanyol fans at work/school if they were to beat Barca."
"So what’s the difference between someone from Sweden supporting Chelsea and someone from America supporting Chelsea?

I’ve not once seen anyone besides an American get called out for “glory-hunting”."
"I can see your point and I understand how it could be annoying, but I also think it’s important to understand it from an Americans point of view. For most people who are now in their late teens or early 20s, the MLS was completely shit when they were growing up. Also a lot of Americans wouldn’t have had parents who took them out to local club soccer games, so they never got the chance to see a team play, other than the English/Spanish teams they saw on TV. I’m not saying that American fans understand local rivalries as well as local fans, but I do think we have the ability to love the club just as much as local fans. I would definitely say that I love Liverpool just as much as any English person."
its not only americans though. there are other foreigners who support plastic teams as well
Spot on 
"Well how is it the American persons fault that they were born on the other side of the earth? If they want to support a team, then the only option they have besides the MLS, is the bigger clubs you mentioned since those are the ones most often talked about in the media "
"I think this is basically the answer. I like to watch the NBA as an European, just like Americans like to watch European football. I like the Pacers because why not, I hate bandwagons. However, I don't lurk on /r/nba sharing my hatred towards the Knicks just because they're rival teams, it makes no sense, I'm not part of them, I don't understand the American culture and don't understand that rivalry. 

What you see in /r/soccer is a bunch of non-spanish Real Madrid and Barça fans fighting because ""hurr durr we are part of the teams"". It's stupid, a week ago you were watching your first game, now you're arguing with people over why your team is better than your rival. It's not just Americans, that's for sure."

Not nearly as popular as the other two I named
what does this mean
I went to see the Mets when I visited New York last summer. I couldn't fully grasp what was going on at first due to the abundance of jargon however the hardest part was having to sit there for an absurdly long time. It's quite difficult to recall because I was periodically dozing off but I swear we must have been there for about 3 hours. We got arrived in the blazing sun and left after dark anyway. Nuts. I enjoyed the grease-laden food and beer though.
"Tbf, if you’ve never been, you wouldn’t get how the interruptions are actually super entertaining in the stadium. I went to an NBA game and every stoppage had some combination of cheerleaders, a mascot, a T-shirt canon, a blimp, free throw competitions, kiss cams, singalongs. Much better than football where you’re just sat there queueing for a piss or reading a programme. "
I like American football too but the fact that all of these guys have brain damage makes me a bit uncomfortable. 
Although I suppose it's not technically a sport F1 baffles me the most. The first 30 seconds are alright but then the finishing positions are pretty much nailed on and the race lasts what seems like an eternity. 
I can watch anything. My only qualm with a lot of sports is that a match takes too long for me that I'm used to 1h30m
I can go for football and rugby but that's it
"I enjoy watching rugby, and cricket is pretty fun live because you can do other stuff at the same time without missing much.
"
"Yeah. Tennis is amazing, as well as a few Olympic sports but the rest is quite boring"
Football is the one true ~~sport~~ god
I'm genuinely curious why that is. 24 in sports here is like mid to late-mid development age. Prime years are between 26-31 give or take depending on the sport. 
"> Van Dijk goes in that defence one way or another

He really doesn't."
"I'd agree on the Eriksen bit, one of the three best central playmakers in the League this season alongside KDB and Coutinho IMO (not counting Hazard here). I just didn't want to pick too many of any one club."
Haha I've just been seeing more and more reports that arsenal want him gone when the season ends
REUSerection
Inverted deep-lying reverse false 8.
Pretty much. If you watch him in game he’s actually more of a creator. Drops deep to pick up the ball. Free roams everywhere. No one would call Messi a striker. False 9 is the right term. Salah is more of striker than him I’d say. 
I can't be the only one surely. What newspapers do you guys read?
"Dinamo sent Modrić on loan to the Bosnian league when he was 18 to toughen up, safe to say it was successful"
"I use the rule of thumb that if a L1 or lower player has a bio that looks like a PR company wrote it, it's probably written by themselves. "
"Am I confident we can stay up? Of course.

If I had to put money on it. I would say like 65%. We are bouncy and either play really well or just historically bad and as long as we can find some consistency. Avoid home losses primarily, I am sure we can do it.

We just are weak in the striker position and McDonald hasn't really been performing so hot and it just is putting a lot of pressure on Taylor and Barcham to perform as Pigott is just getting into swing with the squad."
Exactly. Because if you know how your teammates play you can play some tikitaka and stuff
Or sometimes when the successful through pass goes through a defender's legs and they have no idea about it
You have some polite people around you lol.
Just get us a sausage sizzle and we're in business
"Nah mate, we were pretty fucking sloppy yesterday. Shocking that Arsenal just couldn't do, well, anything."
Just because you did well last season doesn't give you an excuse to play that shit yesterday.
Yh nah. I’ve seen a lot of teams perform better against City than they did. Shocking performance. 
He probably loves the club too much to end it himself. The thing is I am not sure Arsenal would do any better next season even if he leaves. The players are too arrogant to even care at this point.  
"That was really hard, good one"
lol yea no idea how to
"Middle name: Dódgi

Rod Dódgi Fanni"
"Yeh fair do's.

I always just wonder about what makes people pick teams to support from elsewhere, whether one day they just throw a dart to decide *""thats the team im going to support!""* or if they have been watching football for a few years and eventually gravitate to liking one team more than any other. The first one seems like a bit of a weird thing to me."
"i mean as someone from the bay i wish you would fuck off and not all of a sudden drop $200 on tickets to see the dubs, youre part of the problem. not only are you supporting and legitimizing the horribly inflated resale market and general raising of tickets (which will for sure continue when they move to the city) but youre also taking up seats from people who have supported the team for years, especially during those dark years. of course the obvious response is that its a free country, free market, capitalism, etc etc but thats just my view of it. and honestly you can draw a lot of parallels to the ideologies of a lot of the european supporters on this sub and those attending the games of the teams we support who have protested successfully over ticket prices in europe and harbor similar views on day trippers and tourists. "
He doesn’t even impede him though. Aguero stands his ground and waits for the ball whilst he backs into him. Anyone who thinks that’s a foul needs their head checking. What’s Aguero supposed to do in that situation?
Marcelo definitely better than Mendy imo
Mendy is not at similar level to Marcelo.
The username of the comment I replied to. Honestly thought he was referring to the Gunners. I haven't looked at the table in a while so I thought that that's what it was. Brain fart on my part. 
"Because our defence is actually good for the past few months. Majority of our goals conceded have been down to individual errors but our defensive system is one of the best in Europe.

And us being in 2nd wouldn’t have meant that people’s perception of our defence would change. They’d just say ‘ahh but imagine Liverpool with a good defence, they’d be challenging’. 

United fans use the ‘but were second’ excuse for their awful brand of football and to say they are a better team than Liverpool & Tottenham "
"They don’t go to games is the biggest difference I’d say. They also typically are newer fans, so they don’t know as much as people who’ve been watching since before they could walk "
"> I could argue that the inherent hate and superiority complex of others over Americans could be seen as something similar to racism.

I think that's taking it a bit far."
"There's obviously a lot of racism in England but I'd say that, even though it's probably not worse in the US, the problem is a bit deeper (police brutality against African-Americans, America's obsession with race etc.). As for capitalism, I've seen many people make fun of the ad culture around American football and the Superbowl. I think it's not that the US is really that bad, but that it has many of biggest first world problems times 100."
"> some Barca fans wanting the club to rest players against Espanyol so they can be fresh for a Champions League group stage match

Fuck that, I want us to smash those little shits"
Both of them are annoying. I don't have anything against Americans especially.
"I've got to say you're right, it's a pretty pervasive and annoying double-standard that OP might not have, but is definitely popular here.  Americans get shit on pretty regularly for supporting Arsenal but the die-hard Bulgarian Chelsea supporter gets generally zero shit here.  "
"> I can see your point and I understand how it could be annoying, but I also think it’s important to understand it from an Americans point of view. For most people who are now in their late teens or early 20s, the MLS was completely shit when they were growing up. 

It took until 1977 for Porto be a great club. Do you think until then everyone from Porto was a Benfica fan, because they were the ones winning? Hell no, you were from Porto, you supported Porto, no matter how garbage they were playing.

> Also a lot of Americans wouldn’t have had parents who took them out to local club soccer games, so they never got the chance to see a team play, other than the English/Spanish teams they saw on TV. 

That's not a very good excuse.



"
They're even worse. America and Australia are massive and loads of people don't have clubs near them but if you're from Norfolk and your supporting United then you need to be taking out back and put down.
"> Well how is it the American persons fault that they were born on the other side of the earth?

It's not. They got dealt a shitty hand. They still have clubs in their state, or near their state, at least. The MLS is growing, and it needs support. Not a bunch of ""fans"" who'd rather watch Liverpool - Everton and act like it's a rivalry that's at all relevant to them.

> If they want to support a team, then the only option they have besides the MLS

Yes, and if I wanted to completely ignore my own league, I could also just claim to be the biggest Barça fan to ever exist. It would also be incredibly pathetic.

"
"Tbh NBA rivalries are not as historic and intense as European rivalries, which have long political and cultural histories (like Celtic-Rangers, Liverpool-United, Real-Barca etc). NBA rivalries are more recent and superficial. 

For eg. The Warriors-Cavaliers rivalry is heated, but only because they've met multiple times in finals recently and those games have gotten heated.

NBA rivalries are more like the Chelsea-United rivalry. Not really any cultural or political history, just two recently successful teams who've had tight battles in recent years."
I see a lot of mocking of the African commenters on PL Facebook pages here.
yeah but they bandwagon oh so much
I’ve talked to a lot of Americans who completely dismiss any notions that their countries wars have made the world a worse place. For example I once had an argument with an American who was complaining about the Middle East governments etc which I agree with however he did it an elitist and degrading manner. I then said to him but what about your government and he said with a straight face ‘America represents freedom’... he was upset when I brought up Iraq etc and said that American democracy is overrated. But hey ho America is freedom 
Us brits are the biggest self haters. 
Try and succeed.
What?
"North America is comprised of Canada, The United States of America, and Mexico (and Greenland, I guess) -- if you're going by NAFTA members.

I'm guessing the OP is trying to differentiate South America and perhaps Central America/Caribbean from these countries due to cultural differences, but is being kind of pedantic as most of the time American refers to the USA as it is cumbersome to refer to citizens of the USA as anything else (USAians?) and there are good terms for most citizens of other countries/continents.
"
"Yeah, there was a lot of shit going on after each quarter, and I generally used timeouts or whatever you call them as piss breaks. The beer helped too."
"It's been a lot better lately, they loosened up the rules and positions switch a lot. They take many risks."
Finishing positions are not nailed on depending on the race. 
I've not been watching it since schumacher's retirement but back then it was fun. 
"if it wasn't for the goddamn commercials they would be very watchable. Or ridiculous things like ""TV timeouts"". Like wtf you actually stop a game for a fucking commercial? "
"They look like fake sports to me. i mean let's say american football. it looks so synthetical to me. bunch of men wearing helmets throwing egg shaped ball to each other. i mean imo a sport should rely on pure talent. we can see the talent while watching coman for example. you can feel that you have to have more than some muscles. you have to born with the talent to be a professional footballer but when i watch american football, it's based on how muscular, strong you are. and a little bit fast and good at catching an egg shaped ball naaah not for me."
"I think it may also have to do with youth infrastructure. Star footballers often start playing for top clubs while they're still teenagers, whereas don't basically all American sportsmen have to go through college before they can be considered?"
Is that in American sports or football in America?
He does. The only reason VVD hasn’t been the best CB in the league was injury. Not sure how Bailly gets in while missing the majority of the season 
"Wtf are you on about, he's better than both Otamendi and and Bailly, the calmness that's in our defence now is amazing

Tells you something nobody's mentioned his price for 4 weeks now

He's better on the ball and stronger in the air than both of them"
"I wouldn't believe them entirely. That's what the fans want, so journos will write it for fans to pick up and buy"
"Presumably either good ones or none at all, because who under the age of 50 reads actual newspapers anymore?"
"Ah forgot you had Pigott! Absolutely love him after his Wembley heroics for us. Not living in England at the moment so try my best to keep up with all the league one and two stuff but it's hard without the football league show haha! Luckily we've turned our season around in the last 5 games and looking good for a solid mid-table finish, if we really push on then we could maybe get 8th-ish, will need a miracle for that 6th spot."
"yes, especially this"
Usually old men.
"An old fat guy who plays with us in Sunday league was once an Arsenal prospect. Fucked his knees really young and the dream was gone, but his quality on the ball is still there. He just ambles around at his own pace, occasionally flicking a masterful through ball here or there whenever he feels like it.

He would fit right into this Arsenal team"
"true but they've won the last 3 finals they've played in, I think? which is quite impressive"
"They won't imo players like Wilshere and Ramsey really haven't paid back the faith Wenger put in them , he's protected the players too much I think he got too comfortable with top 4 and he's been to stubborn in the market Fergie was similar and not working with Raiola and falling out with Mendes cost utd "
"At this point I feel like the Arsenal board wouldn't outright sack him, they'd basically come to an agreement behind closed doors to very strongly encourage him to retire."
"I can give you another point of view. I am from Aus, the A-league had minimal coverage when I started to invest properly into football. The EPL was constantly on TV, so I started to watch and Chelsea was the team that interested me the most. Terry quickly became my favourite player because I play as a CB. "
"Most people either slowly gravitate towards a club or they grew up with it in some fashion. My dad was a fisherman and was a lot away from home when i was a kid. He loves Liverpool. So whenever he was home we played football together in the yard and we watched football on TV. It was like our bonding father/son thing. So now we go to Anfield together a couple of times a year etc. He bought me kits, got me bed sheets and taught me about the legends. 

I guess i am not a local since i don't have that connection, but i am very emotionally invested and i love the club. And does that really make me less of a fan? Idk.

I use my Bodø/Glimt flair because even though the club is 5 hours away by boat its pretty much the closest club to me and i love feeling like a snowflake.  I follow my local team but it doesn't really get close to Liverpool because i grew up with it. 

Some people think it's lame, but i honestly wouldn't trade it for anything. "
"You really think I willingly pay $200 or more? Of course I recognize it for the eye-gouging it is, but attending games is fun, especially with company, so I grudgingly fork over the cash. 

The arena is almost always filled up whenever I go, so I'm far from the only one paying those prices and ""taking up seats from people who have supported the team for years"""
">”I can see how he *thinks* oh he’s impeding me”




>*thinks*"
I don't think there's a lot between them imo
"Marcelo was the best left back in the world last season, but Mendy was excellent for Monaco and started this season in incredible form. It's unfortunate that he got injured, but lets not forget how awful both Marcelo and Carvajal have been this season. If both are fully fit I really don't think there is much in it."
">our defensive system is one of the best in Europe.

Your defensive system is one of the best in Europe?

>United fans use the ‘but were second’ excuse for their awful brand of football and to say they are a better team than Liverpool & Tottenham

United have been above you all season, are you going to really claim Liverpool are better than them? The league table is objective and tangible evidence of team rankings. It doesn't really get much easier to differentiate between teams than that."
"> Majority of our goals conceded have been down to individual errors but our defensive system is one of the best in Europe.

Your defense being good for the last few months doesn't equate to you having one of the best defensive systems in Europe. 

Your defence is fine but nowhere near one of the best in Europe."
"No, we use it as an excuse for being 2nd. Which we are."
"Wigan have the best defensive record in England and we managed to beat City without conceding (a feat the mighty Liverpool defence couldn't manage). We must be one of the top defensive sides in Europe too. 

Go Wigan!"
Neither do most of the European fans here lmao 
"Yeah sorry I’m not saying it’s actually racism but blind and irrational dislike is a common factor in both. Once again, it’s clearly not racism."
"Fucking hilarious. The guy who supports the biggest club in his city calling others for being ""plastics"". 

Why aren't you supporting Salgueiros then? Or Academico? or Boavista? "
"How is that not a good excuse? 


If you’re growing up and the only teams you can watch are English/Spanish teams, you’re eventually going to become a fan of one of those teams. Once you’re older you should also support your local team, but that doesn’t mean you lose all of the love that you have for the foreign team."
"you sound like you're joking, but I agree. There is no excuse in the British Isles(plus Ireland etc) Theres like sooooooo many teams and each division/area has a team. no excuses. and its even worse to find these sorts of people grasping and trying to find ways to justify it. like stfu and follow your own advice on local teams "
"So Americans were born on the wrong side of the planet and now they can’t be appreciated as normal fans? The MLS is the laughing stock of this sub, it’s growing bigger these days but it’s been constantly shit on as a “fake league”. Most people here are in their late teens and early twenties anyways, so asking them to just ditch the international team they support and stick to MLS is just unrealistic. "
"I get it. I have nothing against Americans or whoever it is supporting European football teams, as I myself enjoy American sports. It only gets to my nerves when people pretend to be better because they support X team. Like when my friends act all good because they support the Cavs. Can't stand those"
"They're genuinely awful though. But that's not because they're African, that's just because they're facebook commentators and there's lots of them."
"oh no, yeah. people are assholes in this sub to anyone that isn't european (preferably english)"
Well if you’re basing your opinion about “most Americans” being hypocrites on one conversation about governments or whatever then that’s just plain wrong 
"You’ll find that a lot of Americans regret our entry into the Middle East.

Hypocrites are everywhere and it doesn’t make sense to dislike a country just because of a few people that you may have talked to disagreeing with you."
Good bot

Ahhh of course lol.
i literally said part of the problem. of course youre not the only one. doesnt really change anything though.
>Anyone who thinks that needs their head checking
"Our defensive system is yes. We concede the 6th least shots on target in the top 5 leagues in Europe. Our xGA in open play is one of the lowest. Most goals we concede are due to individual errors. (Mostly from Migs, Lovren, Gomez, Moreno)


>United have been above you all season, are you going to really claim Liverpool are better than them? 

This is exactly my point. We’ve been better for 3 months now. At one point we were 9 or so points behind United. Now we are 2 points behind. We have been better 
"
"Our defensive system is actually one of the best. Look at our xGA in open play. Our chances conceded in the box. Our shots on target conceded as well.

http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/rk/perf/en/phone/index.html

I know many of you hate expected stats and shots/chance conceded stats but it’s a good way of judging a defensive system. Just looking at goals conceded is stupid "
You are talking about a one off game. Either way we scored 4 against them. So ha
I doubt that tbh 
"> Fucking hilarious. The guy who supports the biggest club in his city calling others for being ""plastics"". 

Because I'm from V.N Gaia, you mong. Porto is one of the local clubs here.

> Why aren't you supporting Salgueiros then? Or Academico? or Boavista? 

Because I'm not from there?? I also support my very local team. "
"> How is that not a good excuse? 

You're not a teen anymore. You have the internet. You can literally google ""[INSERT STATE HERE] FC"" and get a result and start going to games.

"
I don't mind if they want to follow a prem team but atleast go and watch local football to help it grow and develop. The amount of cunts I see going and complaining about Irish football being crap or English football being crap who don't go and actually support it is astonishing.
"bro you genuinely piss me off so much. Just watch your MLS team FFS. its honestly fun to watch. and go to matches, it's so fun."
"> So Americans were born on the wrong side of the planet and now they can’t be appreciated as normal fans? 

Yes, basically. Unless they, you know, support their local teams.

> The MLS is the laughing stock of this sub, it’s growing bigger these days but it’s been constantly shit on as a “fake league”.

Unfortunately.

> so asking them to just ditch the international team they support and stick to MLS is just unrealistic. 

I never said otherwise. I'm still not taking your opinion on why Barça fans are human garbage seriously if you're a Real fan from California."
Of course all generalisation is bad. But this isn’t based on one conversation. I’ve had many arguments on this site with people who want the Qatar WC moved to America. Same exact arguments are made etc
probably yes but controlling de bruyne's pass from 60 meters with your foot or catching a ball a guy who throws you from 30 meters? first one. also finding a target with your feet is harder so again de bruyne and his teammate that controls the ball are more impressive imo.
"players in baseball develop slower because they mostly need mental skills whereas in football it's the physical that's needed a lot, and physically your prime is mid-late twenties, that's why 24 is a good age to know whether you're done with someone. the only difference really is defenders sometimes peak later and goalkeepers especially do because for them while physicality matters, mental strength and situational intelligence are also very important."
This might shock you but i’m not actually Mustafi so I don’t know why you’re telling me this.
">We concede the 6th least shots on target in the top 5 leagues in Europe

Napoli, Juventus, Bayern, City, PSG, Montpellier, Atletico Madrid all concede less than you. Inter, Barca and Chelsea are all on par with you, Spurs are 2 behind, Atlanta are 4 behind.

Besides, you could easily make the case that because the personnel were so poor, sides didn't need to attack often to score. West Brom are happy to only bother attacking and having a shot on target if it means they score and can defend the goal.

>This is exactly my point. We’ve been better for 3 months now. At one point we were 9 or so points behind United. Now we are 2 points behind. We have been better

So over a few months of the season you've been better but overall, according to the league table, United have been better for the entire season? 

So United have been better this season then?"
You claiming Liverpool have one of the best defensive systems in Europe is genuinely laughable.
So your attack is better than ours but you concede that our defence is superior?
Go check the census results. Most people here don’t go to matches and haven’t been to one in yeeeears. 
"Classic. You're basically the same distance from Porto as you are from Boavista.

Most Americans who support an European club also support a MLS club for your information. I'm an Arsenal supporter in Richmond, Virginia and I'm a member of the Richmond Gooners. And guess what? We also frequently go to Richmond Kickers games and travel two hours north to cheer DC United as well. 

Europeans are just as prone to glory hunting but your anti-Americanism just won't let you see that. There's a great chapter in Soccernomics where the authors show that in almost every single Western European nation, surveys show the most supported club on that nation is COINCIDENTALLY ENOUGH the most currently most successful club.

I’m pretty sure in any given street in Manchester or Newcastle I could find someone who thinks the Empire was the most civilIzing force in history and that Falkland Islands and Gibraltar should remain forever British.

In the top 5 leagues. It’s even bolder so you can see it 
"> I just find it supremely ironic that the most elitist of European fans here always just happen to have the flair of the most successful clubs near them. 

Big surprise, the most sucessful clubs are situated in the biggest cities, which have the most people with access to Reddit, which makes it far more likely for someone like me to be seen than a Boavista fan.

Ever take a geography class? You could definately use it.

> You’re basically equidistant to Boavista and FC Porto. 

Porto is still closer, actually. Stop trying to act like you know anything about the North of Portugal because you took a peek at it in Google Maps. It's pathetic.

> Shit...you’re probably just as close to Salgueiros too. 

Wrong, again. Also, Porto has it's training grounds like 3 minutes away from me, even closer than the Dragão.

> But at some point in your life a CONSCIOUS decision was made to support the second biggest club in the country 

First off, biggest club in the country. Second off, I never made a conscious decision at all. I was born and bred Porto, surrounded by Porto fans my entire life.

No, they aren't.

No, I already explained why this is.

"My connection to them is that I’ve loved them ever since I was born. Am I supposed to just stop loving them? 


I’m genuinely shocked that you can’t see this from my point of view. Imagine that you were in my shoes. If your family had moved to America from Portugal, and your father had instilled a love of Porto into you since the day you were born, you would call yourself a supporter right?"
"Maybe if I lived in an immigrant community with other Porto fans and planned to return to Portugal. Otherwise, there's really no point. Half the fun of being a Porto fan is the rivalry with the other two big teams in the country and Boavista. Without that, I'm left with a team that sells its best players to other teams every season and more often than not gets embarassed in Europe.

I probably just wouldn't care much about soccer, or support my state's team."
That sounds a million times more plastic than anything I’ve ever heard an American fan say. I’m done arguing with you.
Lol sure. Have fun supporting a team you have no real ties to.
You're coming off as a prick who's just salty about that 5-0.
I think this is true and i do like Reus but i wonder what wouldve been without the injuries.
"""Marcus"" Reus, Marco's long lost brother"
A lot of people seem to forget how Messi was actually fairly injury prone until Pep decided to trouble shoot his diet. People also like to forget how Ronaldo basically lives with chronic knee pain (I think its his right knee?). 
Reus could’ve been a Top5 player in world football without the injuries.
I like the ones that didn't get captured (injured)
[Taken from Sammer's interview on Eurosport.de](https://www.eurosport.de/fussball/bundesliga/2017-2018/bundesliga-borussia-dortmund-reus-schurrle-und-gotze-begeistern-sammer_sto6655779/story.shtml)
"For me, the worst case of injuries destroying a career is Giuseppi Rossi."
Sammer in the background wall oddly looks like Reus in 20 years
"I think he can have a career like Robben still. Rarely fit, but less wear and tear due to all the time off. Brilliant performances every time he makes it onto the pitch. "
"It was the same with both Craig Gordon and Darren Fletcher, both out for a really long time but never gave up, and now still play to a high level."
"Easily my favorite player, I'm convinced Reus would have been a top 5 player world wide if he was injured less. I wish I could see Lewandowski, Blaszczykowksi, Piszczek, Reus and Gotze play together again, that was some of the best attacking football I've ever seen. "
"I get that he is trying to talk up a player of a club he played for. As a role model? Did Messi, Ronaldo or Sturridge ever drive without a license for a long time? That is irresponsible behavior. It was not like Reus had a license he forgot to convert, he was born in Germany."
the new hargo
"Reus's injuries are saddening, could have easily been a Ballon d'Or contender without them, really hope he makes the World Cup squad "
Abou Diaby the wisest of all 
"This guy would be the 3rd best in the world right now if it wasn’t for injuries. Could have even been a World Cup winner. He showed us what he can do before his injuries, he was even great in 15/16 when he was going through injuries. Just imagine how great he would have been if he didn’t have any major injuries. It’s sad what has happened to him, but he has looked great since coming back. "
"This title sounds like excellent /r/gatekeeping material. ""Being the best is amazing, but what's really amazing is having career destroying injuries and not giving up."""
;(
"Why should anyone think Messi and Ronaldo are not as motivated and hard working?

"
I would put the real Ronaldo (el gordito) above Reus any day for awful injuries. 
"It's great, but why bring up Messi & Cristiano? Could have said the same thing without adding them to the point. Many other players rarely get injured, you don't see them getting mentioned.

Maybe being compared to those two never helped Reus to begin with. Just like it didn't help Robben, nor Ribéry nor anyone else, really. Whenever papers use the ""the new Messi"" tag, I cringe hard. Now we're starting to see a new trend, ""the new Neymar"", with Vinicius, and he hasn't even come to Europe yet."
Please. He's paid handsomely to do it. Give me 5% of his wage and I'm doing it too.
Not in terms of driving cars 
"I’ve read some Liverpool friends that say the same about Sturridge, but if I’m honest I think that Reus is an even more dramatic case than his or anyone else in this generation."
"If i remember well, the rumours of Barcelona-Madrid looking for him wwre very intense back un the day. 

I thought he was going to be the next Real Madrid Galáctico "
That’s how I am with Pato :(
"Reus would be playing for Barca, Real or a Manchester club by now if it  wasnt for his injuries."
He wouldn't gone to Bayern
He'd be a top 10 offensive player if not top 5
"can say the same thing about hargreaves, wilshere, cazorla etc."
Marko Rashford.
Is Ronaldos knee pain from the Euros or was that just an aggravation of it?
"He also sent out Ronaldinho and Deco who were notorious for lackluster training and poor lifestyle choices like partying. He forced Barcelona to double down on Messi for their future. Worked out pretty good, I'd say. "
What did Pep do with Messi's diet?
I like all US presidents who weren’t fat
"Every time I hear that name, I remember the amount of hate he got for going to play with the Italian national team . Even though he had been with the Italian National team since he was a teenager. That abc piece that was on one of those nightly news shows made him look like a complete asshole by not including his international caps before the 2010 World Cup. "
Really haha you pick him not driving without a license as a reason why he’s not a role model. A Role model doesn’t mean he has to be perfect on all aspects. He is definitely a football role model when it comes to not giving up and to keep on fighting despite Injury after Injury. 
[deleted]
"Um Ronaldo was accused of rape, that's far worse than driving without a license. Even if you don't believe it's likely that he did it (which you should given the stats), that's a whole different level "
That's not really what gatekeeping is. He's not saying Messi and Ronaldo aren't footballers. 
"I think it's a valid point though. Ledley King is another example, had he been injury-free he could've been up there with Englands greatest defenders, maybe he could've moved to a Madrid/Barca and won trophies or stayed with us and helped us win more than the Carling Cup. Instead he dealt with the pain for as long as he could and still managed to put in class performances without even training before it inevitably ruined him. He didn't rack up the football accomplishments that a player of his quality could've but he showed trememdous loyalty and determination to keep playing through the pain for as long as he did. 

That is some real shit, King is incredibly well respected and admired by everyone and now he does great work as an Ambassador for Spurs. He has to live with those injuries still just as Reus will have to when he retires. I'm not saying Reus is more or less amazing that Ronaldo/Messi, just that it is a different kind of challenge and it deserves to be recognised. "
"They surely are very motivated. But what adds to their motivation is the fact that they are constantly notching up high numbers. With Reus it was that he had the potential for something big but injuries kept on nagging him. After a while, you tend to grow frustrated in such cases. But that wasn't the scenario with Reus which is why his determination to constantly make a come back is applauded. "
van basten
"It’s not even comparable. Reus is a next level talent 

BOOM goal "
"Depends how well Reus recovers, because Sturridge was destroyed by injuries. The 13/14 version of him doesn't exist anymore and he's not going to get even close to that level again by the looks of it."
"Fit Sturridge would still never be a World Class player whereas Reus is somebody who has an incredible amount of skill and talent but is tortured by physical limitations. He is an inspirational player for sure. Firstly, with how loyal to BVB he has been and obviously how he's been able to come back time and time again after injuries and play great football."
Yep. Peak Reus was a lot better than peak Sturridge. 
"even if he had a perfectly healthy, superman body, i would want to see him in yellow and black forever."
"Why are people downvoting you? He had his chance to go to Bayern and he chose us instead when he left Mönchengladbach. If he really wanted to go, he would've gone with Lewandowski back in 2014."
Marcus Marin
His knee became a problem around the 2014 WC iirc
He has a rather long history with his knee to be honest. He never let himself fully recover since he was so ambitious to play for the NT etc.
"I dont think it was Pep. He changed his diet after 2014 world cup. He doesnt eat any processed food anymore. Doesn't really eat meat, sugar, and bread, mostly vegetables and fish/seafood. "
"(1) L-Arginine, 1000mg Strength, Taken 1 time daily = 1000mg
(2) Zinc, 50mg Strength, Taken 1 time daily = 50mg
(3) Pygeum, 100mg Strength, Taken 2 times daily = 200mg
(4) Lecithin, 1200mg Strength, Taken 1 time daily = 1200mg
;-)"
More broccoli
Nixon wasn't particularly fat. You sure 'bout dat?
"Yes? It shows that Reus is not considerate or upstanding, he thinks he is above the law.  I would think poorly about anyone who did that and caused a traffic incident or accident. He was an adult and not a teenager yet he acted very immaturely."
Messi and Ronaldo are guilty of using tax schemes but driving without a license is different. It is a brainless crime that says a lot about a person who commits it. You are blatantly putting many lives at risk. 
How is may Mayweather a role model to anyone? Lol.
"So what, I don't give a shit about Ronaldo and he is not a role model. My point is Reus is not a role model. 

Anyway, accused is not the same as charged and convicted.  Reus was convicted, found guilty and fined 500,000 euros. 

Anyone can accuse you of robbery or rape, does not mean anything unless there is enough proof for you to be charged by the prosecutor. God sakes are people here teenagers? "
"Fair point, may have been too harsh on my part."
"King was boss. It was crazy how he wouldn't practice or lift, just rehab during the week, and then just be thrown in the fire and just take control of big games."
"Yup, put him up as well "
"honestly sometimes i get downvoted and questioned about it, cause it is admittedly extreme, but to this day, when i watched prime Reus in 2012 or whenever it was that he really burst onto the international scene, he was one of the best players i had ever seen. honestly he was. insane pace, passing, finishing, movement, dribbling, he was just incredible. i didnt watch him extensively but the games i saw he was something else, and if those performances defined him he would be top 20 players i have personally watched, definitely. "
"He is but if Sturridge isn’t in that class for his respective position, he’s damn close. 

Especially considering the constant stop and starts to his career, I’d put him up there with some of the most clinical finishers in the game alongside Lewa, Kane, and Icardi.

But Reus’ story is one of the most tragic I’ve seen in football. Up there with the likes of Ronaldo, even Diaby."
"Reus always come back looking great, it's insane.
"
"That's bullshit. Sturridge was world class for a season. And still showed glimpses of it after his first injuries. But didn't get close to those

No doubt in my mind as to who is the better player. But people in this thread are really downplaying the talent of Daniel Sturridge."
"> Fit Sturridge would still never be a World Class player

Bollocks. Sturridge at his best was electric. Him at his peak in this liverpool team would be insane."
"As a Dortmund fan I wonder if his injuries and the timing of those injuries are the reason I'm still able to see him play and score for us instead of Barca or Real. It certainly should have played a role, but maybe he would have said no to other teams anyway, who knows."
"That's bullshit. Sturridge was world class for a season. And still showed glimpses of it after his first injuries. But didn't get close to those

Sadly in reality Superman will always wear blue and red/carmine.
"Not sure if intended, but Marcus Marin was a fairly decent striker in the Bundesliga (33 goals) and 2. Bundesliga (75 goals).

"i heard it was both knees, and that he would literally never ever admit to the docs the level of pain he'd be playing through"
Yeah pretty much this. Pep is doing the same thing at City - its actually really interesting to see how much emphasis he puts on his players diet and overall health
"doesnt sound that bad, and the things someone mentioned above are really popular and quintessential, i dont know what the fuss is about, im sure people are taking good care of him"
"Pep got a team of personal trainers and cooks to micromanage his physical health. Messi still cheated his diet, but most of his routines were carefully monitored, and any bad influences (Deco, Ronaldinho) were pushed out of the club. After Pep, Messi's injury struggles disappeared."
You forgot the key ingredient. Each serving has a splash of love 
I remember hearing something about more seafood
"He was also a pretty good president, if you remove the criminal stuff of course. "
"Above the law you say? So CR7 and Messi thought they were above the law with tax evasion yet they are still considered role models.. Driving without a license is such a minor offense in comparison to all the other things he could do to be considered ""above the law"" lol."
"Fair point, but i still dont think him not having a license puts more lives at risk assuming he knows the rules of the road, Or that he isnt a Role Model to Soccer players."

How is he putting more lives at risk without a license assuming he knows how to drive as opposed to people with a license..?

"You're the one who brought up Ronaldo though in comparison to Reus in your original comment about  ""irresponsible behavior"".

At least in the US (which is where the alleged assault happen) 95% of sexual assaults are actual sexual assaults, not false accusations. [It’s higher in the UK too](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/heres-the-truth-about-false-accusations-of-sexual-violence-88049). And I'm not a court or a prosecutor so I'm not going to judge Ronaldo as if I'm one, that's asinine logic. I'm not the one deciding to send him to jail, but I can make a claim on whether his behavior is worthy of being a role model.

If you're seriously trying to argue on the basis that Reus being convicted of a much lesser crime than Ronaldo who was just accused (and by the way dude, he settled the case...) of a much, much worse crime, well that's just an objectively bad argument."
"Yeah, still a weird comparison to make, definitely. "
"I completely agree with you. 2012-2014 Reus was a top 5 player in the world, and I genuinely believe he's the greatest ever German talent (which is saying a fucking lot) that never was. I hope he can salvage the next 3-4 years he has left of his prime and be a good 10 goal and 10 assist guy a season. It's just sad because he should be scoring 25+ and 10+ assists on a consistent seasonal basis. "
"Watch the games vs real in the semis or in the groups. The guy is fucking insane, without a doubt he would be a star at barca or real if not for all his injuries and i guess he would be top3 ballon dor consistently (obv always losing to messi and cr7) but in form/injury free reus is an upgrade for every team on this planet"
"Yea reus was a top 5 player for a couple of years, he was and still is INSANELY talented."
"Ahh Diaby.  Tall, powerful, athletic.  Gave plenty of highlight moments, and fought back from injury again and again with a smile on his face.  I wish we could have seen his potential develop."
"Yeah he just gets these unlucky injuries sometimes too. He's never had a severe injury, and he has loads of confidence. I know Robben had iniury issues for a while, but they went away for the most part. I think Reus could do the same with a little luck."
Yeah Sturridge you can really see the talent he has. I think if he wasn’t injured and didn’t bounce around so much he’d be at a bigger club right now 
"His finishing, always, is world class. When his body didn’t resemble a husk, he, as a footballer, was world class."
"I think the key difference here is that despite each setback Reus returned and repeatedly delivered good performances. Studge didn't.

I remember the time Reus Hazard Gotze Eriksen and Neymar were expected to be that next generation of insane attacking midfielders/wingers, back in 2011-2013. Funny how that turned out"
"Yep. He had the pace, the ability to create scoring chances on his own and a great finishing ability. Was not a shabby passer either. He was an absolute joy to watch. Unfortunately it only lasted about 1.5 seasons. :("
[oooooooh don't be so sure!](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111190895/4101475-injustice-+gods+among+us+-+year+two+%282014-%29+022-021.jpg)
I hope he doesn't end up like Batistuta.
Rio said it in one of his interviews on BT said Ronaldo isnt past it but he's got knee issues
pep is the wenger 20 something years ago
"Yeah its pretty amazing how much effort he puts into making his players perform at the highest levels, its the small things that adds up. He also brought a special nutritionist to help his players transition into the new diet system. "
"Well, you'd have to use very dated standards if you want to consider him a ""good"" president. Lest we forget he was racist and antisemitic as all get out."
">	So CR7 and Messi thought they were above the law with tax evasion yet they are still considered role models.

Not to take away from your point but tax avoidance and evasion are in every rich person’s playbook. I bet they are all guilty of committing one or the other(maybe both at the same time for maximum gains). 

Driving without a license is not a minor offense in the scope of it’s costs to society. You could cause a car crash that ends up taking the lives of others. "
"> but i still dont think him not having a license puts more lives at risk assuming he knows the rules of the road

Wtf?! Him not having a license is a pretty good indicator of him not knowing the rules of the road. It’s probably a miracle that he didn’t cause an accident like Marcos Alonso or Kluivert."
"It is not like Reus could not afford driving lessons in his free time. He is a millionaire footballer who thought driving licenses are for peasants, he is special and above the law. How is that a role model?"
">How is he putting more lives at risk without a license assuming he knows how to drive as opposed to people with a license..?

Why on earth do you assume Reus can drive better unqualified compared to people with driving licenses?! Do you also assume Reus can do heart surgery better than qualified doctors?"
"I’ve seen a lot of stuff from him, but he seem like a despicable person from every aspect to me.

"
"Cristiano is an absolute saint off the pitch.  Never has put a foot wrong, mayweather is beat his wife in front of their kids and spends his nights in his strip clubs."
Deisler though
That 2013 Reus was better than Hazard and on Ribery-like levels. Such a shame. Still my favorite player. 
Goetze before his drop in form from his metabolic illness should be on that same level I think. He and Reus were absolutely phenomenal in that side. They beat Bayern to the title twice and got to the CL finals.
I mean... isn't everyone in that list (apart from Götze) considered world class?
Well played.
Yeah exactly. One of the new chefs is somewhat famous on Instagram and you can see the stuff she makes for the team. Pretty cool
He also handled China quite well
When you think millions of dollars of tax evasion has no effect on society but driving (you said no reason why the license would be relevant) doesn’t. Lol. 
"You make good points. Yeah I mean when I saw Messi was caught it was kind of like a ""oh no surprise what rich person in Spain wouldn't be doing this"". When Reus got caught without a license I thought he was irresponsible and actually quite dumb and obviously its a danger to society. I think lesser of Reus maybe because how can you be that stupid to not just get a license you know. I'm sure he wasn't some crazy driver out there but still. Oh and he paid a hefty ass fine for it. "
"It's much better to have common sense and not know the rules than vice versa. If you use your brain and your eyes, you don't need to know every little german traffic rule."
"Having a License doesnt mean you’re a better driver then someone without one, it just means you’re legally allowed to drive. People with licenses get in accidents all the time having one doesnt make you immune to accidents or a superior driver. Not having a License also doesnt mean you dont know the rules of the road just like having a License also does not guarantee that you know them.  Idk about Kluivert but Alonso had a License when he got into his accident."
"I don't know Reus's case, i would like to know if he had passed his driving lessons, however Reus doing this is immature as it's simple to get a driving license"
 Not having a license doesnt mean you cant drive. Thats like saying just because you have a gun permit its means you’re a sharpshooter. Not having a license doesnt affect your driving.
having a drivers license means jackshit
"Reus just kinda was/is my favorite player in the world. I got to see all of Reus career and saw when he was at the top of his game. I never really watched Deisler except for some youtube videos, so my views are admittedly subjective. For me Reus was just world class in every aspect of his attacking play at the age of 24. There's still some random points where I'll think about him getting hurt and not playing in that German team at the 2014 WC and it legitimately bums me out for like a solid 2 minutes lol. "
Reus wasnt with Dortmund yet in the title winning seasons.
Ugh them playing behind Lewandowski was one of my favorite teams to watch ever 
"Why not Gotze if any of them?

Technically, hazard has never had a big performance in Europe (albeit two seasons without UCL during his time at Chelsea)
Eriksen has been insane this season but this is just the first time.
Reus and Gotze both rekt by injury imo

Neymar is the only one to win the UCL, and hazard has played just one semi final and I think Reus and Gotze just that one final run which they lost. Eriksen is playing his first KO round in the UCL

I know it's not the only criterion but I mean shit like that is where you differentiate your 'really good players' and the 'cream of the crop outliers' kind of guys.

I love Eden I really do but even him, as arguably the second best of the lot hasn't even played at a level of a guy like Lampard or Ballack(I mean in terms of just level of play, I know, different positions) in the UCL. He's been a god in the EPL but in all honesty a lot of players have started after him and seem to be going ahead of him. 

And I'm really trying not to be overcritical here. Cause spurs have bloomed late, and Eriksen has been insane this year. The German lads HAVE had poor injury luck. Hazard hasn't played at a Barcelona, agreed, but Chelsea aren't numpties either, y'know

"
Yeahhh i saw their IG. I can definitely change my diet if somebody cooked like that for me haha
"I agree. By the way I’m not implying that tax avoidance and evasion are tolerable offenses in any means because they are excepted of rich people. I’m just saying, imagine being in a position where you could save millions of your hard earned money by playing a little bit dirty...~~it’s tempting,no?~~it would be stupid of you not to do it. "
Driving without a license is also a pretty good indicator of not having common sense.
"> Having a License doesnt mean you’re a better driver then someone without one

Not necesarilly but it’s a pretty safe bet to take. People need to take driving lessons and get their license for a reason. These are institutions that are designed to make people safer drivers. "
If he didn't pass his driving test he should know not to drive. It is not astrophysics. He can afford a chauffeur.
"> Not having a license doesnt mean you cant drive.

It also does not mean that you *can drive*. It might, however, be indicative of immaturity /considering yourself above the law or a host of other things. 

I like the guy, no doubt but why are you trying to defend something which clearly falls in the category of ""breaking the rules"". I am sure, Reus himself would agree this should never have happened"
"Not having a license means he has not passed stringent tests to drive and is not allowed to drive by law, for the sake of everyone else's safety. I can use a scalpel or operate a forklift without any prior experience but I am not a licensed surgeon or forklift operator so I might cause a serious workplace mishap. Is it so hard to understand that you should not drive without a license? Would you like to be operated on by unlicensed surgeons?

Either you are a special brand of stupid or you have a deep disregard for laws and the safety of others. I don't know which is worse."
deisler was basically reus before reus just with like every bad footballer injury there is besides a broken leg.. poor dude would be a legend by now
"Reus, Arango and Herrmann for us was also absolutely beautiful. "
"that is nice to hear, it’s happening the same to me watching Salah, Bobby and Mané Mané :)"
"Fair, but that doesn't really make Götze better, does it? After all, he was a flop at Bayern and has been underwhelming for Dortmund ever since his return, not to mention that he probably won't get near Germany's starting XI in the summer.

I agree with most of your points by the way, I just think you're letting off Götze too easily. "
What’s their name on IG?
Good revision lol. I'd do it in a heartbeat and wouldn't think twice about it so hard to blame them. I just wanted to point out in my comment that if we are degrading role models for breaking the law albeit harmful then we need to look at the top. 
Obviously but thats not my point.
"You’re right im simply trying to state that just because he doesn’t have a license, it does not make him more of a risk to peoples lives. Also in most cases driving without a license makes the driver more cautious since he/she wouldnt want to get pulled over."
"You're comparing apples to oranges.  Unless you're elderly or have terrible hand eye coordination or anxiety, driving is pretty easy once you've practiced a bit.  Yeah it's pretty dumb he didn't get his license, but I'm sure he's a fine driver, I'd rather be a passenger in his car than my grandma's, and she has a license"
I watched both. Reus is a level above Deisler. That's nothing against Deisler but more about how good Reus is. Deisler never scored much and Reus is just the complete package.
@Stremoleda
"He got caught speeding and that was when the traffic warden found out he had no license. The main difference between Reus and [unlicensed teenagers who cause needless death](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/leeds-crash-all-five-victims-named-after-stolen-car-smashes-into-tree-a3702201.html) is luck.



I'm sure you rather be a passenger in Marcos Alonso's car than your grandma's too. Because he is a famous footballer and that is what matters to you."
true. but deisler was more of a Classic winger while reus is more of a forward 
"I can’t understand why people are downvoting you. Reus is probably driving a supercar, those things can be incredibly dangerous especially in the hands of someone without a license."
Outside Mid*
Because people ITT are Americans who have only driven automatic cars on gigantic freeways. It's incredibly irresponsible to drive without a license.
I started going to Leyton Orient on a £5 season ticket in the late 90s and I've been going back ever since. The cruel bastards. They're just like advertisements aimed at kids for cigarettes. 
"Amazing way to help kids get to see the football too, as well as keep the older ""kids"" coming. Turning 16/17 and having the season ticket go up to adult price or near it is insanity and prices most people out of the games unless they're working full time or still having their parents pay (which is quite a large financial burden on parents). That £100 for the 18 - 23 bracket is amazing, when most clubs are probably charging adult prices in the mid hundreds, even in the Champ."
"Buzzing for this, as a student I can barely afford to go to games but now I know where my next loan is going "
"I was born in Nottingham and every year from 5-12 they'd send me a free ticket to a home game for my birthday, they're a great team that look out for their young fans "
"Love this, much better than Fawaz charging thirty quid each week to watch us stay up by two goals. Such a better feel around the place now. "
Can you not get in if you're 24+?
"Brilliant from Forest, more clubs need to offer cheaper tickets like we do as well. "
Another good step from our new owners. We have done half-season tickets before though.
"Kind of regret not going to Nottingham university, now. "
"i wonder what happens to this offer if they ever get back in the PL.

"
"I really, really wish we'd do something similar. We're absolutely hemorrhaging fans due to high prices and dire football. Soon we won't be able to get them back. "
"The new ownership are really showing some good leadership with this. It feels good that my club is setting a good example off the field for once.

(For anyone not familiar with Forest's recent history, our previous owner was a complete charlatan who got us an 18-month transfer embargo and kept firing managers, resulting in a period of decline over 5 years which very nearly saw us relegated to league 1 and attendances plummeted. They're coming back up now.)"
"IMO more of the 'smaller' clubs should do this in order to get more youth amongst their fanbases, the few games I go to I notice a lot more older faces as time has gone on. Seems like these days with infinite media coverage kids are even more likely to be fans of the big teams or the superstar players instead of their local team."
Excellent work forest. I saw some research or suchlike a few years ago and something like two thirds fans will support the team they first go to see at a match. I know that happened with me and my mates who never went to games were all glory Hunters. (mind you back then forest were in top 5 and went to Wembley 6 times in 4 years) 
As a season ticket holder who is turning 24 in May - for fuck’s sake!
"I remember how we, as kids, showed up at the Olympiastadion an hour before the game and always got tickets for Bayern for 2.5 Deutsche Mark in the early nineties."
"Big clubs could easily do this as well, ticket income is almost nothing compared to the TV money these days."
Beautiful news
So proud of my club <3
£100 for a season ticket for a 21 year old lad? That will help out students and apprentices massively.
Bet the atmosphere there will be amazing
Oh damn. I lived in Nottingham until last year and would have been all over this deal. It was £28 quid per ticket for a game for students last year iirc. Good on them still 
Then theres our owners who put the prices up after relegation last summer
"I'm just about old enough to remember visits from the likes of Bayern, Liverpool and Manchester United. Younger fans have become accustomed to mediocrity on the pitch and bad management off it. This is an excellent and essential move from us."
Might get one Nottingham isn’t far and that’s cheap as chips! Don’t care that I don’t support them really for that price I’ll happily go to most home games why not 
Great! Now I can watch my team get beat for even cheaper!
Barry Bennell now supports Nottingham Forrest
Good stuff. Would like to hear more of this. Season tickets can be extortionate sometimes
And my season ticket is going up £50 (again) next season.
Offering tickets at cheaper prices for concessions? It'll never catch on.
They did this back when I was a teenager as well. Me and my mates got season tickets for £50 each.. but I guess this is even cheaper due to inflation.
My season ticket nearly doubles from £250 to £500ish at West Ham next season as I turn 22. No clue how I’m going to afford it. Really nice to see some clubs have sensible pricing platforms still.  
"I've been a fan for years, My wife has a season ticket but I don't. If she can't go, I go. This is great news to get younger fans involved!!"
"At first, I thought it was 10 for each ticket and I was thinking ok... its a decent deal, but not that impressive. 

Then when I got to the 50/100, I realized that its season tickets. That is such a great deal. Good on them. I hope other clubs do the same. I was so poor when I was a student. "
I am 12
I was heartily impressed when they were televised against Arsenal.  I consider myself a fan of the team - I live in Massachusetts USA.
£100 for a season ticket is amazing. You pay that much for one ticket in some of the worst seats in Anfield
"This is awesome! I used to get my hands on free Forest tickets all the time when I was younger, it was always a great experience even though I was already a diehard Arsenal fan at that point, good to hear for young people of the future!"
"Miserable old prick perspective: my club did something similar a few years back. I was surrounded by kids who spent the whole time jumping up and down on their seats, not giving half a shit about the game and asking when they could go home. I found this intensely annoying.

If you offer 10 quid session tickets people are going to use it as day care."
"This is how you build the next generation of fans, what a great idea (if a team can afford it). "
My city is in /r/all 0.o
If only all clubs in the PL would be this sensible. 
"Meanwhile,  I paid £69 to see England v San Marino"
it should stack with income and not age. 
"Good to see them paying people more the older they get. I guess those that are 18\-23 are probably more likely to remember watching Forest play than young kids

Jokes aside that's pretty good. Football tickets shouldn't be unobtainable, it defeats the joy of the game for so many"
I always like when a title says something and then tells me how I should feel about it. Takes all of the effort out of forming my own opinion. 
"For those who haven't followed Evangelos Marinakis over the years, don't be fooled by acts like this one. 

As a fellow Olympiacos fan I can ensure you that the overwhelming majority of us believe he is the reason for the massive decline of the club in the recent years, and one of the major facts of the decline of the Greek football in general.

Let's not mention the huge scandals he's been involved into, plus the fact that he uses the club in order to get political influence over the country."
£100 for 18-23 makes me want to buy season tickets from America 
Benfica needs to see this
How much does Dad (or Mum) have to pay?
"100 quid is great value over the course of a year, especially consideringI pay almost four times that for my internet alone."
All football league clubs should take note.
well that's one way to ensure a hype atmosphere
"I used to go and watch Tranmere Rovers all the time. They were nearly promoted to the Premiership a few times but then had a few tough years and are now a non league side.

Considering they are competing for support with Liverpool and Everton, an adult season ticket is £340. For a non league team. WTF "
you'll never win anything with kids .... in the stands
"Trent student here, great offer from the club but given my flair I think it's safe to say I won't be taking them up on that offer. XD"
"Absolutely smashing form, NotFor! Downright humming for this one, mates. 

What a brilliant move. Brilliant!"
"This is really cool, Because fuck a $100 wouldn't even get you a seat for my sports team."
"Liverpool should adopt something similar. Here in the States theirs a good amount of young fans of Liverpool, but from my understanding it’s not the same in England? "
I'm not a football fan and only saw this because it's so fucking awesome. Most sports/entertainment should be the same way
Little beats me paying £20 for the 23 home matches a season for Northern Premier side Marine as a 16 year old.
I know season tickets at Wednesday are cheap if you’re a kid but they do need to help out “young adults” more. Whenever I go the stands are full (or not) of middle aged guys and the odd family.
"I think this is a good move, the problem before with lower league footy was that the clubs would have special 'kid a quid' games or offer cheap tickets to whole schools for for single matches, and that suddenly around aged 14 these offers stop and it's full price (or close to). This ends up destroying the atmosphere for those who have paid full price, as you'd get 1000 8 year olds at these games. most of whom are ignoring the game and running between snack bar/toilet and their friends, and doesn't lead to long term support as these kids are going once or twice a season and few get into it properly, then the ones who do get hammered for full price a few years later.

With a scheme like this the kids who are going to take it up are going to be going in much smaller groups, the young ones with parents, the 12-17 year olds can easily go in groups with their mates (and many parents will see £50 to get the teenage kid out of their hair one saturday a fortnight as a very wise investment), they are actually going to have an interest in the game rather than just the novelty of being in a stadium as they are going repeatedly."
"this is good, the prices are way beyond what people earn and the issue is some teams play a style of football that I can't stand watching on MOTD let alone if I paid £20 or even £200-£300 a year for. "
Take note fc dallas! Not paying 600ish for two seats as an 18 yr old fan!
"Never understood why clubs don't understand their goal should be to fill their stands with young fans every game.  Create that next generation of fans while getting a better atmosphere at the game.  Win-Win.

If I owned a club, I would give out basically free tickets to children (with the purchase of a regular price seat).  They will spend more in concessions and souvenirs than the ticket cost and they will likely come back to another game later."
Great way to secure the future of the game too.
"Ok, now all i have to do is travel half way across the world to see them!... Oh shit."
They often do £1 for a child at home games. 
How is it more expensive to watch Kings Lynn FC  than Nottingham Forrest for a season?!?
"I like the idea of this to make it way more affordable, however it seems so cheap that it would make it too easy to miss games. If my season ticket costs a ton then I'm not going to mind missing half the games. If it costs a few hundred I'm more likely to not miss some so I'm getting value for money"
"Meanwhile, our absolute utter thundercunts of owners think concessions are bad and got rid of them."
So how expensive are season tickets for 17 and 18 year olds?
It shows how far club finances have shifted away from ticket sales.  They are just trying to break even on match day with those prices. 
"I'm 20, English and never seen a football match. Am I normal?"
"As an American, I'm insanely jealous of this. 1. I don't have any pro teams close enough to me to justify a season ticket, and 2. There's no way I could afford it."
"Why couldn't they do this last year, would have easily spent £100 to spend my weekends watching footie at uni :("
Even down in League 1 these will be relatively cheap prices. Good on Forest!
My season ticket is only 230 pounds new. But it does mean watching Birmingham play every other week or so. I want a refund.
As a german. That last sentence came out of nowhere. Those prices are not low for a second tier team 
Cardiff have very reasonably priced season tickets this year and next year (even if we go up) at £99 for students and £59 for kids and OAPs.
Who needs money when you've got Colback on loan.
At any age! For 92$ watch usmnt friendly before other nations compete this summers WC
How can they make money by doing this? I don't understand.
Just a shame you have to watch Forest.
Well they need to get the crowds in somehow....
Shame they got no fans.
[deleted]
still cunts
"Nottingham Forest confirm: ""fanbase made up of people who attended the 1980 European Cup Final"""
Shame they don't have a reduced price for older 'students' too. By which I mean people with NUS cards who aren't technically students. 
Okay? I was paying about £100  for a season ticket here when we were in La Liga playing against Real Madrid and Barcelona not against Cardiff and Wolves lol
[deleted]
When I went a few years ago I paid something like £23 for a ticket. Way too much for league one football.
"“It’s never too late to quit.”

"
"Yeah, I got hooked in a bit later with a £20 ticket for the west stand. Next to a chain smoker."
It's like a drug dealer who gives away the first hit free. Disgraceful.
Few years ago (think they still do it) Leyton Orient were doing free season tickets to under 18s that lived in the area. I'm not even that into football but I went to loads of games cos it was a fun day out!
I seem to recall the price was the main factor preventing 16-year-olds and up from attending games in the BBC's price of football survey.
"I mean, I pay £50 just for an Arsenal membership to be able to even buy tickets.
  
And this lot can get a whole season worth's of matches for double the price.
  
Good on Forest, really makes me think about how I actually spend my money at this sinking ship of a club."
"For Derby next season (we might be going up, but still)

https://www.dcfc.co.uk/media/get/ST%20Price%20Table%2018.19%20LOW%20RES-01.jpg

Derby doesn't struggle for attendance (about 21k season ticket holders, about 25k average attendance I think) so I guess they can get away with it."
"Yeah you’re right, U21 Season Ticket for me in the Holte is £160 I think it was "
Mechelen does this too for students and it's the only reason some of my friends own a season ticket.
Got my reading season ticket (18-24) for £99 absolutely love it. 
"Yup. That young adult bracket is critical as their disposable income is non-existent. Benfica does 2€/3€ tickets (the price is the injury time in the previous match) for under 25s.

It's a very limited quantity (around 2500 tickets I'd guess) and in the worst seats possible but it sure brought me to the stadium more often."
23 in the mls and ticket is $430 (~£308)for supporters section. 
"> when most clubs are probably charging adult prices in the mid hundreds

Mid hundreds is all? Jeez, NFL season tickets start in the thousands and go up to the hundreds of thousands

"I seriously don't understand why everywhere offers ""seniors"" discounts. Like, are you fucking kidding me?? The over 65 crowd are the rich bastards with all the money! Where're the under 30 discounts, we're the ones who need discounts!"
You a UoN man or a Trent man?
How did they know when your birthday was?
"Used to do ""Kids for a Quid"" which I thought was great too"
"Going from Fawaz to evangelos is like night and day, mans actually got an idea how to reinvigorate a club and win over the fans via ways other than kind words"
"As someone who also follows Forest quite closely, I couldn't agree more. 

Fawaz was suffocating Forest with mismanagement, but from what I can see the club is finally being run properly. Hopefully next step is giving the old CG the once over!"
Even though the football has been poor at time this season it’s nice to have owners who actually seem to know how to run a club.
In Nottingham that’s the life expectancy.
It's from £330 full price
How can you go if your in jail?
By that time you're expected to have a child in the under 11 category to buy tickets for you.
It's great because literally all our friend group have season tickets and we get to watch the odd game or two while hanging out great way to spend the day and it's dirt cheap too.
"If it helps, your new owner is a mafia thug who will use the team as a profit resource and drain it as much as he can, like he did all those years with Olympiakos. Expect every player with potential to be sold immediately to the highest bidder.

Uni of Notts and Nottingham in general is a blast. Miss it so much. 
Where'd you go instead if you don't mind me asking?
"I never though i'd see a Leamington fan on here . Being from Leamington, I should probably get down to the Windmill some time"
The same kids can then get a cheap pensioner ticket. 
That's academic.
I don't think Forest need to worry about that
"Didn't change our prices when it happened, admittedly ours weren't quite as cheap but not far off relatively speaking. Even if Forest doubled those prices for the Prem it would still be ridiculously cheap.

It's the best way to get proper support that don't just sing when your winning. Look at our fans this season, it means so much and can get you points."
Don't worry that won't happen. 
Our owners promised that if we ever get to the prem tickets will be a quid lol
We'll all be using Cryptocurrencies by then
Off topic but how far off is Dozzell from being fully fit?
"We'll take Flynn Downes off your hands in the summer if you like? 

Hes absolutely rubbish, you dont want him. Honest.... "
Definitely should. I once paid £20 a ticket for a Tranmere game away at Swindon a few years ago. Felt like I had been robbed. Haven't been to another Tranmere game since cos it's not worth it
"It's really important to get the youth in, the average age of a football fan is going up and up (that's fans attending games). The smaller clubs (including clubs like villa) need to get the young supporters in the door so they have future generation of fans. "
"Yep, the hype around the few big city Premier League teams has caused lots of problems for the smaller clubs. Even worse off seem to be the teams in the middle, who have managed to get into the PL, seen massive rise in attendances and then an even faster drop when they relegate."
Aren't the 'smaller' clubs more dependent on season ticket income to fund running costs? So their concern is more on short-term revenue than long-term sustainability.
"It's worse than that. Less kids are getting into football at all than ever before. Prices + Internet bringing in a myriad of new interests.

I've seen a few people starting this discussion here in Portugal, off all places. I think it's an important one to have."
"Easy to say that but ticket revenue is such a huge part of a clubs finances, and gets increasingly more important the lower down the leagues you go where there is little to no TV money going around and the sponsorship money is just from the local car dealership than a big multi national.  

Its a big risk for clubs who are so reliant on ticket money and gate receipts, especially season ticket money which tends to come in over the summer when clubs are struggling for cash. 

Its why youll see clubs dip their toe in the water with kids for a quid offers for the odd game but to do that for a full season is really difficult for a lot of clubs. "

"As a 32 year old turning 33 in October, paying full price since 16? (I’m not sure when adult prices started) For fucks sake...

But if it stops some local kids becoming plastic fans then I’m all for it. Great news. "
"Big clubs already have tens of thousands of people on a waiting list for a season ticket, I know an old boy at my work has been waiting quite a few years and he's still around 8000th in the queue. EDIT: For a Spurs season ticket*


This is a great tactic for a team like ours though to fill up the stadium and win over some of the newer generation who might get their heads turned supporting a team in a bigger league rather than a local one"
"You should experience them singing ""Mull Of Kintyre"" before KO at least once in your life. It's something to behold."
"Do it! Join us in Bridgford lower, Y1 👍"
"Too soon, man."
How much is a season ticket up at Celtic these days?
"What's this ""concessions"" malarkey? Don't they know business guru Ehab Allam thinks children should pay the same price as their father?"
Offer them 2.50 next season to mirror their transfer policy 
Do the club know your DOB? I got U21tickets until I was 24
More like 1200 
Welcome aboard! 
"That's a ridiculous exaggeration. I wish our tickets were cheaper, but I pay £40 a ticket and I've been every home game this season. Cheapest shit seats are £9 (only 500 though) and most expensive non hospitality seats are about £60-65 and are the best view in the ground."
"seeing as how they have to be accompanied by an adult (which will cost them at least 330), im not sure thats entirely the case"
"Exactly. As a club I’d like to see us continue, and you can’t do that in the lower leagues without matchgoing fans.

Investing in your support is as important as investing in your players to teams without the silly income of the prem tv and sponsorship deals. Especially a club like Forest where the remnants of the “glory years” fan base are tailing off, we’ve had little to cheer about for a long time and we’re now years out of the top tier. 

Should turn out to be a wise move when all those kids get jobs and buy tickets and merch at full price and keep showing up when the 70’s-90’s fans start to dry up."
Why?
"I've no doubt he's somewhat of a villain, but doubt this decision came from him and more likely the chairman, Nicolas Randall QC."
£330 is the cheapest adult ST
There's definitely lots of fans. Just whether they can afford to go the games is another question.
Much easier for Liverpool to justify their prices though because of the demand
"Forest still do kids for a quid I believe. To be honest I quite enjoy those games, it makes for a nicer atmosphere than the usual abuse our fans tend to throw"
"i imagine its about bringing them in whilst they are young and getting them interested, we dont sell out our stadium (apart from when Derby come) so there needs to be creative pricing to hit that sweet spot between making money and filling/increasing the fans in the stadium"
"They don't?

Football is a loyalty business. I'm a Leeds fan because I'm from Leeds and my Dad was a Leeds fan. When I was a kid my uncle took me to games. I kept going when we were in league one. I'll never support anyone else.

They get kids and young people used to going to footie for a few hundred quid then when they're adults they'll fork out for full-price for the rest of their lives. Like a crack dealer giving you the first hit as a freebie."
"Stewards probably make minimum wage so doesn't cost much to get more of them. Policing costs might go up but then hopefully beer and pie sales.

The plan is, get 'em hooked young and then you've potentially got a good revenue stream for decades."
"I'm sure they can make up the difference for what they charge for food and drinks in the stadium. However, what's important is that kids are getting the opportunity to become loyal to the club, which in the long term is more important. Loyalty pays"
It is investing in the future for their club and  also investing and giving children to ability to get to enjoy the game. Many can become lifelong fans and will remember going to those games. It is a great incentive for the club and community 
CLASSIC BANTER
"Wait, really? Supply and demand I suppose...in Cinci and Denver, you can get cheap tickets for under $10. "
"Derby's still an awful place to live, visit, drive through, etc. 

:("
How much do you pay this season to watch you not play against Real Madrid and Barcelona? 
Cool.
"is that it? I was paying about £99 when Derby were facing the likes of Barca, Real Madrid, Bayern, Pompey and even got to see prime Pele"
Congratulations. We’re all very impressed with you.
The difference being that Brits don't need help filling up their stadiums
season tickets are for the entire home season.. sooooo it's pretty self explanatory 
You're in for a treat next year then mate
"Yeah, I can just about remember what League 1 football was like"
My local club charges £10 for 8th tier football
"Not in a million years would I pay 30€ for a league one match that isn't a derby, or some other special atmosphere game. How the fuck can hey charge that much?"
"Yeah definitely. It was a long time ago for me, but when I turned 16 and the ticket went up, even at the same time we got relegated from the PL. Asking my Dad to pay £500 or something over the £250 it was at the time (guess amounts, can't really remember), was excessive, and it just wasn't something I could afford myself."
"Wait, you have to pay for the ability to buy tickets? WTF 0_o "
"Christ that's very expensive for a Championship side, regardless of whether it's looking like you can go up.

My friend supports Reading and his ST was less than £200"
"They really should put a dot at the end of ""Cat"""
"> £160

Jesus, Cork City in the League of Ireland charge €235 (£205). I know bigger numbers will bring the tickets down but the football is incomparable. You at least get to watch players like Hourihane. What do we get? Jimmy Keohane? Fuck me..."
"And those prices are a lot better than the clubs around us as well. I am glad our club knows football is more than money, and you need to have a great atmosphere to do well. "
truly the sport of the people
"I know you're probably being sarcastic but old people usually live off pensions and football is a fairly working class sport.
"
"Trent, from Nottingham as well, so I have the misfortune of supporting forest from birth "
Plot twist: Ticket was from his Dad who just wanted to make sure he stayed a Forest fan.
He didn't he signed up 365 times and let the free tickets roll in.
"Good luck with having Clough back, by the way. Always rated him but things haven’t worked out for him here."
Especially around the Stapleford area. 
"Oi, not having that from a Scouser! (Assuming you're from Liverpool)"
There's a reason it's called Shottingham
It's nicknamed shottingham for a reason.
"u need to change your handle and your flair mate. Oh, and try not to breath in the fumes, inhaling melting plastic is toxic"
Still miles better than our last one thanks!
"Noo don't say that, I only have a year left! "
"There aren't many, if any, better places to be a student in. "
Even Notts Trent isn't a bad Uni nowadays 
Kent. 
"Universty it Sheffield. I thought I’d get worse results than what i did i expected and though adjustment Manchester/UCL/Bristol, Exter and kings made m wit a few days. Sheffield said yes withhin the next 10 minutes. Big big regeret because of the grades I got I got in couldn have gone to uni in the country b"
"I’m Forest and that still made me laugh, then weep a little."
Can't remember exactly but it was pretty much the whole season. Maybe with a game or two at the end if he recovers well.
"Having said that, for that game Swindon would have set the price rather than Tranmere. It's possible home Tranmere (and other away) games would be cheaper.

Edit: And considering Tranmere are in the National League now, I imagine all the games would be a little cheaper."
"You was.

It was free entry that night."
I watched AFC Telford against Alfreton Town on boxing day 2016 and it cost me £16. Being in Telford it definitely felt like I'd been robbed
"Yeh had discussed it on here a few weeks back that it is particularly evident in the North West, you have teams like Preston, Bolton, Wigan, Blackburn, Huddersfield, they all have half-filled stadiums and struggle with attendance. That definitely has something to do with the area having Man United, Man City and Liverpool all on their doorsteps. Why would anyone want to watch something like Preston v. Reading in the Championship when you can go down the road and watch Champions League fixtures in spectacular stadiums, especially for youngsters these days who will get to see the superstars they follow on Instagram and Twitter.

Exactly the same thing with London clubs like Palace, QPR, Charlton, Millwall, Fulham"
Yep great news! It’s all about building life long fans (and customers) who will invest in the club for many more years to come. 
It really is good. I've already sent this to a few friends as its affordable even for students. 
12 years I was on the Arsenal waiting list
"Doesn't mean you should price people out of them though. Look at Germany with fair prices for their fans, even Bayern, whereas season tickets at clubs like Arsenal are almost not affordable for regular fans anymore, it wouldn't hurt the clubs to give a little back sometimes. Not saying they should slash prices by 80% and make the queues go up by 200k people, but at the very least don't raise them."
Goosebumps. Every single time.
I like dark humour. This is fucking crisp. 
Mine was about £490 this season and it's going up another £50 for next.
All we can assume it that next season it's AT LEAST £51.
"As business guru Ehab Allam's father once said ""I don't believe people should pay to watch any sport, like the air that we breathe, it should be free."""
That's if you're first in there. All prices for this season outside official Liverpool FC sources are at least £80+. Watford is the cheapest game this season remaining.
"Birthday present for my dad, he's a big England fan, doesn't really support a club, he watches every prem/cup game to see the England nationals play really. I think he loves Harry Kane more than me.

So birthday, fathers day, xmas I buy us tickets for England, go to Wembley with him, and because it's a present I get decent seats. If you are at the back in the upper tier at Wembley, it's such a big stadium, you are so far away from the pitch, you can't even make out which player is which, you want to get out of the stadium quickly because 30 seconds longer in the stadium adds 30 minutes to the queue to get to the station."
"Yeah, you're probably right. Just saw a couple of comments praising Marinakis so I decided to give some more info for those who are not familiar with him. 

"
"True, it’s definitely a dream of mine"
"Oh yeah for sure, but I’m just saying I hear people saying they wish more young fans would go to the games "
"And with it comes sales on things like concessions, merchandise, and increased ad revenue from higher gates, etc. It all adds up and possibly covers any loss from a reduced ticket price. "
OK Google. Find me burns units in Gijon
that's the thing. I don't get how this is impressive
"we don't either, we  have almost 25k season ticket holders even after being relegated"
"I get the joke and all, but for the seats I usually picked when we played in the premier league, it was £26ish (I think). Checking now, normal price seems about £25. If we go down and don't lower the prices I think a lot of people will just stop coming."
Not defending it but the fact is that most lower league clubs rely entirely on their ticket revenue stream. In comparison to premier league clubs who are raking in millions though TV and tickets make up a much smaller part of their revenue stream
"Correct you are sir. It's bullshit, but I'm gonna continue paying mine for the foreseeable future. The basic Arsenal membership is Red membership which gives you access to only certain games and the seats are always shit (the bulk of members are red members I think).

Luckily for me, I'm a silver member which gives access to all games and also earlier access to ticket releases than red members. The only way you can transition from red to silver is either by having a junior gunner membership before you're 16 (which automatically turns into silver once you hit 18), or for a current silver member to decide against renewing their membership, bumping a red member up in the queue for silver membership.

That last occurrence is so rare though as silver members rarely give up theirs.

We're being extorted by our club and they then wonder why why we have the gall to dare criticise the running of it."
"Just wait until they get whiff of personal seat licenses.

I've said too much already"
United do the same thing. 
Reminds me of how a portion of NFL teams charge seat licenses for season ticket holders
Although if we go up. Everyone who had a season ticket this year has theirs next year for free.
"Yeah but Reading have extra cheap tickets, most of the championship teams have more expensive tickets than Derby. Plus if we get promoted we are getting our season tickets free!"
"I believe it is at the upper end of prices but not in the top 5 most expensive Championship teams (might be wrong, going from memory)."
Why?
"Yeah mate haha, I was just saying in comparison to the guys point where he said some champ clubs charge around the mid Hundreds range for 18-23’s etc. etc. 

I love my club, even though it drives me mad, and I’m more than happy to pay the prices for the ST lmao, no matter what they charge. "
"I'm not! In Canada, the baby boomers are the ones with all the money. They lived in prosperous economic times, many invested well, and they worked during a time when most employers offered decent pensions. Add that to the ~$10,000/year most receive from the Canada Pension Plan, and the case for seniors discounts becomes indefensible imo. 

For comparison, I'm a university student who worked full time from April-September and part time during the school year. Just got my T4 yesterday. Total earnings for the 2017 tax year? $11,454. I need fucking discounts, not them. "
"Boooo!

Just kidding, Trent's a lovely uni. I wish this deal was in place while I was at UoN, my brother and I always talked about catching some Forest games but never got around to it. "
"Honestly it's possible, shame it's not worked and I'm a spurs fan "
"Think it was a step up too soon and also we had an issue with far too many lightweight players that got pushed around, no protection for him to play his game.

He’s only on loan and will be returning to a much more balanced squad so we’ll see what happens when he comes back."
"Thanks. He came at the perfect time to appease us when we were all at a miserable point after offloading Madine (something I never thought I'd say!)

I'm hoping Tyler Walker pays off too! Doesn't take a genius to see he has potential. Hopefully we'll deliver him back to you in prime condition, ready for your promotion chasing campaign in August 😁"
You know a town is nice when all the locals call the place 'Stabbo'. 
Jesus some of the people you see in Stapleford...
City Ground is right by one of the most middle class and nicest areas though 
"I wouldn't even put Stapleford in the top 10 worst parts of Nottingham, plenty of worse areas!"
[deleted]
Stabbo isn't that bad!
"Sorry mate, couldn’t resist the easy joke!

I had a great night out when I visited Nottingham, the wounds healed over dead quick so at least the knives are kept clean!"
"He supports Liverpool, most likely from Norway or something"
I support United but I live in Bradford I can frequently go to Bradford games so I do.
"Oh well, small team small mindset I guess"
Do me a favour and eat at Wok & Go so I can live vicariously through you. I used to eat there nearly every day but there isn't one in Glasgow :(
"Haha, first year after graduating is difficult to adjust to. I really struggled (but I had other stuff going on too). Like I looked back on my bank statements from that year and there were so many transactions for train tickets to and from Notts. It tends to be because you still have lingering connections there (mates doing Post Grads, in years below or doing longer degrees) but it does disappear, don't worry. I mean, I still have connections but they're not as strong and you kind of realise you have to move on at some point. Definitely be going back for an Ocean or Crisis at some point if I can, even though tickets are becoming harder and harder to come by. Long-winded post, but my passion for the place beats all. "
"Same man, going to miss this place :("
Ocean Fridays <3
It's brilliant for a lot of specific stuff. Journalism Post Grad and stuff like that are some of the best in the country. 
My condolences. 
"I had a great time at the UoK, Canterbury is such a weird mix of new and old.

Although, it’s been in the papers recently for all the wrong reasons. "
"No need for that, he was only asking a question!"
Ben Brereton wasn’t even born when we were last in the prem. Isn’t that depressing?
"Damn, he was really good in the u19 euro :("
"It's still £20 for adult home matches. I want to take my kids as I grew up watching tranmere, but its just too expensive. The next game is against Eastleigh. "
First game of the season is brilliant after having it bottled up inside you for months!
"I feel sad for those that don't! What a boring life. I guess it's just not the same kind of funny when you have a kid on your own. At least not when it's this fresh, so to speak. Just my opinion though.


Hey, how many babies does it take to paint a wall? 


Depends on how hard you throw it.."
"Yeah but that's nothing to do with the club, if you buy from a tout you are going to get ripped off. Also you can still buy tickets for at least 5 games at normal prices if you're a local fan"
"Quite a few were sceptical when he came in. He's pretty much completely taken a backseat, handed over to a chairman and his trusted CEO, and only appeared at 1 or 2 matches.

Still not entirely comfortable with him as owner, but most people won't complain until he does something untoward that effects Forest directly, or some of the allegations in Greece are proven in court."
Absolutely bud it would be great to see the new generation blooded in
"It's impressive relative to the prices Brits pay for season tickets at other clubs, and it is a good thing that they are lowering the season tickets as much to allow young people to get into the sport more and get some young blood in the fanbase, which helps massively when you're a smaller club especially these days where all young people are supporting the Man City's and PSG's of the world and not their local club."
That's neat and all but England are a rip off country football wise and any step in the right direction is an important one
Looks like a lot of people already have
"As a Coventry City fan (and former season ticket holder) I can tell you that is exactly what happens. There comes a point where the balance of ‘I love my club and would follow them wherever, whenever’ shifts to ‘How much are they charging for crap quality football?!’ and the cost starts to significantly outweigh any benefit. 

Of course it doesn’t help with loyalty when the ownership shits all over the fan base and moves the club to Northampton for a year either..."
When I go watch Blackburn it’s £27 and that’s in league 1! What a joke. Hospitality is £45 which isn’t so bad though. 
Less telly money means high ticket prices unfortunately. 
">Luckily for me..

If you say so"
"That's absolutely appalling. I'm guessing the reasoning is something like making sure tickets go to fans, rather than people attending for a one off or something?"
Was it like this before Kroenke too?
Kroenke already knows this. But i think he will have a hard time sucking Arsenal fans dry of more money for the foreseeing future. 
Emirates has already been built so it's harder for him to justify just practices. Ofc no one should be surprised if he tries.
I like this promotion. Good on them!
"For free? Or at the current rate? 

Giving away 21k free season tickets seems mental "
Ayy probs going to UoN next year. This season ticket seems like a nice deal.
On the plus side you guys have Rock City. Love that place.
I always heard it referred to as ‘Shottingham’ which always made me chuckle.
“People” 
Nice away day. Still got a hooters?
"It's technically not even Nottingham, its in West Bridgford which is in Rushcliffe Council, not Nottingham City Council. 

It means Notts County is not in the county of Notts as they're in Nottingham which is not part of Nottinghamshire and Nottingham Forest isn't in Nottingham or near a Forest for that matter.

Really should swap the names around. "
Yeah it’s hardly the meadows is it. 
Fuck George Spencer
"Like these Norwegian guys are for Everton, such up to date fans they are still using Lukaku as their title image? http://evertonfc.no.datasenter.no/"
"There's one next to the jubilee campus, I'll make the journey there"
Not a better night out than at ocean
Aye. I think they won Uni of the Year last year too. Not that that award probably means much. 
"Could be worse, I went to Canterbury Christchurch uni "
"Fucking love Canterbury man, awesome town with some great bars and sports. 

Been about a decade since I was there, what has been in the papers for?"
"Extremely.
Also these £100 tickets for 23 years olds won’t even remember a time when we was in there."
Christ.. its 20 quid for me to go see Cardiff... that's mental. 
Christ dead baby jokes is it now SemenDemon. 
That's was a tad bit forced 
"But I'm not a local fan. I'm not on an L postcode. If I want to watch my boyhood club I have to fork out £80+ quid, as the only tickets available are from outside official LFC. 

Unless I am able to buy tickets at the prices you say. If I am then please send me a link where to buy lol."
Stop man!! He's already dead. 
"Well no shit? Forking out massive amounts to see your side not win at home for a year, what a surprise."
"There was a rumour you were coming to MK next season, you certainly enjoyed the place in the cup. "
Touché.
"That probably has a lot to do with it, but my issue isn't so much that there's a membership fee, it's that the annual price is 50 to 60 quid, just feels like one of the richest clubs in the world is taking the mickey out of us.

They could charge 10-20 quid and I'd have no issue, but as it's 50-60 then that adds up to 500 to 600 over 10 years before I even *go to a game*. Tack onto that that we have the most expensive tickets of any club on the planet I believe, makes you wonder why we continue through it.

Football most definitely ain't the working class man's game anymore."
"Yeah, but not to the same extent. We can't blame all our problems on Kroenke, but he's probably made it worse."
"The maximum ticket is GBP645 a year, so even at that rate, they'd only be down 13m a year. If you look, an average ticket is probably about GBP400, so they'd be down about 8m. Given that they'd earn a minimum of 40m from TV rights alone, they'd still be way up on the equation, so it's a great promotion to get people to buy tickets.

It's not impossible that they'd also take out an insurance policy on that eventuality as well."
"For free.

"Gone downhill a bit these days. 

Still a top night out though "
Prefer Rescue Rooms myself tbh
Rock City bitch
I went on a night out with my mates sister at her uni in Bristol. One of her mates said her Dad completely banned her from going to a Nottm university due to the gun crime. So dumb.
It's called Stabbo for a reason
Only one in the UK I believe. The sign down the road says “dangerous curves ahead.” 
"Unlimited wings on a Monday. 

Beautiful. "
My girlfriend works at that Hooters!
"> or near a Forest for that matter

The club was actually named after the Forest Recreational Grounds in Nottingham, rather than any actual forest, for all you trivia fans out there."
That was the one. It quickly got to the point they didn't even need to ask what my order was even though it was a custom box. I miss it a lot!
"Seeing all these familiar names is making me so nostalgic, particularly on such a global sub. I lived near that particular Wok and Go in first year. "
Yeah that’s definitely worse 
"Been some horrible campus incidents in recent times. A couple of girls got attacked after the university nightclub closed as they were going back to their halls and a fresher died on her first night last September.

The city is still buzzing but there’s been a bit of a somber tone hanging around the university."
"To be fair, there isn’t much worth remembering unless you go back to 94/95! "
The edge is strong with this one 
Couldn't resist lol.
Okay?
"I pay £95 for class A games at the emirates, direct from the club"
"We bottomed out around ~18000 on midweeks and ~20000 on Saturdays in league 1.

That said we don't have much local competition to defect to, Sunderland aren't as fortunate. We lost more fans to Leeds Rhinos than anywhere else.

The catch 22 is you've got players on big money so can't reduce the ticket prices but the tickets are too expensive so nobody comes. Vicious circle with no easy answer."
I think MK has stolen its fair share of clubs from their homes for one lifetime. 
"At the top level, definitely not. It isn't much better in the Championship either these days.

£50-60 could get you to a couple of matches at least down here though, as opposed to allow you the right to buy a ticket!"
Rather go to stealth if I'm in that area
Ah that's a shame. Haven't been in about 4 years since last time I was on a tour.
I hope that wasn't recently. Birmingham is where you want to avoid if gun crime is so important to you.
"I grew up in Stabbo, not been back for 15 years or so... did it go downhill so fast? Or did I just not notice?"
flair checks out
In my first year (2015/16) I lived directly opposite that Wok & Go when they were giving away one free box in exchange for a leaflet they gave out. They had hundreds of them. Me and some of my mates stole a tonne of 'em and just gave them away to people. We all ate for free for about a month 
You know you are shit when fans turn to another sport altogether
"Who do you think Sunderland would lose fans to? Can see a few people starting to go and watch South Shields or Spennymoor a bit more, but there's absolutely no chance anyone would defect to the Mags or Boro"
Where do London Wasps play?
Probs a better quality of football at Preston too at the moment lol
"Oh yes, bringing back some great memories! I loved Stealth for the albeit short time that I was living in Nottingham. 

Everybody's gurnin' haha! I swear they sell more bottles of water than they do alcoholic beverages!"
I fucked my right ear up in stealth 
Depends if you're feeling ketty or not. 
"Nah I'm talking about 5 years ago. Even then though, it was all just bollocks "
"There was a shop called ""The Glory Hole"" which sold boutique furniture for a bit, but they changed the name because middle aged women were upset at the Google results from ""the glory hole in stapleford""

This is not a joke."
"Nah I don't get this. You know Stabbo, it's not glamorous but it's hardly the worst area of Nottingham."
"They only let her work in the kitchen 🙁
"
Raleigh Park? 
"There are no other football teams within a decent distance of Leeds. Bradford were in League 2 and Hudds with us in League 1 at the time.

Meanwhile Leeds Rhinos are the most successful team in their sports' history (in this country). Their tickets are/were cheaper and you can drink beer on the terraces. I can see the attraction."
"Boro *haemorrhage* fans whenever they get relegated Prem > Champ. 

It's not losing fans, more new fans not starting to watch them. Kids don't want to go to see League 1 football when they can watch manyoo on the telly. That's the way it is."
Nobody cares about egg chasing.
"Haha, you'd be surprised! We're not too far off you lot actually. Some weeks we can spend 90 mins passing it around beautifully without actually achieving anything :P"
Hahah trust its just bottles of water and cans of red stripe. 
Stealth is literally just a drug den lmao
Ketty is my middle name
I don’t think it was ever as bad as they made out. I did grow up there so I may be biased. 
"Always worth a giggle growing up there, it was right on the main street too, across from Lidl.

Although the pedant in me would have to tell you that it was actually in Sandiacre rather than Stabbo by about 100 yards haha"
"That's kinda what I thought. It just felt like a standard kind of area, not like the Meadows or St Anne's..."
F
"I cleaned the flats there one summer, it was grim going. "
">Their tickets are/were cheaper and you can drink beer on the terraces

The 2 pinter they sell is a big draw, I tell you."
Wait they have standing terraces? And you can drink beer? I'm switching sports too!
"Visited a friend in Leeds a couple summers back. Went to a Rhinos match, drank double pints of beer. 13/10 would do again."
"Unfortunately I'm from Wakefield so I couldn't even turn to rugby league at one point because of how shit the then Wildcats were.

After the note he tried very hard to get the card, and succeeded in doing so after 2-3 attempts

"> He's been a machine, can't remember the last time we had such a solid injury-free player

Supposedly he's actually played (been playing?) through minor injuries, as well.  It really is impressive how much of a beast Matic has been.  Glad he gets a few days' rest this week."
"Him and McTominay were immense in the midfield against Chelsea, Chelsea only got joy when they targeted Ashley Young on the flanks, every time they tried going central they usually got dispossessed."
He struggled a bit recently but was back to his very best against Chelsea.
I don't understand why Chelsea sold him to you...
"He’s been pretty poor for weeks, started well but failed off"
When he played at Benfica i stated several times on portuguese  football blogs that he was the most complete midfielder that had passed on Portuguese league since i started watching it. People often made fun of me.
He was incredible last game but he hasnt been all that great during our rough patch of games. Im so glad he turned it up for this crucial match
"He has had a few poor games in my opinion. Not atrocious, but in a few games he’s not been as solid as people are making out. "
Glad our next game against Palace is on Monday. Gives all the players plenty of time to recover and go again.
He's from Serbia mate. 
How has a meme that was created yesterday already degraded so much? 
Shut up u egg
It was only his fifth of the season and therefore won't incur a suspension as the bookings accumulation count is reset at the end of December.
"If the instruction was to be carded then they wouldn’t have needed a note to communicate it. It was quite clearly a tactical instruction since Bailly had it explained in detail by Mourinho, Matic and Lindelöf both got the message and we switched up our formation."
Why would Mou write that down? That's something Bailly could have told him right away. 
He did it with Madrid and even got fined for it. Instructed some players to pick up a second yellow in the 5th group stage game. They'd top their group even if they lost the last game but they then go into the ro16 with no accumulated yellows. 
can someone ELI5 for me? why do that when mou can just not play him against whomever they're facing next?
"Jodi Alba's repeated attempts at this were possibly the most notable I've ever seen on Saturday against Girona. He just started trying to grab opponents as they were running. Eventually succeeded in receiving his booking and gave the ref a thumbs up. On a serious note though, as the commentators pointed out, it could lead to an injury to an opponent."
He's Serbian.

I'd say at that level almost all players are playing with some niggling injury.
Why does it feel like almost all of United's good games against big teams recently come from flooding the midfield?
"I think it went unnoticed how well Smalling and Lindelof played against Morata.

They didn’t start well but after 30 minutes he literally didn’t get a sniff and they won every duel against him pretty much.

Morata just kept going to ground and claiming a free kick."
Our only goal came from that kids mistakes though
"Yeah, both ran their socks off. Worked well in tandem as well, one pressuring the player with the ball, the other trying to close down channels. And it showed, Chelsea's passing deteriorated as the game progressed."
"It seemed very apparent to me that it's a fatigue issue, he's a nailed on starter every game for us. I was really concerned for him the last few minutes of the Sevilla game especially with the Chelsea game coming up not long after. Man deserves a lengthy break before the WC."
"He wanted out, only way we would've got him. Also, Abramovich always grants the wishes of players that have given the club a lot so they let him walk."
He wanted to leave so they let him leave as goodwill for his services 
"With Bakayoko coming in, he felt that his gametime would be very limited and asked to leave."
"Yes, since around Xmas he's looked knackered."
"He carried the brunt of our december schedule, it's a miracle he didn't get injured. It was a muscle injury waiting to happen, but he pulled through."

Feel like it should be a rolling reset thing tbh. Like if you get four yellow cards in December you shouldn't have it reset in January. Maybe something like yellows from ~14 games or more ago don't count?

"because then if Matic gets a yellow in the Liverpool game, he misses the **next** game as well. this way, Matic only misses the game he was going to miss anyway."
"Even if we rested him, he'd still be sitting one card away from a suspension and risk future games. So you can essentially choose which game they miss, and then his booking count is reset for all future matches."
"How do people not understand this simple thing,it's being asked by everyone it seems"
Doesn’t beat Suarez’ unsucessful attempt haha
"I think with shirt pulling you can probably get a yellow card with minimal risk of injuring someone. 

In any case you could just pick up a yellow by time wasting on a corner or free kick or throw in."

"It is, but it's made out of horse meat."
That's some wonderful Icelandic directions you're got.
"Typical, this club is nothing but people tagging along for the glory and glamour fixtures."
"I can't find it right now, but if I recall Mourinho came out at one point and praised Matic for playing through injury for United.

I'm with you - most play through niggling injuries - just not used to a manager singling one player out for pushing through.  Could be wrong - just assumed that meant it was probably more significant than most."
"My foot hurts a bit but I just get on, mustn't grumble."
"No, they are superhuman. 

None of them wake up with their back hurting at all. "
"People who annoy you 

Nigglers and their niggling injuries"
"Maybe because we actually have 2 pivots down there who are disciplined and can hold position, I personally don't think Pogba should be fielded in the deep CM role unless its a bad team because he roams everywhere.

Just look at the Tottenham game where Matic and Pogba were the deep duo, Matic was basically playing 1v3 and being hounded everywhere by the Spurs while Pogba was roaming around like a headless chicken."
"What games? We switched from a double pivot to a 4-3-3 after the Spurs game (though it was more like a diamond against Chelsea). It is a big part of why we looked so clueless recently.

Chelsea was the first game we've played this way against a top PL team and the first time we actually looked stable. Second half was very LVGesque (and he was good in the big games before anyone bemoans that comparison).

Anyway hopefully it means Mourinho is adapting going forward. I cannot imagine he's taking a risk with McTominay on a whim. If he's relying on such a young player it means he feels he has no alternative but to run with a 4-3-3. Goodness knows what this means for Herrera though. We are already losing Carrick and possibly Fellaini in the summer. Herrera is playing ""gone in the summer"" levels of games but I'm not sure we can afford to replace 3 midfielders in one window."
"Lindelof was organising the whole defence. You could see him telling Smalling where he should be, who he should be covering etc. I'd have preferred if Smalling had learnt enough about football to not need to be led by Lindelof but I'm happy Lindelof's confidence has been so much better since his initial run of bad games."
They covered each other's mistakes really well too.
"Fair point, him not tracking Willian all the way was definitely a mistake. But then which young player doesn't make mistakes? Hell, the entire Arsenal team is filled with seasoned veterans and they sometimes play like headless chickens"
Tell that to Diego Costa

Why'd you do that when you can literally just type Matic and Google will do the rest for you?
"Nah, both.

But yeah, he plays for Serbia"
both under adidas
I’m not sure. You could be right 
It's rare in England but some people say it. Mostly older people in my experience (like over 50s)
Some people say it in English but it's more common with Spanish speakers
oh good one 
I like horse meat. Apparently. 
That's a nice SWAT reference you got there
Robbie Dale is a mercenary... practically Neymar.
I remember that too. In a pre match press conference Jose said Matic was injured but he would play. It was one of the matches Pogba was injured/suspended for
"After a year and a half it's pretty fair to say that about him but I think it's a bit ridiculous that an experienced midfielder like him is so poor at positional awareness when not in possession. Yesterday he was better but so often you can watch him for minutes at a time without him looking around him. Just watching the ball and moving accordingly, not monitoring runs behind or around him. "
I’m sure Mou would have wanted to play Herrera but he picked up an injury against Sevilla. 
"I could see Fellaini signing a one year extension imo, seems like something that'd happen"
"> Goodness knows what this means for Herrera though.

Mm I don't see a conflict here. I know people are high on Mctominay, but I think we have a clean sheet yesterday with Herrera instead of McTominay. Herrera is the perfect partner to Matic to play behind like that. The only nag I have on McTominay right now (and he's young of course so he's looking solid for the future) is his energy. 

The biggest struggle we had in the first half was Hazard, McTominay couldn't keep up with Hazard and Willian and they were snagging every loose ball in the midfield. Herrera is an energizer bunny, and at times we needed that. We needed him diving in for those loose balls with a full head of steam.

He also would have tracked Willian on that goal.

A midfield with Pogba/Matic/Herrera with McTominay as the sub is a good start. We have Sanchez/Martial/Lukaku up front with Lingardinho and Rashford as subs.

If we keep the 4222 diamond like we did yesterday (it was more 4222 than 433 in my opinion, especially in the 2nd half when we were dominating possession), really our only weakness is wingbacks. When healthy Bailly, Jones, Lindelof look to be a solid trifecta.

So buying wingbacks looks to be the move. Otherwise with the right formation I'm pretty happy. I think my biggest doubt sadly is that Martial can play that role competently next to Lukaku, he's way too complicated and wants to walk it in on net.   

But setting up a 4231 just so we can get Sanchez and Martial on the wings has been killing us."
To be honest I think it's incredibly impressive for a kid his age to make a mistake like that and go on to play the game he did. He's got the right mentality and keeps doing what he needs to do. He even made some more ambitious passes and found Lukaku for his assist to Lingard.
"He was unprofessional almost his entire time here, Matic on the other hand was very professional. Still feels like something happened that he wanted out, but haven't heard a reason why from any source. "
They had probably the most prized young goalkeeper in the world at the time.. he had to leave. 
I don't think it's crazy at all. It makes Chelsea an attractive place to go for players. Work hard and do well and they will repay you letting you leave if you want. It encourages players to come in and give their all because Chelsea will work with them in return.
"Chelsea have always done this. Can't argue with their track record. The truth is Cech to Arsenal or Matic to United is a problem for teams challenging for 4th place. Chelsea obviously don't see this as an issue for them.

I mean they might be wrong this time but normally they'd be thinking ""even if United finish 1st/2nd we'll be 3rd and the others can bemoan one fewer place to fight over""."
"Its not crazy, its actually a really honourable way of doing business. "
Yeah that was probably partially the reason we let Giroud walk. Favor in good faith and Giroud also was a great servant for us/ wanted to stay in London just like Cech
"The Cech one makes more sense because he wanted to stay in London for his family. Also he is a legend and seems like a stand-up guy. 

I do not understand the Matic one at all. "
"You laugh now but that was precisely why, Matic asked to leave as soon as Bakayoko was signed, it came out of nowhere, everybody thought Baka would've been eased into the team slowly with Matic as 1st choice. Whether he didn't want competition or felt he was underappreciated, we'll never know."
lol 20C is like my Winter here
Every winter you get two weeks of temperatures colder than -5. It's normal. But it doesn't last the entire winter. 
"Belarus here. -23 reporting for duty, not even a North country, but we usually have -10/20 in winter and +30/35 in summer. Crazy."
"They're having a cold snap, looks like normal weather next week. "
"News flash, winter is cold and summer is warm. The way the guy spoke made it seem like Serbians are some northern Scandinavians who revel in the cold. Just because it’s cold in fucking February doesn’t make Serbia a cold country. I’m sure the people there aren’t going outside in this weather. "
IMO this shows how stupid that rule it is. That you can game the rule to minimize impact...? And from the start the impact doesn't even affect any of the teams you get the yellow against.  
I wasn't repeating anything. I was answering the guys question about why any manager would do this with a player.

"I can guarantee if PSG give Robbie the money to buy out his contract with us our chairman won't try and ignore it. He loves it when money is coming in rather than going out. We'd show Barcelona the proper, classy way to lose a star player."
Wasn't it the Arsenal game?
"Yep. Pretty sure that's what I was recalling - many play through niggling injuries, but most of those aren't significant enough to merit being mentioned by the manager in the presser."
"Its gotta be a choice.  Pogba chooses to not be disciplined defensively, he’s certainly mentally and physically capable of being at least an average to good defensive midfielder."
"I don't think he's not ""aware"". I think he's selfish and trying to play how he wants and not how the team wants him to."
Maybe. The primary issue remains his wage demands though. His position in the squad is similar to Lingard who's on £75k/week. Fellaini wants £170k/week. That is a big gulf to cross.
I think he is/was one of the united key player he could play defending attacking and even could score goals. i love/d him in the pitch despite all those bad stuff throwing on him about his game.
"Mourinho obviously disagrees that Herrera is a replacement for McTominay. He had the option of going to this system if Herrera was viable. He resisted doing so and eventually decided to take it on with McTominay as his first choice option (and he made that call before Herrera got injured against Sevilla).

I'm not the one saying McTominay is the business. I'm trying to judge the thought process of Mourinho in the selections he's made. If you are going to try out a new system, all sense screams not to do it with a youngster. Particularly if you have Herrera available. Him going with McTominay is a huge signal he doesn't rate Herrera.

As for diamond v 4-3-3. There isn't really that huge a difference between the two systems. The major difference is the central player sits lower than the wider strikers. It is a difference in small details rather than functionally."
"He's still being professional towards Chelsea, too.  He was interviewed post-match yesterday, and had this to say when people started questioning his ""motivation"" to play against his old club:

> ""I don't want to speak about why I left Chelsea. I will keep that to myself. I'm happy in Manchester and that's it. Moving to United was good for me. I play for a big club.""

http://www.espn.in/football/english-premier-league/story/3398891/man-uniteds-nemanja-matic-didnt-have-anything-to-prove-to-chelsea"
"> Still feels like something happened that he wanted out, but haven't heard a reason why from any source.

I thought it was because of how cavalier you lot were being about eventually replacing him with Bakayoko? I remember Chelsea fans commenting about how Matic was supposed to groom Bakayoko into playing his role."
"That was a very weird situation. Cech, at the time, was still a beastly GK and Curtois was, well, Curtois. Very tough choice, but one of the two had to go. "
He wanted to leave the year before since he was dropped by Hiddink for Mikel but i recall reading an article saying that Juve were in for him but Conte told him to stay and he did
Lucky
Cheers for the news flash. No he didn't make it seem like that you just inferred it. Fairly obvious he just meant Serbia is colder than England - which it is.

"I kind of remember him playing in a more attacking role at Juventus, I've never really seen Pogba as someone who would be happy to see his stats saying:
 
- 0 goals

- 0 assists

- 7 defensive interceptions

- 9 tackles

and being happy with the above..."
"> Fellaini wants £170k/week.

No fucking way.... do you have Chinese/Arab bids for him? No one is paying that much for him otherwise."
"Fellaini's delusional if he thinks he's gonna get 170k. He's probably our 4th/5th choice midfielder, or used as a last resort. You don't give 170k to a last resort."
"> He had the option of going to this system if Herrera was viable. He resisted doing so and eventually decided to take it on with McTominay as his first choice option

Maybe. I think at Sevilla he was going to run this system with Matic/Herrera right? But McTominay in to give Pogba a rest. I believe if Herrera wasn't hurt he would have been in McTominay's spot. Especially with how Herrera hounded Hazard last year."
"I believe that was part of the reason he asked to leave last summer, while he also asked to leave the previous summer, supposedly because Kante was arriving. 

But it seems odd to me that someone so professional would want to leave because of competition, especially with Chelsea winning the title and loads of European games coming up, so I get the impression something else was going on behind the scenes, or in his personal life maybe?"
"And given that Courtois was much younger, it was always going to be him - and it is entirely fair to say Cech has significantly declined since leaving. Cech displaced Cudicini in a similar way (although there was a difference in class between Cech and Cudicini that was wider than that between Cech and Courtois, Cudicini was still a very capable goalkeeper), but Carlo stuck around for longer than just the one year as a back-up."
"Overall, Serbia is not colder than England. Just because February winters hit European mainland harder than England doesn’t mean it’s colder overall.  In fact, I just gathered year round statistics: Average temperature of mainland England is 12.25 C while average temperature of Serbia is 12.5 C. And Manchester is definitely colder than the south of England so the average temperature is probably even lower there. So please tell me again how Serbia is a colder country than England."
It isn’t. Serbia average temperature is higher than England. 
Well clearly the guy was unaware. Which is why he responded directly to him.
You can't google from https://www.bing.com you silly
Yeah but the only correct one is Kölle.
"Ok, I get how that can be annoying. But was he speaking Spanish?"
In English Cologne would actually be correct.
"I don't see a downside to that, the satisfaction of eating food and all the fun of a mystery combined. You should win a prize if you can correctly guess what animal the meat is from."
"We all have aspects of our jobs we don’t love though, imo the measure of a man is how we do what has to be done instead of just doing what we want to do."
"No bid needed, he's out of contract in the summer.  It's pretty well established he's had offers from Turkish clubs (with much lower taxes) that would likely net out around the same.  170k in England is the same as 110k in Turkey.  Or 90k + 3M signing bonus with no club fee.  That's a pretty reasonable number for Fellaini, actually.  Half the PL would jump at the chance to sign him that cheap.

"
"Nah, it's just the number United would need to offer for him to stay.  If he's got an offer from a Turkish club for 90k/3 years + 3M sign-on fee, that's the same as 170k in the UK. Taking a pay cut to be a bench player is a no-go."
I saw it more that Herrera was allowing Pogba to rest but it is hard to be sure. He hasn't used Herrera much all season.
this is an argument well worth your time and effort.
"Continental Europe has more ""extremes"" than Britain. Just taking the first comparison site I found, Belgrade is colder than Manchester through December/January/February and warmer through the rest of the year.

"In the coming 3 days, which is what this post is talking about as its Matic's supposed time off, Serbia will be a colder country than England."
"> So please tell me again how Serbia is a colder country than England.

The coldest days in Serbia are colder than the coldest days in England. More extremes. 

You don't get a much more temperate weather region than the UK and Ireland."
Not for Winter
"Ok, you're retarded and I will stop now."
"Yes, Spanish with some portuguese words"
And the prize is more mystery meat 
"We've offered him contracts, he's declined time after time. If he's got good offers from Turkey, he should go. I really like fellaini but as a club we shouldn't be bending over for squad players. Giving a huge pay rise to a 5th choice centre mid is a no-go too."
Any new contract will almost certainly have a signing fee anyway. I doubt this is at issue.
"I agree it's a little hard to tell. We also didn't play the way we played yesterday against Chelsea outside of that run against Watford/Arsenal where we went 3 ATB and 2 up top with Pogba forward.

I think McTominay/Herrera could both be used depending. 

If we're against a team with a Hazard/Messi/etc. I'd prefer Herrera. But we will see what Mourinho does. I really just hope we keep that formation for the rest of our games."
"I’m just tired of the brigading on this sub and wanted to call people out on their bullshit. Yes, I realize the topic was stupid and yes I’m bored at work. "
He's tilted as fuck about some cold Serbians lmao
"Yes, but that wasn’t his argument. He was saying that magic should be acclimatized to the cold weather of England because Serbia is colder even though matic would more than certainly not be spending those few cold months outdoors or anything. People buckle themselves away for those few brittle months and come out of their shells once the much more manageable warm seasons come around. "
That isn’t what this post is talking about. It’s hinting that matic would be acclimatized to the cold of Manchester because of his upbringing in Serbia which is just wrong. Serbia is warmer than northern UK. A few data points in the death of winter don’t change that 
"Using that logic, the warmest days in Serbia are warmer than the warmest days in England, therefore he should be even more bothered by the cold. "
"well the assumption was that Matic wouldn’t be affected by the Manchester weather since he’s clearly so used to the cold, when really it’s only the brittle winter that is cold in Serbia which does not involve much going outside. The rest of the year is far more manageable temperature-wise hence he would indeed find the Manchester weather cold and would like a warm vacation. Sorry for being pedantic but everyone is downvoting and I need to call you all out on your bullshit. "
Thank you
Like the reverse of Portuñol? Espanguês?
This is the gift that keeps on giving.
"I think we have been setting up to play that game against Chelsea, we've just not been able to do it. I'm utterly convinced Mourinho has actually made the tactical transition everyone has been bugging him for, he just didn't want to put a big sign shouting ""vulnerable football team"" in place."
"> matic would more than certainly not be spending those few cold months outdoors or anything. People buckle themselves away for those few brittle months and come out of their shells once the much more manageable warm seasons come around.

Mate what the fuck it's not Siberia, it's just a couple of degrees colder in Dec/Jan/Feb"
"I agree that the initial statement was wrong to claim that a Serbian would be used to the cold. That being said, Sabac, where Matic is from is definitely colder than Manchester at this time of year. Average high/low temperatures give a difference of between 3 and 6 degrees. 

. "
"No, that's a non-sequitur.

If you were to actually use the logic the conclusion would be that ""the warmest days in Serbia are warmer than the warmest days in England, therefore he would be very used to warm weather and not bothered by a hot summer in Manchester.""

Which is true."
Who hurt you?
spot on
"I hope so! I think I agree. I personally felt the Sevilla away game was a rest game, trying to hold because of the Chelsea game and it's implications in top 4.

I definitely hope we use the rest of the season to keep up this momentum, solidify 2nd and a deeper UCL run.

Then with a couple buys, next year is a new story. I know Mourinho knows what he's doing, I don't think he's antiquated or anything. But obviously he has to think of different things than we do as fans."
"Reading the replies to my original comment, you would think it was Siberia. People thing matic is some kind of weather tested Eskimo. Being born in Eastern Europe myself, the cold sucks and we don’t embrace it like most Nordic countries do so I don’t know where this idea comes from that Matic won’t be bothered by the Manchester cold. "
"Let’s take an extreme example: if every day in Serbia is warm except for one week which is a bitter -40, would you say the people of the country are used to the cold? I’m saying that the cold season isn’t such a substantial portion of their year such that it would affect their internal temperature like it does to some far north countries. Finnish people don’t even get fazed by freezing temps. "
"But there is a relationship between comfortable body temperature which will no doubt be higher for Matic because of the average overall temperature. I live somewhere where there are extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers. We all find the cold miserable because the warm temperatures are far closer to what we are comfortable with. I can bet you that the same holds true with Matic. Regardless, this is getting very silly. "
Serbian Winters
"That has to be the goal for the rest of the season. Get past Sevilla, hold 2nd, at least semis of the FA Cup.

If we win the FA Cup with the rest I'd call the year fantastic given where we were and the difficulty of the transition the last month or so."
"Naw, people just don't think that Matic needs to be given a parka, a puffer jacket, ski trousers and thermal underwear then wrapped in ten blankets before he's allowed outside."
"But serbian winters aren't cold and don't bother anyone and nobody in serbia gets used to cold weather because they ""don't go outside much in the winter""."
"> If we win the FA Cup with the rest I'd call the year fantastic given where we were and the difficulty of the transition the last month or so.

I agree, a win over Sevilla, another win in the FA Cup, hold 2nd. That would be success this year, and put us in good position for next year if we can spend in offseason. Shouldn't be losing anyone key to the team."
Did not read that conclusion anywhere...
"Its looking way too good for him, im afraid guys"
"His 39th time scoring the 1:0, a season-amount of times worth of being the difference maker. 

Pretty crazy imo, considering he missed like almost three full season through injury since his arrival in Dortmund. That goal is also a great example of his finishing and off the ball movement which Dortmund have been missing so badly, while he was injured"

Germany confirmed back-to-back World Cup winners with Reus back.
I've never wanted a player from a team I don't support to stay fit more than I have his lad. Come on Reusy stay fit for the world cup!
"Stay fit, baby ;)"
It's so nice seeing Reus back. 
He's been watching Firmino i see
"Love this guy, I hope he'll have more luck in the future"
"I love you Reus
"
"Has Reus ever been avarage when fit to play ? I swear, this guy would be in Ballon D'or contention every year if he could manage to stay fit."
So this reus lad is pretty good eh?
I will not get excited.
WC legend
Hope he stays healthy. Would love to watch him in the WC
Not sure if its the socks but Michy runs so goofy. Someone with hips so thicc shouldnt be moving them at that speed. 
"looks like he might have lost half a step at most, but his awareness there was just insane. Just imagine if he can stay healthy this time."
"Marco, please dont celebrate so hard, you'll get hurt."
You drank your milk didnt you marco
I'm so happy for him.
And that's you should always continue your run. Good man!

Its a damn miracle he always get back in form so quick as if he wasnt even injured.

It's like he's seen that Video of Mané trying to imitate these celebrations.
do you want to jinx it mate
he had no shot at saving it if he got up. If anyone screwed up in defense (other than giving it away in midfield so it's a 3 on 2 breakaway) it would have to be Danso. He was tracking reus back and then lost him in the box.

Technically it was a good start to the season ..
"The sample is really small, but according to my calculations he was on pace to score 204 goals on the season."
Pretty average tbf
big if true
What the actual fuck? Isn't Carrasco pretty young aswell?
what the fuck
Gaitan to United rumors can finally die... Right? 
"Dalian Yifang is actually owned by Dalian Wanda Group(not officially announced though),who used to be a minority shareholder of Atletico Madrid.Pretty sure that's the reason behind the transfers."
as a belgian this pisses me off immensely
"Career: Probably done.

Bank Account: Future Generations set for life."
"**Bag:**

So they have just a 19 man first team now? That's not a lot of depth
Go fuck yourself. I'm so pissed off.
Holy shit Carrasco is a brilliant signing!
[Damn it feels like yesterday](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l3Ucu4baDoPdv8Jiw/giphy.gif)
"Happy for Gaitan, he deserves the money.

3 years in China and then he goes back to Boca."
"Well, Carrasco's career was good while it lasted."
"Just doesn't feel right. Carrasco was scoring in the Champions League final less than two years ago. Even if his attitude and commitment isn't necessarily in check, I didn't think he'd take a Chinese pay day. "
Nico back home next winter then. Nice.
What a waste of talent
This is great for Djurgårdens IF! Will probably lead to Mushekwi leaving and hopefully joining us.
"I'd be a hypocrite to criticize Carrasco, nothing wrong with wanting to maximize your earning potential given football is a short career. Still young enough return to Europe one day if he wishes, good luck to him"
Any news on the fee?
"Welp, I hoped Atleti could keep Carrasco until the end of the season and sell him then for a bigger price"
I think that game vs RM made people seriously overrate Carrasco
This is how you ruin your career.
"Wtf, missed all the build up to this. Why the fuck have they gone there?!"
What a waste
Get the Superleague on FIFA 19
Carrasco nooo what are you doing
wtf really?
Feel free to prove me wrong but how strong is Atleticos winger depth? Surely this leaves them short on the wings?
What? 
"You can tell if a player has a true, proper hunger to win trophies and reach the pinnacle of the sport or not by whether they say yes to this type of deal. 

Oscar, Hulk, Carrasco clearly are only thinking of the money"
"Fucking livid. Gaitán can fuck off, fair enough, but Carrasco? Puta Gil & Puta Cerezo."
disgrace. I can't believe it..
"If we get good money for them, I am not exactly unhappy about this move. Carrasco has not contributed positively to Atleti since 2016 and Gaitan has been invisible.
On the other hand I have doubts we will make it in good shape till the end of the season, as it doesn't seem we have enough depth."
You can always be signed by Barcelona later...
Damn
HOLY SHIT WTF
Mad ting
What's the transfer fee?
"I know the focus here is them going to the chinese league, but what are Atlético de Madrid doing? Sure, they're out of Copa del Rey and it *looks* like they will finish second in La Liga, but right now they have a squad with only 17 players + 3 goalkeepers. Seems a bit risky. 

But yeah. With a few other players leaving, that means Atlético would probably need to sign at least five-six good players in the summer. "
"Everyone is saying its the end for their career... forgetting Paulinho? Belgium has a super chance of getting far in the world cup, I wouldn't be surprised if we see Carassco in a big team this time next year or two years from now"
"Really surprised Gaitan would do it for the money. He's a great player with amazing sportsmanship behavior, any club would be lucky to have him. "
"Fair enough Gaitan, but what a waste for Yannick"
"LaLiga is hemorraging players to the Chinese league this season. Just Carrasco, Bakambu, and Viera are three big stars that left this window. Hope it's not the beginning of the end for European football."
FIFA 19 better have the Chinese league 
2021: Carrasco to Barcelona
"Wow. Didn't see this coming. A shame to see a player of Carrasco's quality leave for China. But  he's still young so who knows. Weird for Gaitan as well.

I know it didn't affect Witsel, but do any Belgian redditors think this'll affect his WC chances?"
Oh shit!
Shit that was quick. 
Wow 
 No way 
Carrasco has been all but confirmed for a while but Gaitan too?? Just me or is that a surprise 
Wait what. I thought this was going to be for the summer?
The Carrasco one is still so odd to me... He is still an important player for them. The Gaitán transfer isn't a surprise though. Barely plays
Whaaat what happened to Carrasco I thought he was good on Athleti 
"Wasn't he linked to us so many times? 

Damn."

RIP Carrasco's career
"Chinese leaguje is where careers go to die. I mean seriously, look at Oscar. The dude hasn't been heard of in ages."
What’s the ACTUAL amount they received? 30&17Million seems way to cheap 
what the actual fuck
Holy shit I remember the Sun reporting this 2 days ago..
Haven't been this disappointed to see a player leave for China since Alex Teixeira. Does this help or hurt him securing a spot on the Belgian NT for the World Cup? Is his spot even in jeopardy?
Holy shit...
Could have been amazing additions to most teams in Europe. Imagine them playing for a midsize club in PL or La Liga. Would have been a ton of fun. This feels like a waste.
An important fact is that Wanda group (the previous Chinese investor in Atletico) is based in Dalian and is now going to own Dalian Yifang. So the transfers make some sense. Atletico doesn't seem to really need them now anyways huh? Should be good business for them.
carrasco is as nice player though
Career suicide IMO. 
"He’ll only be there for a year or two. Much like Southern Hemisphere rugby players do, play in France or England for a bit and earn top dollar then return."
"Well, I guess that's it for Gaitan to United. Shame, really!"
wtf is this mans doin
How has this happened :/ 
"I'm not that mad, because Carrasco play is very selfish and, although sometimes it helped the team, some other times the quality dropped because he could've done a great assist but he chose to shot to a barrier of defenders... Carrasco wasn't bad, but he put himself first istead of the team. And that makes sense with his decision. 

Torres didn't left because he loves Atleti. "
Yannick Carrasco is just 24. What is he doing going to the Chinese Super League?
Carrasco really went through with this move
"Wait can someone explain this please? Are they going to leave right now or at end of season? Why would Atletico let Carrasco go now? They are doing pretty good in La Liga, is he not playing?"
"I think other stuff other than technical ability often gets overlooked when we rate players. There's so much more to the game other than pure skill.

Carrasco hasn't shown any of the qualities of a top player during his time at Atletico other than raw talent. Selfish and with a terrible attitude and barely improved in any of these matters despite playing under a great manager that absolutely requires a commitment to the team from all of his players

I get that he's young and he might improve over the years, but why would any top team risk paying his high wages for inconsistent football, a bad presence in the locker room for a small chance he changes his ways and becomes what everyone expects of him?

I highly doubt a player like him would take a step down and go play for a smaller club for a chance of first team football. Bigger teams wouldn't take the risk and he would probably be a bench player at best. So China is actually a logical move when you consider all this, he gets to earn a shit ton of money without a lot of effort and without the responsibility of playing for a high stakes European side."
"Dear u/NacerChadli u/adnanjanuzaj, please do your best at your club, don't hurt yourself, and stay with us for the next couple of years.

Dear u/RobertMartinez, you can always play Eden on the left, with Dries Mertens somewhere around Romelu... With 4 defenders (instead of 3) that shouldn't cause a problem."
What the fffffuuuuccccckk?
Lifelong dream
Reason number 532 why the Red Devils aren't going to win anything. They would rather go to a silly club and just playing for the money instead of fighting for your spot at an European top club. what a mentality...
"Doyen at it again, Atletico's way to dodge FFP and Uefa does nothing."
"Carrasco is 24 1/2, scored a goal in the Champions League final less than a year ago...what a waste. "
"Honestly never liked Carrasco. Always thought he was insanely overrated. Remember that one run against Barcelona where he didn't even score and that was supposed to be the proof that he was amazing. I just couldn't get my head around it. I've seen so many youngsters make great runs, why is he so special? No surprise he never really improved. 

I admit he wasn't bad or anything. He did show some promise and was generally pretty alright. Still vastly overhyped, though. "
$$$
carrasco why....
wtf? Carrasco surely had a lot of european clubs interested in him! i don't understand at all how he chose to abandon his career at 24... o_O
Truly a huge waste of talent. I really like Carrasco too.
what a waste of talent
"Wow, what a weird move. Good for their $$$$ though."
wtf why? :(
Carrasco had so much promise 
They’ll be back in Europe within 2 years...
"Gaitan is already 30 and never really made a big impact in Madrid so it's somewhat understandable.

But Carrasco what the fuck, he's 24 and promising. If he wanted more money a PL club could have offered him just that. "
wtf carasco
"Glad that the Gaitán fiasco is over, i will never understand what happened there. He looked amazing for Benfica and never took off with us.

Carrasco though.. I really wish him the best, he seems to be a good kid and has a ton of potential, but it was exasperating to see him doing amazing runs, cutting though defences and then taking the worst possible decision and losing the ball. If he ever improves his decision making he'll become an amazing player, until then, he's not fit to be a star on a top league."
Y tho?
"Idiot, he's so young and can have a great career and then he does this."
huh that's weird 
"Carrasco is a really weird case for me. He seems really promising and technical, but still couldn't make it at ATM."
Whaaat? The Zayn Malik of football has moved to China? What is the world coming to. 
"I know it's for the money, but from a fan perspective, you just can't help by ask, ""Why?"". Would've love to see him in EPL, man.  

Why did Simeone start playing him less and less? This is something I cannot fully understand due to my lack of knowledge on Atletico Madrid (since we don't get the games here, except for CL). "
"Wait wait, what? Isn’t Carrasco good? "
FFS. What fucking bullshit is that.
"Eh wtf Carrasco? It's still way too early for you to be cashing in at some obscure club in China man.

I'm sure you could've played for a lot of other solid clubs in Europe if you didn't make it at Atletico Madrid or are unhappy there for some reason.

Disappointing news :("
"Why did Carrasco leave? I understand the Gaitan move, but Carrasco was excellent last season. I heard he wasn't playing much this season though, why did Simeone stop giving him gametime?"
"I don't get Carrasco. 

He's transferring from a top 3 team in one of the best leagues in the world, competing year after year in the Champions League against the best players in the world and living in Madrid, one of the best cities in the world to an unknown Chinese club.....

Wow, what a fucking waste of footballing time he's doing. "
Nico :(
What a waste of time that is!
"Carrasco can easily earn a shit ton of money in Premier with a club like Arsenal, why the fuck he go to China."
and we never heard from them again.
Yannick cashcow
"I honestly expected carrasco to join some other european team, this basically rules him out for starting at the world cup."
SuperMush...
welcome to /r/ChineseSuperLeague
Gaitan as well?? 
"Really sad about this. Both of these players looked like incredible talents and Carrasco still only 24. But you can see why Carrasco left considering Witsel is still starting for the NT while in China, although I would've wanted to see him play in Europe still."
welcome!

"Really disappointed with carrasco. He had the potential to be up there with the best in the world, but threw it all away for a few extra bucks. Always knew he was a shit head, but  what a waste of talent. "
**W O K E**
Reminds me of Gyan who tossed his career for money. 
Add that to the failed wonderkids list 
What a fucking shame that they gotta play there. Maybe some team can pull the trigger and buy Carrasco. Dude is still really young. 
What a waste
What a waste of your career
I feel like this is such a huge waste of talent.
"Well, at least this means that Atlético has some money to buy someone who can convincente Griezmann ti stay."
I can understand why he’s leaving but now? And at that price? No one on the squad offers the explosiveness that he could offer off the bench. Vitolo was gonna play whether he stayed or not. 
Imao I thought this was the name of a brand or a new agent.
How can they sell one of the best young talents in the world for just 30 million? I would love to have him at real for 40 million. 
"Perfect, as this halves his transfer asking price when Arsenal come snooping in for him to put the cherry on the the icing on the cake for our 2020-21 *""Invincible 2.0""* squad..."
wasted talent!!!
Wastemen
How did this transfer happen? The transfer window isn't even open.
Pretty young to suffer the back injuries from carrying all dat money.
24
Apparently he'll make €10 million a year. Hard to say no to.
Maybe he'll pull a Paulinho and come back strong after he gets tired of getting paid huge money for playing in a shit league.
Attitude problems
What a waste. I mean Carrasco of course. I'm sure a CL club would've come for him in the summer. But nothing beats crazy Chinese money.
"Carrasco I expected, but Gaitan too? "
I wonder how much they went for
"lmao this is exactly what i said when i saw this. it's is so sad tbh, so much potential wasted. "
Carrasco is not doing his professional career any favors. He's still 24 and the world cup is this summer.
Dalian Yifang is owned by the Wanda Group. Wanda’s majority shareholder (Wang Jianlin) owns 20% of Atletico......
"It’s the long con, he’s following In Paulinho’s footsteps."
could of atlas went to MLS
Accurate response 
I would give it a couple more days
Rumors? Those fuckers better pay us a percentage of the transfer fee. He was about to get his testimonial with us! 
Sneijder confirmed
He can still go on loan
Never
Pfft...back in my day it was Vicente constantly on the verge of joining United from the Iberian peninsula.
They could have Fernando Torres too. But it didn't happen.
"And Atletico Madrid's stadium is sponsored by Wanda Group, hence why it's called 'Wanda Metropolitano'."
I expected some shady shit when I saw a transfer involving us and a Chinese club damn it...
"It's announced, but regulations mean they can be in control until the new season. But yeah, pretty obvious they are behind it. "
Then this would be an inopportune moment to remind you that Roberto Martinez will be managing you at the World Cup. 
"He will join Juventus soon, don't worry."
"Sorry they can't hear you, they're too busy counting the money they will earn."
I feel like you have more star players than germany but they fuck up thenself. Radja would be sick for the nt and now belgian draxler/sane fucks off to second division level sunday league.

"You never know, he might be the next Paulinho. "
He'll realize it's fucking shit going to China at 24-25 and will return to a big European club
How is making far more money than you are worth the end of a career? If anything that's an insanely good career move.
He'll move after 12 months and go to some desperate mid level club or someone like West Ham

"True

But Carrasco could easily be replaced by Griezzman  Costa or Gameiro 

Not as big a loss as it could have been "
You talking to Me?
"He'll be back in maybe 2 years, after he loses his spot in the NT."
"I'm actually pissed of too, buddy. Limbombe is showing some talent, as is J. Lukaku if that helps?"
That same attitude is why we sold him in the first place.
Will probably get bored then move after a season like his colleagues. 
"What a waste, a woman that pretty in the dirty surroundings of China.

Oh and Carrasco's talent too."
"I like the way you think
"
"Don't worry, he will be at Stoke or West Ham in 12 months"
if atleti won that CL final then carrasco's celebration wouldve been so iconic
He's only gone for the money too; There's no way he's gonna win anything with Dalian - their homegrown players aren't even close to good enough. 
"Do you mean Lisbon? How could he accept such a lower payroll, then?"
"true statement, but im pretty sure he is able to find another club in China"
"It seems that Gaitán was for 18m€, and Carrasco (according to previous reports) 30m. I don't know if there is any hidden bonus or something, because Carrasco's fee is fucking low."
"Mmm, I don't agree with this sentiment. I mean the talent is there, he just didn't see eye to eye with Simeone in the end. If the guy can learn to just do more with his final product, anyone who picks him up has a special player on their hands."
He actually had a good run too. 
What a fucking game that was though 
"Nah, as RM fan I was scaried about him before that match. He was a hell of a good sub player, had a huge impact in the last 30 minute of a match."
"Ill be honest, i saw his fifa career potential and assumed he was a big up and comer."
"Paulinho got a hefty pay rise, now he’s playing for Barca and going to be at the World Cup, it can work out"
pay rise = career plummets 
"Not really, staying at the club who pays you less and don't play you at all is how you ruin your career. Getting hefty salary and being a star player in a team is how you succeed you liked it or not. "
"Unless you’re name is Paulinho!

Only player to go to China and come back stronger.

The real GOAT of the beautiful game.

Apparently making lots of money is career ruining nowadays

"They brlievd china will rule the world.

Get on the winning side early"
"I can only remember Correa, Vitolo, Koke, and Saúl, and those last 2 play midfield from time to time too. Does indeed leave them a bit short."
"They tend to play with wide midfielders, similar to Barca, with Saul and Koke often playing there. They still have Correa and Griezmann who can play out there but for the most part they Simeone doesn't utilise wingers too much."
Pass me the pack of chips. 
"Hulk has been the biggest mercenary of them all. He could have played in any league in the world, but he chose the easier league with more money. "
Some people don't want the pressure or do the hard work to be at the top clubs. I'm sure Hulk doesn't mind less stress and a lot more money.
"Was this surprising to you? There's been serious talks of Carrasco being gone since before the new year.

He just didn't ever live up to his hype, and I'd much rather have Vitolo who's already scored two goals is far more industrious playing out on the wing instead."
You have a shady Chinese owner and you can't believe it?
16M for Gaitan and 30M for Carrasco
didn't he have a buy out clause for 100M?
$$$$
"Well, Torres can not go to a bigger club than Atleti atm

"
"Not sure about Gaitan, i can see him coming back to us tho."
¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥
"Roberto Martinez is our manager. You know, the guy who prefers Witsel over Dembele and Nainggolan. It would absolutely not surprise me if he starts Carrasco over Hazard or De Bruyne smh"
"Why would it? The World Cup is in a couple of months, by that time Carrasco surely won't have forgotten how to play football"
spits hot fire
You cant really blame him here. The money he'll get will make his grandchildren live comfortably for the forseeing future.
"> Gyan who tossed his career for money.

You mean when he joined Sunderland for money?"
China transfer window is still open. 
"After tax I am assuming?

That isn't a lot of money at all relative to what a player of his caliber can get in Europe"
"He'll be back in Europe by 28-29 at the latest. I don't understand why people are so offended by these guy's decisions. They have such short careers, it would be stupid to say no."
"I would still say no to moving to China, thank you. "
"if he performs in china, he can do a paulinho. if he doesn't, 10 million a year doesn't sound bad"
"He's not good enough for Atletico, not that he doesn't have talent but his attitude is really poor. And if Simeone and Burgos of all people can't fix that then who can?

I honestly think the teams that have been rumoured to be interested in him(Bayern, Arsenal, Juve, Chelsea) have dodged a bullet. 

"
He is shit and only rated by fifa players
"Gaitan barely plays for Atlético, no surprises here"
I thought Carrasco was a big upcoming star. Why did they sell him?
"Actually for me thats the opposite, i can understand an argentinian but i thought Carrasco would have a lot of european clubs chasing after him, wasnt he really good not too long ago?"
"You expected Carrasco?

Carrasco leaving to China is causing me to go wtf man."
Carrashco
"Gaitan has been so, so bad for Atlético. We tried desperately to flog him in january but not even Watford or Crystal Palace were willing to buy him. This bid came out of nowhere but it was a very needed sale for the club"
"[Carrasco will win €10m per year. A lot, but not that impressive. ](https://as.com/futbol/2018/02/22/primera/1519328345_473425.html) "
seasons*
GAZUMP
"Torres is not going to leave if there's a chance of winning a trophy with Atleti. Is his childhood dream, and his only unfulfilled wish as a player. If we win something this year, he'll happily move to USA or China or even retire . If we don't.. he'll probably have to do it anyway."
Name change probably incoming. Wanda sold their shares a few days ago
It's okay I have absolutely no hopes anymore so no bad surprises
"For all the 'lol Martinez' memes here on reddit, he's actually done a great job so far. Literally the only two things you can fault him for are not calling up Naingollan and playing Mirallas as the occasional substitute. We are playing much more attractive football and there's a clear tactical plan (one that could backfire though). Obviously the team hasn't been tested yet but he hasn't embarrassed himself either. And it's not like we could've gotten a better manager anyway. "
At least he's an actual manager unlike Wilmots
😂😂😄
Lol
Why? Is there some sort of conspiracy behind this?
Pls
Carrasco would've been counting bags of money in the PL as well tbh
than*
He actually supports barca.
Could  you imagine him at a big club like Atletico Madrid? Would be a huge step for him 
it still amazes me how the sentence you just said changed its meaning over last 6 months
Carrasco can actually control a ball. 
"Some people look at career achievements as success and don't think money is the be-all, end-all measurement especially when they're already making a ton of it. In fact I'd say most players think the former because there are only a handful of players who have gone to China for non-retirement purposes."
"Career is trophies and fame for footballers.

Also a lot of people would say moving to China for more money is not a good career move.  Many players fall out of the NT because of it.  I personally don't blame them.  Family is #1"
Holy shit this sub is painfully American 
what? none of them can replace him lol tf
Is griezmann staying next season too?
Griezmann is likely gone too...
I dont see anyone else here
"Wales destroyed J. Lukaku.

I still have nightmares. Every attack went through his wing."
Chinese surroundings are as dirty as Portuguese. Trust me
he kissed his girl right? 
I really think he is a good player in a different system. Would be unbelievable in an attacking setup 
"I take it he means Boca, like Tevez did."
We could have got significantly more than 30m selling to another European club. 
Didn’t he have a 100m release clause after the final?
"> because Carrasco's fee is fucking low.

It's the discounted price for your stadium sponsor and former minority shareholder, who is also the new owner of Dalian."
Yeah I think they could have easily gotten more for Carrasco from a PL club
"> If the guy can learn to just do more with his final product, anyone who picks him up has a special player on their hands.

I mean we can say this about Adama Traore and Deufoleu, idk if thats even a positive for me. "
Delet
"So what happened to other great players, Hulk, Teixiera, Oscar etc.? Everybody was against to Paulinho transfer at that time, it was a gamble."
"Carrasco will probably still play for the NT, Witsel still does."
"Apart from Paulinho, how many more succesful comebacks can you count?"
"Wasn't Paulinho considered to be a last resort?

I mean fair play to him for getting to Barcelona and getting some good games but he's not exactly a world beater is he.

Could be a better player now had he stayed in a top tier quality league."
Don't think there's many people outside of China that watch the Chinese league though. If he loses his spot in the Belgian national team he'll likely be forgotten about unless by some chance he gets the Paulinho treatment.
"They could go another team and still earn a lot money. It is indeed a career ruin, they will be forgotten if they do not return Europe again."
Yes ? 
"That's where Pellé is? I remember those couple of months at Southampton where he seemed to be scoring for fun, then it all went belly up "
¥¥¥¥¥
"Essentially we defend in a strict 4-4-2, but we don't play a traditional 4-4-2 with wingers. Most often, we will attack in a 4-3-3 shape, with one winger pushing up to form the three attackers (will now be Correa, Vitolo or Saúl), while the ""side midfielder"" on the other side tucks in to become a number 8 in a midfield three (Koke or Saúl for the most part)."
"Also, Atleti have Vitolo now"
Ok but what? 
"It's mad with Hulk, he could have had a huge career"
When hulk went to china he has like the 4th highest salary only on par with Mess Ronaldo and some other guy in China. He was smart.
"Was he not really good last season? I thought he had a good year, maybe I'm thinking of someone else "
"Ac Milan isn't based in China. There's a massive difference between being owned by a Chinese (consortium) and being a Chinese club in china. It's stupid for a young player already showing talent to go to a Chinese club, it's not stupid for them to go to a team in Europe owned by a Chinese person/group"
Why so low for carrasco? Did he have a buyout clause?
"Yeah and Tite started Paulinho over all other CMs and people called him an idiot too.

Just because you got to China doesn't mean you lose all your footballing ability."
"doesn't carrasco mostly start as a lwb for belgium? If he doesn't perform very well, I think he'll start j. lukaku ahead of him."
And they wouldn't be able to on the measly £100-200k a week that half the clubs in the Prem would pay him?
Or maybe they could actually have a job and earn the money by themselves.
His grandchildren would be able to live off the millions he would make from him playing in literally any top 5 European league 
You forgot he left for some middle eastern club in his prime? Could’ve gone to better clubs then as he was in demand. 
"90% of this sub would take that money and run away with it. Not to mention that if youre rich in china its a pretty good life.

Edit:if youre rich anywhere honestly."
Its not like theyre going to be on the breadline playing anywhere else though is it?
"I don't think anyone is 'offended', are they? Just somewhat surprised.

I agree there is plenty of logic to taking the money, money is great. However there are also plenty of reasons to stay in Europe. Even in Europe you're still going to be making more than enough money to be set for life with reasonable investments. Add to that playing on a much more globally prestigious stage, and the culture shock of moving to China has proven to be tough for many players recently.

Besides, he is 'only' reported to be earning €10 million a year. We've seen many players reported to be earning a lot more than that in China, and he could earn a wage pretty close to that in Europe."
by then he won't be good enough to play for top tier clubs. he is abandoning his career.
"Yeah, I mean..  this is their job.  I bet most of us would accept an insane raise to work elsewhere for a couple years.

It makes even more sense when you remember that a player's career ends in their early or mid 30s. "
"I dont see many people offended, its more of a disaappintment feeling"
"you love money more than football if you do something like this that young.. it's so hard to understand why some people get offended?

e: I'm not judging his decision, maybe if I was him, I would've done the same. I'm just answering to 

> I don't understand why people are so offended by these guy's decisions. They have such short careers, it would be stupid to say no.

 As a football fan, I love football the way it is, to know that a footballer plays it more for money, it's not the same."
"It's not stupid to say no. Far more understandable if you are at the end of your career, but this is suicide for his development and possibility of actual achievement."
"It's a pretty long shot tbh. Of the people who went to China Paulinho is the only one who ended up at a better club. Many are still playing there and some like Tevez and Demba Ba have left for smaller clubs.  

His mentality doesn't seem right though seeing how Cholo gave up on him. Making money is great I agree. But it is disappointing that he's leaving  Europe and essentially giving up on playing at the top level."
"Paulinho would not have made it to Barca if not for his performaces with the Brazilian team. For comparison, Carrasco hasn't been so hot when playing for Belgium."
He didn't look motivated with Atletico in games that mattered. I can't imagine he'll decide he loves the game again despite 10 million a year.
Paulinho is a lonely fish in a big ocean. Most players never come back to a top 10 CL team.
Paulinho has drastically altered how I look at transfers to China
"Don't blame him going to make money at his stage in his career but its not like he had no other options. There was still quite a lot of interest in him, with reported offers from a few Premier League teams and Benfica.

"
You called?
"bad attitude, got into a bunch of spats with simeone coaching staff and other players, hasnt improved much if at all, selfish and some of the worst decision making in europes top 5 leagues, inconsistent af"
"Simeone doesn't like him anymore. It's sad cos a couple of seasons ago he could've got a transfer to any side in Europe, he was that good."
"He's a really frustrating player to watch. He's obviously very technically talented and is really fast, but his selfishness holds him back so much. Like he's good enough to beat one or two defenders, but then instead of dishing the ball he tries to beat the third and fourth, and gets dispossessed. This happens literally all the time and it's annoying af. Honestly I'm glad to see him go "
Yeah. Carrasco is only 24. Weird to see him go to China so early in his career.
Cacashco you mean?
[deleted]
"Fuck it breaks my heart thinking about his tears after Milan. I really hope we can win him a trophy this season. I still feel like he can offer something against top teams for his experience and work rate, but now that we're in the EL there's not that many games where we aren't the favourite, so the teams playstyle won't really suit him"
can I pick the name of the stadium please ? i asked first
Waiting decades upon decades for a golden generation and then let Marc Wilmots and Roberto Martinez manage them. What the fuck.
"I'm preparing the ""I expect nothing and I'm still let down."" meme folder for the WC"
If vince is fit we don't really need a manager tbh
😂😂😂
"I haven’t seen much of Belgium since Martinez took over, but I’ve always loved his style of football. He was one of the few managers in the premier league 4-5 years ago attempting a three at the back, and it really made watching his team attack a joy to watch. It’s just a shame that his teams often struggled at the back as they were made to play it out, even when they didn’t necessarily have the quality to do this. Although, this may be a lot more entertaining as a neutral, as I didn’t have the butt-clenching fear of seeing Gary Caldwell try to play it out from the back."
"I really would love to be as optimistic and see any progress but I swear I watched every minutes and I still fail to see any tactical plan, either offensively or defensively... As we did against Conte's Italy in the Euro, I predict we'll be outplayed by any team that has either a decent stack of players, or a decent tactic (or both). But if you see any please tell me coz its depressing"
Typically being a club manager is a harder task than a national team manager. Martinez could be an average club manager and still be an above average national manager. 
"Oh, it's just my bet. We'll see"
"Ooooook, I saw a spanish journalist saying it. 

https://twitter.com/jrlawrance/status/967906000610217985

He's not used to say things if at least has a little clue. But has been too quiet... so I just made my bet on him. So let's wait and see.

The guy it's not the usual Manolete. I do prefer to say it as a bet than giving the guy what he doesn't want, bad publicity (if he is wrong) because he is not looking for the easy tweet imo."
Yeah but not nearly the numbers the Chinese are offering.
Too bad he can’t do anything with it.
[deleted]
"It looks like we are getting rid of expensive salaries for some reason.
Gaitán, Vietto and Carrasco contracts added up to 13 Million per year (rumours, not publicly disclosed). I wouldn't be surprised if this is used to offer Antoine some kind of contract extension. "
*unsheathes nunchucks from waist holster*
You mean Spain? Surroundings?
ye
And he liked it. 
It‘s because they want to avoid the extra tax. Wanda (your stadium sponsor) bought Dalian Yifang in 2015. so you probably get more money through stadium sponsor payment
"Yes, but it was a negotiated transfer, so the release clause doesn't matter"
But what PL club was going to buy him? Maybe they'd have got that money from a team like Leicester but would he move there for £100k a week?
"> I mean we can say this about Adama Traore and Deufoleu, idk if thats even a positive for me. 

Yes you could. It doesn't have to be a positive for you, many clubs would see that as investment not worth taking as it would take too many resources and time to teach. Having said that it's been done before, and if it can be done with Carrasco all I was saying is he is a very good player."
"> I mean we can say this about Adama Traore and Deufoleu, idk if thats even a positive for me.

The main difference is those players would be nowhere near the pitch during a CL Final.

The underrating of Carrasco going on in this thread is crazy, he's much better than Traore (who is still inconsistent AF in the championship) and Deulofeu"
Sterling?
"Those two have different problems, they struggle with their feet and composure. They lose the ball too much to play for a top team. Don't think Carrasco has that issue."
Hulk went from Zenit to Shangai it's not like he left Barca or something and plus his career started in Asia and before Porto he played in Tokyo Verdy. Teixiera left Shakhtar for much larger money and Oscar clearly left for money not to expect to play for national team or to get famous.
Hulk took the money instead of a great career when he left Porto to join Zenit. At that moment he was so good he could have been a starter to any team he wanted.
"No gamble, the way he was playing with Brazil it was safe to expect him to continue at a top level with Barca "
"A bit of a stretch to call Hulk and Teixeira great players. Oscar is indeed massively talented I agree, he's definitely at least on a similar level as Willian/Pedro"
"Footballers don't play football to stay in the center of attention, some players take football as their job. And doubt someone would pay as much as Asian clubs for these types of players. "
"lmao

Securing the bag is **Never** a bad look you fucking weirdo"
Forgot about him yeah they're pretty much fine in that respect.
"I'd say irregular. Some great games, some bad games. At times it looked like he would become a star, but he never really took of, and was not really progressing as expected."
"Every player in Spain has a release clause. I think Carrasco's clause was €100 million, but release clauses doesn't matter if the clubs agree to a fee. It is likely that low because there's a 100% tax on buying foreign players to China now, so for the Chinese club Carrasco actually costs €60 million. "
"Fair point, it's just that for example Witsel is still a starter even though he is very mediocre at best for the national team. There are some good or even great players in the Chinese league, but loads of them are there for just the money and are not at the same level as players in the bigger leagues."
"He does, and even though I do like Carrasco as a player I hope J.Lukaku starts over him. I think Carrasco is probably a bit wasted at lwb, should be better as a substitute for when Hazard or Mertens gets tired."
Poor lad
"90 percent of the subs alternate option isn't playing for millions for one of the best teams in the world. 

Carrasco can easily get 7-8 mil a year in Europe if he wants it. The guys that go to China usually get 3-4 times what they'd get in Europe."
"People always say this but it's not true at all. If 90% of the people here would have the option of making Millions at a great team VS. making more Millions at a Chinese Team, most would go with the former.

Money stops having worth and after you have so much anyways"
Yeah no shit if the choice is between 50k or 10m per year. Not when the choice is between 5m or 10m a year
"I honestly disagree with the idea that it's a good life in China, regardless of your wages. Having lived there, I can honestly say that if I had the opportunity to make as much money as he could in Europe, I would most definitely not take the job in China. It's the accessibility factor (or lack thereof). The players who make these moves clearly have no clue just how shitty and difficult it is living there. Furthermore, I can tell you from first hand experience that Dalian is no Shanghai or Beijing, or even Guangzhou or Nanjing. It's a pretty shit city. I don't understand this move for a second. "
"90%? More like 99,9%"
Being rich in Madrid wouldn't be too terrible. 
"I wouldn’t take the cash if I was an immensely talented footballer and I’m not just talking shit. 

Yanick could make close to that in Europe and not play in a farmers league. What is he giving up for that extra cash?

Honesty I genuinely believe the “happiness” return of that extra cash is nothing compared to winning a league in Europe or CL football.


"
"get paid a ridiculous amount, you're the best player on the pitch, don't need to try that hard. Pretty sweet gig if you ask me"
"He was earning 31k in Atletico, apparently. The contrast between the wages is enormous."
"If you had a chance to secure the futures of multiple generations in your family, you would take it. The same can't be said most players playing in European leagues. "
"I think about it like this: if you could double or triple your current salary by working in China, would you?"
"That's it, indeed, surprised.

And also, I just don't understand. Yes, it will make him incredibly rich. But it isn't a smart decision when you're talking about football and his talent. He's going to a newly promoted club in a mediocre competition, 8000 km from here. Away from friends and family, living in a golden cage.

And is there really anybody who believe he's doing this because ""Le projet sportif m'a convaincu.""..."
"It's not our business. The man does what ever he wants. If a company wants to triple or quadruple my salary, ciao bye, I'm out. "
He is still playing football isn't he. If someone gave you a 10 time raise to go do the same job in China wouldn't you go
Any player could suffer a career ending injury tomorrow. Many of them don't have a skill other than playing football - is it hard to believe that some would prioritise making money to set them and their family up for life?
"Seydou Keita managed to play for Roma and Valencia (not Barça but still pretty good) after coming back from China and he was much older - but you're right, not really the norm."
"Tevez came to Boca straight from Juventus, then he left for China."
"I mean would you have said Paulinho had a great attitude when he left Spurs?

If Carassco really tries and doesn't phone it in (like what Tevez did), then he'll succeed."
"Boca Juniors the small club, sure"
Tévez and demba ba went there when they were older. Not comparable to this case.
"Boca small club, I LMAO"
Everyone who has left has been way late in their career.  Only Witsel and Oscar are guys i can relate to this move.
">Paulinho is the only one who ended up at a better club. 

Because Paulinho is also one of the few that went to China while being relatively young. Paulinho is honestly a better comparison to Carrasco than someone like Tevez, who was much older and obviously past his prime with no ambition of returning to top level."
"This is ignorant about Tevez. Earned a fortune and likes being at Boca, so he went home."
">smaller clubs 

>Boca Juniors 

You sound so ignorant. He left from Juventus where he was a core player that helped them to a CL final and came straight to Boca. Stop."
">Boca smaller

X Doubt"
Rumours of him coming to us were false 100% we have way too many  good wingers to bring him in
"Meh he came from Benfica, his best bet was a move to one of the top 3 leagues or China, tbh if I was a half decent footballer I'd go to China not just for the money but culture too."
There was no chance of him coming to Benfica we couldnt even afford to bring in a half decent right back there was no way we were going to spend a dime on a winger when we already have 5 natural wingers and 7 players who can play on the wings if we need them to. Benfica has also shifted away from buying old players after the departure of Jorge Jesus. 
"Neither you guys or Crystal Palace were willing to cough up 18million euros for him in january. Which says it all really, since paying that isn't a big issue for any PL club with more than 1 season of that sweet TV earnings under their belt"
"The old Oscar move, that is. About to hit your prime but decide to sell out for a quick dollar."
It's a large wad of dough to be sure 
Nuho24 Metropolitano
Our FA is shit. :(
Dont speak ill of the dead
Who would you appoint?
That's because the whole nation will have us bading in hope again. We must hold on to our bitterness and not be fooled again! Stay strong!
Atleast you made it to the WC. Be grateful.
The England special 
He does well in cups.. took Wigan to an FA cup win.
We're talking 200k a week. Not that unattainable for someone of Carrasco's calibre.
he plays wide midfielder lol not striker 
( ͡°ω ͡°)
The guy I replied to is Portuguese 
my man 
I know but I was just saying because of the hype after the CL final. 
Lots of movement could happen in the summer opening up a spot for Carrasco. I said PL club cause they are the richest but there obviously other European clubs that can pay a lot for him
"i was at no point comparing him to those two. i was remarking on the comment about no final product - people on here always act like thats not a big deal and that a player is so close to world class if they can just ""get that final product"", and my argument is no, that isnt the case, there are very few players who have absolutely zero end product that are able to actually flip that around. a few do, most cannot. that was not a direct comparison though, surely i recognize that AM > Boro "
"I just don't understand Teixeira, had the chance to go to Liverpool, went to China, then had the chance to go to Inter, didnt want that either and is now back in Brazil? What the fuck"
Yeah there wasn't a team in the world that could afford Hulk at that time that didn't want him
"But most footballers also like to win on the biggest stage and play for their national team. It's a combination of their job and the love of the game and winning. Going to China *generally* kills any hope of winning big prizes. Good players in Europe get paid extremely well and still get the challenge of playing against the best competition in their profession. 

Edit: there's more to life/work than just a big payday."
You can't even see the difference between money and career you fucking cunt. Idiot prick.
"I had Gaitan pegged as a major talent, shame it didn't work out for him at Atleti. Was always gonna struggle with a guy like Simeone who demands so much from his wide players."
I think you're overrating Carrasco a little bit. What European team is paying him that?
"**If** what i was looking at was right, apparently he was *only* on around 2 million euros a year. So hes increasing his salary fivefold. "
"> Money stops having worth and after you have so much anyways

Everyone seems to think so, besides the people who actually have that much money. Footballers in most cases aren't on the same level as the greedy politician/corporate whores, but still."
"> Money stops having worth and after you have so much anyways

to you"
"most of them dont have a real job for the majority of their lives afterwards anyways, so these millions indeed do matter"
"I dont think so tbh. He is not likely to join a title winning team in which he takes a huge role in the team. In China he can make more bankfor 2-3 years and then try to make a move to Europe in his prime, if he wants so."
"I don't agree. If China is a paradise to live into, I would agree. But China imo doesn't offer any life quality whatsoever, that would convince me to join a team there. Even so that they already win lots of money in their current teams! This could also take out his chances of going to WC with Belgium, so there's that"
"From my experience, the more money someone has the more greedy they become. That doesn't apply to everyone of course, but the majority I would say"
Youre part of the 10% mate.
Lol you are clearly not a millionaire.
"Maybe at Bill Gates rich, sure. Which these guys won't ever get too. "
"Yeah right. Very few footballers actually go to China, and some like Rooney even chose to stay in England when they are past their prime and they could earn more elsewhere. "
True but apparently his wage at Atletico was £1.7mill a year and new wage is roughly £9mill a year. So its more than 5 times his wage
[deleted]
"> I don't understand this move for a second

10 million a year. In money. His paycheck has so many zeros it says ""oooooh""."
"Hell, for 10M a year I would even live in Manchester"
"He is a footballer, footballer lives as emperor in China"
"Did you live there making 10m a year?

People on that type of money won't live near the same lifestyle you lived, even if you were out there making 300k a year. 

"
"While that argument is true in theory, I doubt that's the reason most of these players move. Professional athletes are horrible with money. I think I read a study somewhere that said that a lot of them are broke by the time they're 5-10 years into their retirement. "
"I don't give a shit about grandchildren I haven't even had yet, let alone great grandchildren. Not only that, but I wouldn't want them growing up spoiled brats anyway!

On top of that, if I was playing for atheltico you better believe I'm gonna be rich for the rest of my life already without needing a move to China. It's pure greed."
Earning even 1 million per year isnt going to secure the financial future of your family? My kids are screwed with my 25k a year wage then.
"Yeah, but with all due respect, i doubt youre already earning more money than you know what to do with?"
"you're right but he was already earning way more than an average footballer/person at Atletico, it's not like he wasn't already set for life. But overall, you're right, I tried to explain that guy why it's so hard to him to understand this 'hate'. Us, football fans, usually love football, if a player plays it just for money.. it's not the same, at least for me."
"I'm not trying to hate or whatever, but it's not like he was on 1,000€ a month.. He and his family should be set for life by his wages for 6 months. He was playing for a top club, making shit tons of money but he chose to go for money in a way less competitive league. "
"These guys are making millions already. The won't be on the streets if their career ends tomorrow. Worst case, any pro player would be able to find some kind of youth coaching job. "
If you can't be motivated by Diego Simeone and German Burgos then I think you're a lost cause
... yes compared to European teams 
"Good thing I didn't say 'small' club then.  

My point is that players who stepped up after going to China are very rare.  "
Are you serious? Gaitan would battle Jonas for best player in the squad
"I was merely making the point he still has the ability to play at the top level if he wanted as he did have offers from teams playing in the premier league last month, but he chose China. 



"
"I have some business in Dalian, not exactly super nice or full of culture TBH. "
"Yeah, have you ever had a Chinese pancake? I'd be eating them shits breakfast second breakfast elevenses lunch luncheon afternoon tea dinner and supper"
Oscar was older and stagnating; Carasco could have become a world beater
"you know what i like that 

provided i get free first class tickets plus locker room access every home match "
Just so you know you will get a lot of support from the Netherlands. More pressure and bad karma this time!
At least we do better than the Dutch..
Pretty sure that Dave Whelan's broken leg powering them to the trophy or so the commentary would have me believe
Apparently they offered so much he's willing to go to a way worse league :)
"That last year at Shaktar he was so good. 22 goals in 15 apps in league, brace against Madrid in group stage, tons of teams interested. Can't blame him to get $$ though but still.  

""The saddest thing in life is wasted talent"""
"Yeah Teixeira is kinda hard to understand, maybe he likes money or hates Liverpool/Inter. Who knows. "
"If my memory serves me correctly, it was during the time of the Ukrainian insurgency and he was desperate to leave Ukraine.

Shakhtar was asking for way too much than we're willing to pay so it left him with little options."
"Wait, since when is Teixeira back in Brazil?"
"[Teixeira wanted to go to Liverpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g-ToleDkrg), it was his club president that fucked him because he kept raising the price."
"The Liverpool move fell through b/c Shakhtar increased their asking price at the very last minute and we refused to match it.

Was not a decision made by Teixeira."
Can't believe he turned down the chance to win nothing and earn less money to go and play in China
"For some people money is money, and that's why they play, not passion. It's a complicated scenario for a lot of kids coming from really poor places. Football is accessible - it doesn't take a lot of money to play in most places. Kids get good then see the opportunity to make money playing football as something that is more possible than going to school and starting a career. That seems almost impossible to kids from extreme poverty. Idk about Teixeira's upbringing, he may not fall into that category, but I know it's a trend that is mirrored in the US with inner-city kids and football/basketball. Not all of them love the sport, they just do it because it seems more likely than going to school. "
"Saed Kolasinac makes 120 thousand pounds a week. 

Carrasco checks all the boxes that make teams pay money

1) young 
2) Champions league experience
3) starter on a good world cup team coming off a world cup year "
Somebody like Everton could pay him that if we count a sign on fee

they could easily invest their money and live a pretty good life just from dividends
The thing is you can have both! Be a legend in Europe when you're 30 semiretire in China and get paid shitloads to occasionally show some effort.
"Having been on this board for so long, but it always surprises me that people can say things like what you quoted. My guess is that most people on this board simply never faced the reality of being poor or in dire straits.

The difference between 5m and 10m is enormous, ffs it's 5,000,000 more. 7m to 10m is still a massive difference. That's 3,000,000. When you account for interest and proper investing, that extra 3m will make a gigantic difference in retirement and whatnot.

Then you take into account other things such as the possibility of career ending injuries, football being such a short career, the ability to be less intense about your job in a much easier league (think of it as you moving to a much easier job in the same field but getting paid double, fuck yeah I would take that offer).

Other factors include: you may be able to live off easily on 80k but these players normally have a much higher expenses so that the extra 3m to them would be like you having 300k extra. Relatively speaking, to them the extra 3m is really not that much. Sure there are exceptions but the majority of them I take have high expenses that need high income to pay for now and into the future. This then once again brings into question that their careers are short and any injuries can derail them for years. Normal folks meanwhile work well into their late 60s. Not all footballers will end up as coaches or analysts.

So their 10 year career has to more or less cover them well into retirement. Who could blame them for taking the money? I am more impressed by the players that decide to stay in the face of a larger than 50% pay increase."
"If your making like 4 mill per year and play at that level for like 6 more years, that would still be like 24 mill... Not to mention he'd probably make more over time and the better he plays, plus money from endorsements and sponsors, plus the money he's already made.....

You're telling me player wouldn't be able to live a lavish life after they retire with that kind of money?"
"I take my hat to Rooney and Casillas, because they chose the best option for their families and weren't greedy bastards. And they were not 24!"
That's low but I think he could realistically get a 100k a week deal in Europe
"Rooney didn't and Tevez didn't stay.

The situation is different depending on your ambitions and what you are already earning."
"Well that's just not true. If your current job/city is nicer and more comfortable plus you're already happy with the salary, why would you have to jump.. I would agree that most probably would take it but not everyone. "
"No I didn't, but as has been mentioned elsewhere in this these comments, he could get 7 or 8 and play for a top European club and all while living a much better quality of life. If that's what it's coming down to, for me it's an easy decision. "
That's true. I believe it's something around 50% of former NFL players end up being bankrupt. It must be tough going from earning $5m/year to earning $50k once you retire. 
"So I'm not talking about you or you self-absorbed reality. I'm just saying a footballer's career is still just that, a career. You might as well earn as much money as possible to ensure your future and your loved ones' futures.

If I were to offer you a similar job to your current one with less stressful hours and 10 times the pay, I wouldn't call you greedy for taking it. I'd call you smart.

I can't believe people on this sub are so adamant with this simplistic view."
"Mate, I really sometimes dislike players going to big money teams, but look at that! 10 million a year make it really hard not to take that offer even though you are already earning 1m/yr"
"I wasn't talking about current generations. $1m/year can support future generations, if invested and managed properly. But seeing as the average athlete doesn't manage money well, that money probably won't see future generations (grandchildren, great-grandchildren etc). It'd be incredibly hard to burn a salary of $10m/year enough so that future offspring don't see a dime of it let alone enjoy it.

"
"Taxes are a thing even though it seems like some players try to avoid them. There are also other agent fees etc.

Also players are probably accustomed to lavish lifestyle, so they burn money like there's no tomorrow. 

And what if you get permanently injured? Don't know how things work then. Maybe the club pays for the end of the contract, maybe not. Probably have some kind of insurances also, but not for that kind of money."
"In terms of wealth yes. In terms of what we stand for, no. "
"Sorry, the Spurs can’t light a candle to what Boca is history wise. Come back whenever you beat Real Madrid or Milan in a final game."
"He came from Boca and returned there. So he ended up in the same place, not worse or better off."
"Let's be real, Boca Juniors are a bigger club than Tottenham. Probably bigger than Atlético too tbh"
"European teams? How many of them have won 18 international trophies like Boca?

Get off your high horse. "
Ridiculous coming from a Tottenham supporter. What have they done compared to Boca? 
"You did say smaller club though. Boca is one of the biggest 20 clubs in the world, in my opinion. Maybe not quality wise, but playing for Boca is a dream for millions."
"on the other hand I don't think getting another winger would be that good of investment when we have Zivkovic, Cervi, Rafa and Salvio already, only way i would see it done would be if Salvio getting sold, otherwise that's too many players"
I disagree
"“Battle Jonas for best player in squad”. 

Woof, no wonder Portuguese football is at a much lower level now than recent years. Y’all sold everybody in the country with two boots on their feet. 

Guess sporting will have to open up a second academy to restock everyone’s squads."
"Yeah I know you have a decent point however he is 30 and probably thinking of the retirement fund, it's not like he's world class so won't be fighting for UCL/League titles."
"Not really, no club made an acceptable bid for Gaitain in january. We were desperate to get rid of him and he was basically offered to anyone prepared to pay 18M euros, which is a discount in todays market"
3rmb too lol insane
Okay Tevez
"Ummmm, no. Oscar was 24 when he made the move to China, same as Carrasco now."
"Oscar was a year older, but we're talking 24/25 years old. In a footballer's career, that's not really much difference at all - both were entering the prime of their careers and decided to take the money."
"Must be a Sunderland fan then, that's the only plausible explanation."
"I mean, i just read here that he actually got kicked from Jiangsu, Capello wants to reform the squad and wants him out, like, what you doing mate?"
"Brazilian press says that everything is done, Jiangsu just delayed the paperworks for whatever reason."
"I get it bud, but he passed 2 years in China and got kicked because Capello wants to reform the squad and he is now negotiating to come back to Brazil, was it worth it?"
"For players coming on a free transfer, wages are usually a bit higher. I just don't think Carrasco is that good, honestly. "
"Premier League teams pay massively inflated wages because every sleasy agent around knows that they're made of money. 
There are so many average and even poor players in England that are on astonishingly high wages relative to their ability"
Those things usually factor more into the transfer fee than wages.
"Lets say he earns 4m in Europe and 8m in China.

The law of diminishing utility simply explains that the benefit from receiving the first 4m (European wage) is bigger than the benefit from the next 4m (additional wage in China).

In fact, if the utility from the additional 4m is bigger than the cost of his transfer (moving to China, different life standard, playing in a less competitive league, etc.) he should leave Atleti."
"That's assuming the Chinese league is still spending silly money when the later reaches 30, which may not be the case."
Maybe. Depends who was willing to buy him. Haven't seen him play so don't really know how good he is but they've sold him for €30million which isnt a lot for a youngish winger from a top european team in the current market.
I seriously doubt if he would make that much. Many PL players of similar caliber are on around 100k a week or 5m a year. Plus higher tax rate and cost of living in England than in China
"If my current job was already paying me like twenty times the average wage then no, I'm not giving up my passion and lifestyle just to get more money. There's only so much money you can spend you know?"
"Dude don't even try with these dudes, this sub is filled with Euros/Americans who haven't ever watched South American football."
"Serious question though, if you put Boca Juniors in the Premier League or La Liga, where do you think they would stand? Would they be mid-table or fighting relegation?"
"Please enlighten me, what is it you stand for?"
I never said Spurs were one of the huge clubs. But I’m sure you know nothing of Tottenham’s history anyways so I’m not going to argue with you about it 
"Again, didn’t say we were a big club either. "
"Bro playing for any club is a dream for millions. In truest sense of the word, they are not a ""big"" club compared to the rest of the world. Certainly not top 20. "
"> You did say smaller club though. Boca is one of the biggest 20 clubs in the world, in my opinion.

In terms of fanbase? I'd be really surprised if that was the case."
"Ok, but you guys did watch Gaitan here, didn't you? He could easily play in midfield in a 433.
Regardless, even as a winger, he offers way more than than any of the other guys, Cervi coming the closest, right now."
"Without going into detail, having Gaitan in our team right now would make us favourites for the title"
He was 25 when he moved.
">to come back to Brazil

With a lot of money. That was the whole point - He might have just played football to make money. Maybe he doesn't care about going all over, though an interview someone posted seemed to suggest otherwise. People act like he's going to die with so much regret for not moving to x or y but maybe he doesn't care. Maybe he's perfectly content being in Brazil. Who knows. I just think assuming he's some moron who is going to live in regret is a bit unfair. "
"the same here in China, average players got massive salary"
"There are many mediocre players in the PL making insane amounts of money. Rooney, Benteke, Deeney, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Drinkwater, Xhaka... The list goes on. Carrasco, as much as I hate his selfish mentality, is more talented than any of those players
"
"Implying as if playing in another country that has a less developed football culture means there's less passion. 

And you aren't giving up your lifestyle. You're moving to a fun, culturally rich place with an essentially infinite amount of money. Life is about perspective. Bashing these guys for living out their dreams and being paid well in the process is short-sighted."
"Nah its worth trying, education is the first step. "
"Right now, 12-8? We actually have a fairly strong side on all accounts by argentine standards this year, especially if our four injured starters (all among our best players) were magically better. Our style would fit the prem very well actually. But tbh this varies year by year cause players get bought in droves. Of course prem £££ would solve that problem."
"A club rich in history and titles in an equally rich country in terms of what it gave to the football world. A club that gave players like Juan Román Riquelme or Diego Maradona to the world. A club with one of the most emblematic and fervent fanbases on the entire world. A club who gave birth along with River Plate to the fiercest rivalry in the football world.

For you to ask that question, you have to be either absurdly ignorant about football culture or absurdly arrogant by believing that anything relating football outside Europe doesn't matter. "
"Up until recently we had the most international trophies ever. So theres that. Our stadium is almost always named as one of the hardest away games, if not the hardest, in the world, regardless of our quality as a team. We produced Maradona and Tevez, to name a couple of players who you might have heard of. In fact in some of our most recent competitve matches in Europe, which were admittedly a while back, we beat Real Madrid and Milan. I mean christ, how can you people trash Man City and PSG for ""bringing money into the game"" when you have been doing that to the rest of the world for the last twenty years. Also hilarious to mock Boca when you don't even have a flair."
"Boca is one of the most historic clubs in the world... With one of the biggest fanbases, one of the most iconic stadiums, won 6 Libertadores reaching the final 10 times, 3 Intercontinental Cups. In terms of international trophies won it's only behind Real Madrid and Milan according to FIFA, like another user said."
flair up or shut up
"Drugs, sexism and violence "
">... yes compared to European teams 

Is Tottenham not a European club? Or has your team been relocated?"
"Yeah I'm sure millions want to play fro my hometown club, Comunicaciones in Guatemala. Boca Juniors is the biggest club in Latin America, imo. The quality isn't there, I completely agree, but in terms of stature, they are comparable to Celtic or Rangers in my eyes. "
"Are you kidding? It's one of the most historical clubs in the world. Clubs like Chelsea, PSG etc aren't big just because they've had money in the last couple of years... Big clubs are the historical ones, Ajax, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Milan. Boca has one of the biggest fanbases in the world too. I'd say the club with the third most international competitions won in the history of the game is certainly in the ""top 20""."
"According to Wikipedia, 40% of Argentina follows Boca. That's close to 20 million people already. I'm sure there are supporters all across Latin America as well. 

In terms of trophies, Boca has 22 international trophies recognized by FIFA, behind only Madrid and Milan. "
"Wowww I highly disagree, Cervi is on the form of his life right now and I don't really mind Rafa too much, not to mention Zivkovic is a boss on the midfield, getting Gaitan an expensive player with an expensive wage just to play right midfield wouldn't make us title favourites. If I was going to go high up and waste so much money and wages on a player i'd rather get Hradecky"
I'll always love Gaitan but to be completely honest I'd rather keep playing Cervi atm.
"More serious candidates? Sure.
Favourites? Just no. We lost to Liverpool pretty heavily, but we still the best team in the league."
"Less passion on my part. If I'm playing for Liverpool, or any club for a few years, you can bet I'm staying loyal to them unless something amazing comes up (bigger club, bigger role, childhood dream club etc.).

Of course you're giving up your lifestyle. Why would I move from the place all my friends are, I speak the language, I already have essentially infinite money, just to go somewhere I don't speak the language, have no friends, and slightly more infinite money???"
Go on then. 
This guy gets it.
"> players like Juan Román Riquelme or Diego Maradona

came from Argentinos Jrs, didn't they?"
The disrespect for South American teams in this sub is unreal.
"Maradona came out of Argentinos Jrs actually. Not to say that Boca hasn't produced some of the best talents in the world, like Riquelme, Rattín, etc.

Edit: Riquelme also came out of Argentinos. My bad."
Did you confuse the club with Maradona?
"I like how you reduced more than 100 years from one of the biggest clubs in history that gave so much to the football world to only their lowest points. We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behaviour, or so the saying goes. The racism is so palpable I can almost touch it."
"this made me lol, you cheeky cunt"
Brexit means Brexit 
"Ill have you know Walter Bou could outscore Ronaldo if he wanted to, and Frank Fabra is just a colombian Phillip Lahm. No quality, plis ;)"
"I would agree, but rangers and celtic aren't big clubs either.

Celtic MAYBE, but that's a different discussion "
"Nah i'd disagree with that. They're big historically, sure. They're not big in the modern sense of the game.

What a big club is, is all relative. Look at it this way; when an up and coming player wants to move to ""big"" club, do you think Boca Juniors is in his mind? It depends where he's coming from, but the general consensus would be no (in my opinion). They would be looking for a move to a big club like Chelsea, RM, Barcelona, either of the Manchester teams, etc. Because they are big clubs in terms of spending, quality, and ambitions.

I'm sorry to hurt your feelings, but Boca is not a big club these days. Not when you're looking at the bigger picture."
Boca has fans all over the world. I'm from Europe. There's also a nice following in Japan for example. Boca es Mundial is the saying after all.
"I feel like people need to bring up contacts with International trophies. This isn't me trying to make the South American League look any worse or any better than any League at all, but I feel like it's disingenuous to just say International trophies without saying much else. Some random team from New Zealand could have a bunch of international trophies just because they're playing against Southeast Asian Clubs. 

Im probably just beong whiny"
Cholismo killed Gaitan. He is a shell of the player he was a few years ago. So incredibly timid and nervous on the pitch
"In a world where money pretty much dictates your results yes, Boca is not as big, but that’s pretty much the only metric in which Boca is beaten by European teams.

6 Libertadores, 3 Intercontinental cups (beating 70’s legendary M’Gladbach, 2000’s Figo’s Madrid and the star studded Milan in 2003) are a good metric to kind of gauge how big Boca is.

Hell, the last time Real Madrid lost an international final was against Boca in 2000.

Maradona, Cannigia, Riquelme, Tevez, Gago, Banega, Verón all played for Boca at some point. 

One of the biggest fanbases and the toughest derby there is (vs River Plate). Top all that with one of the most, if not, the famous stadium ever (consistently listed as the one you should visit before you die).

I think that’s a pretty good resume."
See above
"Riquelme came from Boca, Maradona came from Argentinos Jrs., although he rose to worldwide prominence with Boca, so they have a fair claim on shaping him to be the player he would eventually become.

EDIT: Riquelme also came from Argentinos Jrs. technically, but he only played in the inferior divisions and never disputed an official match for them. It's pretty much a technicality to me, I wouldn't exactly credit Atlético for the formation of Raúl for example."
"It's what happens when only a fraction of content is not from the top Europeans; the same can be said to Africa, Asia, N. America, Oceania and even the so-called ""lower tier leagues"" of Europe.

There's no point in trying to deny that most of pretty much everything in football eventually ends up in the top European leagues but being willingly ignorant toward everything else is outright stupid."
Riquelme also came out of Argentinos Jrs
"Yeah i was thinking developed as in grew to his best/near best as opposed to academy boy. But yeah, both us and riBer tend to pump out good talent. Also Newells recently for some reason."
"lol

Do you like anal? Because you sure took it up the ass.

It’s a joke man. Chill "
"Cute

You just can't admit you said something stupid because you started watching the sport in 2014. You're ignorant of the rest of the worlds teams because Americans are mostly Eurocentric due to TV coverage options. 

Don't be ignorant. "
By literally any metric that is no money Boca is bigger then most other clubs in the world. Including competitiveness: i wonder how many clubs would have an easy time playing us in the bombonera.
It is a dream of mine watching Boca in La Bombonera. Even better if its against River. 
"Mind on see ausalt öeldes pikka aega huvitanud ning teema on kohane. Kuidas sai eestlasest tulihingeline Boca fänn, kes räägib klubist sama hästi kui mõni kohalik?"
"They could, but they don't. South American clubs used to be on par with European clubs, with the gap widening exponentially over the last 20 or so years. "
Lmao. Copa Libertadores is probably the toughest tournament in the world. Boca has 6.
All you said is education is the first step though. I'm willing to be educated on your club and what you stand for that makes you believe it's bigger than European clubs. For what it's worth I don't feel that way myself but I want to know your point of view. 
"I agree. We all know that the European clubs have the most money and therefore get the best players, but to classify teams like Boca as ""small"" is ridiculous, imo."
"You're giving the average user on this subreddit far too much credit. Clubs like Boca, River Plate or Santos are entities on their own not just in South America, but also in the entire world. Anyone who dismisses them just like the user above did is already far too ignorant for their own good."
Yeah I realized after posting and forgot to edit. Will do now.
"So I was supposed to know it was a joke? I've seen plenty of people in this subreddit talking in those terms about south american football (or even worse, south americans themselves) and they've all been dead serious about it. I had no reason to believe otherwise before you told me it was a joke."
"Americans are Eurocentric because the European teams are far superior to the South American teams. Put Tottenham against Boca and Boca would get shit on. You guys need to chill out, Boca get trophies because the teams they play are League 1 level. "
"Dude, if Boca is a big club, then why don't you attract big name players? 

I wonder how much of an easy time they would have in the CL or away anywhere.

Cuz that's quite clearly what we're talking about here."
"I'm well aware of that and holds them in very high esteem, and I realized that my other comment really doesn't reflect that at all. Sorry for making it seem like I was talking shit"
Read my other comments. I was at no point slating it
"I meant farther up in the thread, but that wasnt clear so thats ok. I dont think we are bigger then all European clubs, but i think that historically we are up there with the top. Until recently we had the most international cups or any club, and even now I think only a couple of clubs are ahead of us. We are world famous for our incredibly passionate fans; going to la bombonera to play against Boca is considered one of the hardest away games in the world regardless of the actual level of our play. We have consistently produced world class players of the likes of riquelme, tevez, Maradona, etc. Our rivalry with River is pretty universally considered the biggest rivalry in the footballing world. Generally speaking we are historically a massive massive club. Today we might not have a huge impact internationally due to wealth disparity, but I dont think its wrong of me to consider Boca a massive club. "
">Americans are Eurocentric because the European teams are far superior to the South American teams. 

Lol outright admitting you're supporting **because of success**. Go support your local MLS team. Jesus. 

>Put Tottenham against Boca and Boca would get shit on. 

Enjoy being a Tottenham fan until Manchester City win the league this year. Your biggest accomplishment is finishing above Arsenal. "
">Why are you not competing for the CL season after season? 

Are you aware of where they are? "
"We would make the last 16 in the CL iif we had the money the CL gives for even 1 seasooon. Our team is actually ppretty good, and i would love to see teams like arsenal come to la bombonera, that would be hilarious. But the fact remains that we are not in Europe, we are in south america. And ask any other south american team if they like coming to la bombonera to play. Look Europe has money and that attracts players, but that does NOT make european clubs bigger then us. Unless you wanna go ahead and say that all the big clubs are chinese, since they seem to be taking players away from Europe, including good players like carrasco and teixeira. Very few clubs have the total package of history and talent and money that say, barca or RM have, but the only thing we are missing as a club is the money."
"You're not, I understand your point. It is important to take context into account when talking about international cups. "
"Ok that's fair enough, I don't think anyone would argue that Boca are not a massive club so it's certainly not wrong of you to think that.  I think people may have taken your comment as that you thought they were bigger than all European clubs , that's how I interpreted it at least, but now you've explained a bit more I understand where you're coming from. I wasn't trying to be disingenuous to Boca, just a mix up I guess. Thanks for explaining.  

I wish I could pay more attention to South American football but the exposure (like being aired on TV)  and time difference does make it challenging. "
If I supported teams because of success I wouldn’t have started supporting Tottenham lmfao. 
"yes that's why I edited it immediately, brain fart.

You can focus on my mistake that i fixed myself immediately or actually rebuttal, up to you. "
"> only thing we are missing as a club is the money.

And that's what i've been saying. I never put down Boca's achievements, records, fan base, or whatever. In my above posts i specifically said that what a ""big"" club is, is relative and that in this example we're looking at the money side of things. 

And Boca is not a ""big"" team in terms of money and attracting big players. "
Okay good. I just know that theres a huge amount of disrespect on here for SA clubs and id hate to be lumped into that group
"Of course, no offense taken. I understand that it can be hard to watch, and in todays money driven environment we are not technically great. Still fun though, we have a cabal of colombians in the team right now who are a proper riot. And tbh I do think we are bigger then many european clubs, but what “big team” fan doesnt?"
"Also! If you feel like dropping 10 bucks a month, fanatiz.com legally streams all south american big leagues. I know its a good amount of cash, but if you want to give it a gander its good quality."
"So you didn't start watching when Gareth Bale was the hottest shit in the League? Or was it after when Kane became top scorer in his first season? 

I know it wasn't before then. You never struggled with your team. You **picked** them because them as soon as they became a top 6 regular.

Lmfao. You're so dense."
"To your point Boca's actually one of the most successful teams on their international tournament, so you can argue that they do.

That and they're one of the biggest teams in a place where the sport is universally loved. Not really sure why you hate Boca so much or why you're resisting the idea that there's big clubs outside of Europe."
"I mean we attract pretty big players for our monetary capability. The name carries weight. But thats besides the point: I, and many others on this sub, are saying that to be a big club you need to have more then money, and that other aspects weigh more then money. Chinese clubs can attract good players with loads of cash, and yet they are not big clubs. Boca is. At this point it seems like you are being purposefully obstinate towards the point of view I am putting forward."
"This sub is pure cancer sometimes with it's hate against SA teams, but you're fine man, don't worry about it."
"I’ve been watching since the Friedel days lmao. Act condescending all you want, I don’t care what you think about my fandom. "
"> Not really sure why you hate Boca so much

I have absolutely nothing against Boca. I am not insulting Boca, I am not dismissing all that they have achieved in the sport and their rich history, as i have said in other posts.

My argument this entire time, has been that they are not a big club in the sense of; money, attracting big name players, and status in today's game. 

THAT is what i'm trying to say here. Can they attract big name players? No. When was the last time they won an international event? 10 or 11 years ago?

Boca is a fantastic team with a rich history, an absolutely enormous fan base, a scary away game, and very nice kits. But they're not competing with other ""big"" teams in terms of status, money, and ability to attract big players."
"oh my god it's like nobody reads anything i say on here. Picks one thing to focus on and reply to.

>And Boca is not a ""big"" team in terms of money and attracting big players.

Are Boca a big team when it comes to signing big players?

No.

There you go."
"So sometime around 2011...lol exactly

No wonder you say such ignorant things. I'm not being condescending. Thats **literally** around the time they became a top 6 regular. Lmao. Sorry for stating factual information."
"You know what, fuck it, we are: we sign pretty big name players. Why not."
"Also, its not that people dont read your comments, its that we disagree with you. You keep on bringing up
That we dont bring in big names (which we actually kinda do) and ignore the fact that THAT DOESNT MATTER NEARLY AS MUCH AS YOU THINK TO MOST PEOPLE when determining what a big club is!"
"you bring in mid tier players. 

And i've been talking about different aspects of what constitutes as a big club in modern day football. One of which being winning trophies, making money, and signing big players. When was the last time Boca won an international event? 11 years? 12 years?"

How about Barcelona players stop avoiding taxes and pay their fair contribution to society - virtue signal that.

edit: for the downvoters, no this was not a leak, yes Barcelona are claiming this supports their ""charitable character"" - read the article, you're all being played."
It's so weird living in a world where a football club on the other side of the world treats you better during a tragedy than your own president. 
youth teams
I believe it’s a Barcelona academy for young players around the world.
"Youth teams.
Escola means school in catalan, and FCB is, well, FC Barcelona."
If I'm not mistaken they are academies in other countries under Barcelona guidelines? What I'm not sure if they are managed by Barcelona directly or they just pay to follow some Barcelona methodology.
How the hell does Alex Jones have such a large following?
Probably Trumpede gun nuts who believe that the shooting was fake and the all the kids are crisis actors.
"It's 91% up voted?

Wtf are you talking about? "
holy shit dude if thats all you took from this story youre a really sad person
god youre such a shithead
What do you mean?  Do you expect Barcelona to treat everyone with even the slightest association with the club like this for no reason?  That's ignorant.  
That hit home. More than a club indeed. 
This comment deserves gold
Damn...Trump is such an embarrassment to me as an American. 
"> It used to be weird living in a world where a football club on the other side of the world treats you better during a tragedy than your own president.

FTFW"
"The latter of your comment.

Every one I have seen in the US at least is just a money grab."
Same reason a celebrity was elected president. 
"Yanks just looove their guns, and mass shootings offer an excuse for the govt to implement better gun control. So according to them ,every single mass shooting is a conspiracy by the government to steal their guns. "
People are stupid sometimes
"I used to love listening to him about 7 or 8 years ago. It was just crazy conspiracy theories that nobody would talk about. I stopped listening to him about 4 years ago and he was still the same way, he had some great cohosts that really made the shows greay. I tried listening to him about 2 years ago and the guy had turned into an absolute loony bin. I have never listened to him since. "
I sometimes watch him just for laughs. Guys a comedian
"I know this is going to be taken with a grain of salt because its a personal opinion but the real reason is that quite frankly theyve been failed by our system. My girlfriends dad is someone who watches alex jones 24/7, he isint racist or dumb, hes actually intelligent and knows alot about a few different subjects but the main reason is vaccinations. He really believes they ruined some of his kids and also his mom had cancer, and instead of getting revac'd like what was recommended by her doctor she avoided it and she hasnt had a relapse. That was 9 years ago. Im currently sitting in a car listening to it now and its a bit out there yes but really this comes down to just reading memes and other blown up pieces of BS. He is super far right though "
"I really fucking hate those kinds of guys.

9/11 was staged!
Columbine shooting was staged!
Boston bomb was staged!
Florida shooting was staged!

""oh my god, look at that guy crying over the loss of his friend at the -shooting-, he was about to laugh at around 4:21!!!!! You see people!? It's staged!""

"
"All shootings are fake, unless it was done by a brown person."
"I don't wish tragedy on anyone but for people like that, the only way for them to ever, ever come to grips with how horrible the gun crisis is in the USA is for them or people close to them to suffer from an attack. It's called empathy, folks. And when you don't have empathy -- literally can't feel others' suffering -- then the only way to see the light is to suffer yourself. "
But the Orlando shooting was super real though!
It was 30% upvoted when I made that comment.
"lol, what a fucking naive dick YOU are, what's the big deal if a multi-million pound organisation responds to a huge tragedy with a small financial contribution and then wants to get publicity off it? 
 If they had any class, they should have done this privately and discreetly for the sake of the family. I'm the honourable one here not you or your other moron downvoters above




"
"No, but I don't expect them to exploit a tragedy for publicity reasons, why not offer this in private to the family - do you think the family want all the publicity associated with their trip to Barcelona? People died, show some fucking respect."
"No, still weird."
A celebrity who appeared on Alex Jones' insane show no less.
Because his competitor was Hillary Clinton.
"Ok, but Reagan was elected and he was an actor and celebrity "
">every single mass shooting is a conspiracy by the government to steal their guns.

Actually mass shootings are an oppurtunity for gun nuts to push the narrative that more guns are needed to protect against the people with guns doing the mass shootings."
lets not put a blanket on the opinions of 300 million people. a lot of Americans wish there was a lot more gun control.
Blame the Brits for that
Alright let's not get into all of this.. 
Sometimes?
I dont really find it funny or interesting
Occam's razor is hard for some
"Bots maybe? Some subs have had that problem recently. Besides, with all that downvoting I'd expect 4 or 5 retarded comments and I have yet to see even one."
"""I'm the honourable one here"" have you tried to be less mentally handicapped"
"It’s a sign of fucking respect to the kid who put his life on the line for his classmates. He’s a footballer, and Barcelona felt it fit to invite him to Barce. Furthermore, Barcelona does this *all the time* when tragedies happen(or did you forget about the chapacoense charity match?). 

This isn’t about pr, financial issues, or anything else other than them giving a hero the opportunity to meet some of the best footballers in the world, and visit one of the best clubs in the world. "
Hey do us all a favor and fuck right off. Thx. 
"Companies/corporations/Business entities don't have morals.

You judging the FCB intention on this matter is stupid, because you act like they should have morals when we all here already know that they don't. With business entities, it's **always** about business. Thinking otherwise is naive.

Also, every business need good PR, there's no way around that.
So when the PR make some paralyzed kid happy, it's a win-win for both of them."
"I didn't read the article, but I'm assuming this was more of a leak rather than a publicity scheme"
Coincidence? I think not!
"He crushed the rest of the Republican field as well. Whatever message he was peddling, it was being lapped up well before the general election."
"Before he became president, Reagan was the Governor of California for 8 years.

He may have been an actor, but he had the political experience one would expect from a presidential candidate.

Equating Reagan to Trump is both silly and insulting to Reagan.

"
There was an armed officer outside the school who was too much of a pussy to take the shooter down
Sometimes they're stupid all the time
"Well there are many thing you don't find funny & interesting but rest of the world does. For example , Arsenal FanTV or Arsenal vs Bayern Munich."
"What a disgusting comment, you should be ashamed, but like many people these days, I doubt you have the ability to feel shame for what you say in public"
CAN'T THEY DO IT PRIVATELY? 
"Well, you should have read the article, google translation of last paragraph:

>""[...]What we did was to make ourselves available to the family so that, as a club, we could help them with whatever they needed, ""explains Arroyo to La Vanguardia, confirming the charitable character of Barça.

Yeah, read that, confirming the charitable character of Barca, to the Spanish media"
I both agree with you and think that Reagan should be degraded and insulted.
"I've heard it before in other school shooting incidents along the lines of ""if the teacher had a gun they could have done something"""
There were 4 others who have been identified that were outside the scene and didn't go in
Not sure what's more fucked. The fact that a cop didn't do his job or the fact that already schools in the US already have arm securities for this type of event.... Who's the third world country here?
correct answer
Have you tried not virtue signalling 
"Who fucking cares if they do it privately. You’re taking this way too seriously, Barcelona’s doing a good thing for a good kid and you’re trying to find every reason you can to make them out as bad guys. "
Its fucking 2018.  Very little happens privately anymore.
Okay so it is for publicity.  If I'm the kid idc and neither should you.  Also just because they are trying to look good doesn't mean they don't have good intentions either
"> confirming the charitable character of Barça

That part is outside of quotes. It's a statement from the author of the article."
" >confirming the charitable character of Barça

Isn't that a remark by the reporter ?"
Do you not know how quotes work? 
"Are you like, 10 years old? Us adults, with some intelligence, see this as a shitty, cheap, publicity stunt for the club to  ""confirm the charitable character of Barça."" (read the article).

Disgusting on so many levels, and all the dweebs downvoting me can fuck off, don't care, I get thousands of votes for my honesty and correct analysis  here regularly, while you lot just rot in your shitpool of mediocrity "
"God you’re so upset over charity. You’re a literal piece of shit, and the fact that you care so much about your “thousands of internet points because of your honesty” just proves that. You need help, you need a psychiatrist if you think your internet points and hate for charitable acts is okay. 

Barcelona does this every time a tragedy happens that affects the football world. A representative of the club saying “because Barcelona is a charitable club” doesn’t mean that they’re doing it solely for publicity. You can do good things for the sake of being good and also get positive pr out of it, those two things aren’t mutually exclusive. 

And lastly, this comment belongs on r/iamverysmart "
And you can fuck off for thinking you speak for all adults. 
"You're so naive. The club has millionaire players avoiding taxes that would benefit the poorest in society but you're so blind to fall for the simplest of publicity stunts exploiting a tragedy to deflect from that.


Crazy. You deserve your wage in the current economy btw, which is obviously not much"
"Where did I ever say anything about Barcelona being some innocent great club? The fact is that you’re trying to shit on a club for doing something good because you don’t like other things that they do. It’s not the time or the place, instead of trying to hate on Barcelona in a thread talking about a kid who got fucking shot five times, how about you go type up your own posts about tax evasion in football. 

Since you’re so knowledgeable and honest, this should be easy internet points for you to get and consequently brag about, right?

I always love tough guys like you who act like they know everything. “You deserve your wage in the current economy, which obviously is not much”

My current wages are none of your business, but at 19 years old I make 50 an hour for half the year(while my business is in season). Obviously that must be such a low amount and has a clear effect on my judgement skills right? Because hourly wage = intelligence? Naivety and wage are obviously linked, I don’t know how I forgot that one too! 

"
"50 an hour for you sounds way too much, considering my two interactions with you in life clearly demonstrate that you are a fucking dick.

No I won't make a post about tax evasion, instead I'll BRAVELY call out shit when I see it, Barcelona should have done all of this in private - do the family want cameras on them after this tragedy when they probably have close friends killed? Just so Barcelona can advertise their charitable status?"

di Maria in
is it going to be Brazil vs Germany all over again?
Goodbye Balon D'Or for another year. Hello Mbappe's shadow. 
"google says his sister´s birthday is March 11th. 3 weeks takes us to March 18th,  weekend after. wow.

I think brazillians should not worry too much about this medical issue for the world cup."
"Okay, this is unfortunate. I was really looking forward to see what full strength PSG can do at home. "
">Sky Sports News understands the Brazilian initially feared that his season was over after suspecting he had suffered a broken ankle in the tackle.

But he wasn't tackled tho? He got his foot stuck in the grass and twisted his ankle, it was a non-contact injury. I'm hesitant to trust this source if they don't even know how Neymar got hurt. "
He's on the plane on his way to his sisters birthday as we speak.
"Do Sky Sports have many French sources? They don't show French football, don't show the Champions League, and don't really give a shit about the league so it's a bit weird that they're breaking this news."
"Ouch. The way Neymar was in pain yesterday, it didn't seem like an injury he could recover from in a week. Unfortunate for him. I know how much he loves that competition. "
Sisters birthday ✔
I cannot understand why Emery didn't rest his starters. You are 14 points clear of 2nd place. What is the point of playing a full team ahead of your CL match? Give them 2 matchdays off and this doesn't happen. Next week they play relegation bound Troyes and will surely rest players then. Would one more game make all that difference? Emery is weird.
They still have draxler and dimaria rigth?
eat shit nasser
doubt they would've won anyway.
Imagine the scenes if a Neymar-less PSG come back and beat Real. Would be hysterical. 
"It's always great to have more Champions League nights in Paris, but now we're getting eliminated earlier and earlier ..."
Madrid going through regardless. Not many teams can beat them in the CL over 2 legs currently. This is what they have left to play for this season and they’re starting to click again just in time for CL knockouts.
"French media is a bit more optimistic than that....

He should be ok. And if he's not, Di Maria is red hot at the moment."
Pulling a Gotze.
Based on what though? It keeps saying “as Sky Sports understands” as if that means anything.
Scenes when Mbappe carries PSG to the CL title and Neymar has to go play in Angola to get out of all the shadows he's under.
I sense a 7x1 approaching....
I honestly thought it would be much longer or worse. I hope he makes a quick recovery and this doesn't slow him down at all.
Everything falling in place for Madrid to make another deep CL run
Neymar and missing critical matches...
I'm not reading any source here. I will wait for the official information.
"Neymar missed a Clasico with Barca. People said ""Barca is getting wrecked"". We ended up winning.

Conclusion: Sometimes it is actually beneficial "
"I still think he'll play. Most of those next-day-predictions tend to be way exaggerated. He may not be 100% recovered, but he'll be able to play."
Eh doesn’t matter they are already basically out of champions league. Now they have an excuse for their poor performance at least...
Neymar should've used Commando Pro smh
"damn, he tore nacho a new one a few weeks back as well and easily was the most dangerous player on the park"
"Going to be longer than 3 weeks, he also fractured his fifth metatarsal.

Hopefully it's not a Jones fracture, those are a *bitch*"
"Got to be a huge bummer for neutrals.

And kind of feel for him too, he'll have to sit out his biggest game of the season.


"
"If PSG are eliminated from CL, would Neymar just take it easy until the world cup in order to avoid re-injury?"
Taxi for Emery.
no sources lol
Fake news
"
I wish i had half of Zidane's luck.

1/4 even."
"I don’t join in the Neymar hate on here and I think he’s a marvelous player, but I really do think this might force PSG to play better tactically. 

The tactics in the first leg seemed to be “let’s see what Neymar can make happen” and it just didn’t work. 

He might be the third best player in the world (sorry Kevin), but no club can play that way against RM, not even Barca. 

And this isn’t a knock on Neymar. It’s a knock on PSG management. 
I’d like to see this prompt some better flowing attack, maybe even a chance for Mbappe to actually be used to his potential. 

I suspect Mbappe’s speed could cause RM a lot more problems than Neymar’s skill did, in large part cause RM doesn’t already have years of experience dealing with Mbappe. 

No matter how great he is, Neymar is old news to RM."
Would it have really made a difference? Madrid will walk over them
rip
Noice
My man Neymar needs some horse placenta. 
this kills the psg 
Maybe Guardiola can let PSG borrow his ‘doctors’ 
Let's be thankful it's only 3 weeks. I don't like his ego but he's fun to watch.
isnt it his sisters birthday
"Rub some oil and money on it, he'll be fine!"
The excitement has been collapsed!
hope PSG don't starting making excuses when they're knocked out
he pulled his fanny.
gg
"Just like Brazil in the semi's, i think Neymar being out will cause PSG's confidence to deflate if they concede early."
Maybe they’ll actually win now. 
They cite no source and the biggest french media have said many times that it's anyone's guess at this point ... I want to believe still 
They goes my otw investment
RIP P$G
But actually wait until Mbappe scores the 2-0 against Madrid in the 89th and becomes a legend. The shadow grows. 
"Damn, I'm sure Madrid fans are fine with this but that's a real bummer from a neutral perspective. I think the Madrid game will be less entertaining now for sure."
[deleted]
Fuck
Oh yeah!
Neymar being injured makes PSG an actual threat against Real Madrid. 
Best 2nd place in the group stage ever.
PSG will never win the CL.
Bye bye psg

"PSG may actually play better with Di Maria pressing, defending and being more unselfish. After all, they didn't have Neymar when they whooped Barça's ass in the first leg  last season"
Well looks like RM are through to the quarters
Bad news for Real Madrid. PSG is a better team without Neymar.
"He totally planned this, Real will buy him in the summer now"
Unpopular opinion but i think PSG will have a better chance of comeback without Neymar.
"Just remember that Emery, di Maria, and cavani were enough to 4-0 Messi, Suarez, and neymar. Zidane has a tough task ahead!! They didn't score enough in the penalbeu"
out for 3 weeks? The way he responded on the pitch I thought he was going to have to lose the leg.
why wouldnt they just rest all their players lol its not like their league matters
"Can't believe this shit source is getting upvoted, an actual [reliable journalist for PSG](https://twitter.com/jon_legossip/status/968179245959843845) has come out and said otherwise. I hate PSG but come on.

Better yet, let's wait for an official statement from PSG."
The luck if champions league for penal madrid
"Zidane said that he wants Neymar to play, but he has also said very recently that he likes his job and he wants to keep it, then why does he want Neymar to play, he has a higher chance of keeping his job if Neymar doesn't play!"
He probably knows he won’t beat Real without Messi so thought may as well get some time off. 
rip to all those that betted on PSG winning the CL.
He joined PSG to make history. /s
Good news for PSG as he will now be able to concentrate exclusively in winning their highly contested world-class league. 
Mpapi will tear them to shreds from the left and Di Maria can have his revenge. Perfect.
Fake news.
GG PSG.

Not like anyone besides Messi or Ronaldo has a chance anyways. 
if they advance (highly unlikely) without him it would be hilarious
Hello darkness my old friend

"Why would he even be nominated?
They were going to lose with him anyway.
He's done nothing special this year.

PSG is overrated "
"Has Neymar even been good enough for it? I haven't followed him this season.

Surely Harry Kane, Salah, and KDB are equally in for a shout as they're all having incredible seasons.

I'm very England centric so any other lads in other leagues having blinders? I'm tired of Neymar being assumed to win it."
">Hello Mbappe's shadow.

 
that's racist"
"Goodbye trophies for another year. Hello Arsenal’s shadow.

Lmao, the fact that you potatoes actually believe this source lmao."
"Every year he finds a creative way to free up his schedule for his sister's birthday. Next year, around the same time, he’ll have North Korean assassins dart poison him in the middle of the game"
"He did get himself red carded once or twice, while at Barcelona, so he can be free on march11th."
"> 3 weeks takes us to March 12th

ok either im crazy or its flying over everyones head that 3 weeks takes us to march 19th, not the 12th"
What's the deal with his sister?
"If you think about it, he twisted his foot without contact .... holy shit

brb creatring /r/soccer_conspiracies"
I never understood why he has to go to Brazil and can't simply fly his whole family to europe for a week. Not like he can't afford it. 
He almost had me convinced with all that crying and the stretcher. Thanks for revealing the real facts lol.
it would've looked suspicious to get a card 3 years in a row so he decided to try a different thing
Neymar don't wins games. Tite does. I don't care what happens to him.
"I mean with only Di Maria and Cavani they won 4-0 against Barcelona with Messi and Neymar on the other side.

Now they have Mbappe too. Their team is really strong even without Neymar the problem is the opponent and the competition."
"I hope he is able to play, but honestly, his over dribbling and careless play with the ball was advantageous to us in the last match. "
"tbh i really really do think he will play. not trusting sky on this one.

edit: as u/ClausXwarsama noted below, the article mentioned that he hurt his ankle via a tackle, which is untrue as it was through a non-contact injury. if you can't even get that part right, can't be trusted imo"
"It's unfortunate for both teams. We'll likely be out one or two key players as well. It's going to be a very tough game, PSG still have a very good fighting chance. "
It’s still not going to be an easy second leg for Real.
Looked like he tried too tackle. 
exactly. he'll be back in a week. this is the first source that's said he's definitely not playing.
Playing csgo. He is like I didn’t even want to beat Madrid. Csgo for the next weeks letssss gooo. 
Thierry Henry 
"> Do Sky Sports have many French sources?

No. Not sure why everyone is believing this story. We have no way to know if it is true or not."
"Globoesporte, from Brazil, just released an article saying that people around Neymar are confident he will play vs Madrid.

https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/futebol-internacional/futebol-frances/noticia/neymar-faz-exames-e-entorno-do-astro-mostra-confianca-em-volta-contra-o-real.ghtml"
they dont
"It's...like the only competition he got. For Psg the CL is legit the only highlight of the year, sucks for Neymar having to watch his team lose"
UCL only comes second to his sister's birthday!
"Tbh idk what was Emery thinking, 60 minutes in, 2-0 comfortably up, why not sub your key player before the biggest match of the season. With the bench they have! Messi and Ronaldo have styles which makes them avoid major injuries, but Neymar gets small knock here and there all the time. "
"PSG-OM is THE biggest rivalry in France though.
No matter the point gap, I doubt you'd see players being rested for Barça-Real or United-Liverpool because there's a big game 10 days ahead"
PSG-OM is the biggest game of the year for PSG fans and especially in this context where Marseille arent doing too bad. He should have been subbed at 3-0 but hindsight is 20/20 and Neymar is the kind of player that doesnt get subbed if he doesnt want to. 
"What if he’s into that though? It’s like me being told to eat pizza, I’d be like ‘ok’"
He will meet your release clause /u/nichequiche.
I'd worry about your team being so shit than Al Nasser.  
"Wait, do people on this sub actually hate Nasser ? I always thought he'd have a decent reputation on here, as an invested owner/president who actually cares about the team he runs. And he's been pretty classy most of the times, especially with smaller clubs and team owners. 

Why the hate ? Is it because he is the head of the Qatari Money Snake in football ?"
top notch comments in r/soccer. 
Every single hate comment you write makes any win we get ten times better.
No it woudnt 
"Oh, the memes"
Lyon will save the ranking np
"Honestly at this point the only team i feel like is capable of stopping Madrid in the CL is us

And i do not like that one bit"
"> Di Maria is red hot at the moment.

which is a guarantee he won't be next week"
"The fucking fool, he would then be in the shadow of Tiago Azulao, the top scorer of Girabola. 

He could be a starter for Bravos de Maquis, tho."
Brazilian developed a 6th sense when it comes to 7-1
Messi is a little better than Mbappe tho
I would assume so not much else to play for
Oh piss off
I wish we had the OGs and Shit defending that Barcelona is rewarded with when playing in league
Neymar was taking on RM players for fun last time they played so they certainly haven't got him figured out. If anything Mbappe was terrible every time he got the ball he tried making something happen but kept on losing the ball.
Don't jinx it please
"Di Maria is on fire tho, he might end up delivering more end product than Neymar."
"Not a chance after the amount they spent last summer. No one will say ""PSG was eliminated after playing against Real Madrid without Neymar"", they'll say ""they couldn't even make it to the quarter finals""

"
"why do you care about barca fans? or anyone else? Enjoy your cake. :)

Other fans will always try to discredit the victories or trophies of other rivals, we have seen similar thing happening where people are going on about saying you can't be the best team in the world if you don't win the league but the truth there will be always be arguments, hell we might had said the same shit if we were them, Enjoy our win and carry along. :)"
Marcelo? No problem last game Theo proved that he can be as good as Marcelo with his dribbling past everyone and better than Marcelo at defending/not getting caught off position. Modric? No problem Kovacic is doing great now. Only problem is that Kroos is irreplaceable but i think Asensio/Isco will do their job good. We also have lead so we can safely park the bus if its needed.
Really mate?

"I don't know about that. The last player to win the Ballon d'or without winning the CL was Ronaldo in 12-13. And the before that is Messi in 09-10. You then have to go all the way to 2004 with Andriy Shevchenko before that(and Milan won it the year before). 
 
I think the odds of the next winner of the Ballon d'or not winning the CL this year is pretty slim. Even with the World Cup. "
"World Cup will of course play a big part, but Champions League is arguably as big when you look at the history of the winners. "
"That's not really true though. 2014 germany won world cup, plus treble for Bayern in the Cl and Dortmund second place. Who won Ballon d'or that year though? "
"Neuer won the WC and didn't get it cause CR7 won stuff with the club


Worldcup means nothing if Messi or CR7 aren't winning it.

Its a publicity event"
you overestimate the WC.
"Lol no. Just like the last 11 years, the top scorer of the CL will win the ballon D'or. What makes this year any different? We've had non World Cup winners win it before twice in the last decade."
If Messi continues like this and Barca win the treble he has it locked down
"I would argue that all of kane, de bruyne, and salah have done more this season to deserve a nomination over cr7 this season."
">They were going to lose with him anyway.

How's the future like, tell me more"
"He has some of the most ridiculous numbers ive ever seen from a player up to this point. Its beyond ""great season"". So i'd say individually he deserves to win it but i know team honors play a huge part in such contests. Fortunately he has a pretty good chance with Brazil."
Are you being ironic?

"*after his sisters birthday*
“Hey guys that was a prank but I’m back to play”"
since this has come up again: there was a comment here either an year or two ago where someone very bluntly stated that Neymar is ''shagging his sister'' and it made me laugh out loud. Been trying to find it ever since - does anyone else remember that? can someone find it for me?
Fucking up his ankle is a whole other level of commitment though!
"Last year he just fucked off for no apparent reason. Wasn't injured, wasn't suspended, just took a break and didn't play vs Depor. 

Couldn't be mad at him since it was right after the 6-1 (even though the Depor game might have cost us La Liga in the end), but it's still such a ridiculous habit of his."
You're not crazy.
I thought it would get us to april 9th ?

"You are right, my bad. OTOH if party is on the weekend or day after, still excellent timing."

So wholesome of you to think that it's about family...
They adopted a counter attacking strategy and Barcelona played into their hands that game. I doubt Madrid will do the same.
I'm worried about their mentality going into the game. Losing your best player to injury right before can shake you mentally despite the fact that they have enough quality to play for a win.
"Come on man, you just know it's over if Neymar is off.

Edit: Well, up to you then."
I don't know about that. The most clear opportunities came from that band. Everyone blaming Neymar bc they didn't score but he was actually the most dangerous player in their attack. It isn't his fault that they basically attacked only with Neymar+Cavani.    
"Psg's strategy looked like it was just ""pass to Neymar"" even if he's at the halfway line."
"Sky is not the only media saying most probably he won't play. That injury (""esguince + fisura"" in spanish) is easily a 1 month injury, which is even worse for players that dribble so much."
Why tf is this down voted
"He could have easily sustained a ligament sprain or peroneal tendon strain from that ankle roll, both take a while to heal. Not saying that is what happened, just that it is within the realm of possibility.

"
"He's a pundit, not a source. "
Nonsense. Thierry couldn't even hold back his shock at Brendan's firing. I think we've all learned that keeping secrets from him until a big reveal is way more fun.
he has no informations on PSG
Remember when everybody believed Mbappe was out for 4 months or something? I think it's the same thing now. No French website is confirming this story either.
I really don't think Neymar is so indispensable that they can't possibly win without him. Discounting PSG straight out seems rather silly.
"who knows. Maybe PSG will win without him, which says even more about them. Despite all adversity to come through but yea, if they don't, that is unfortunate for Neymar. It happened to him with Brazil when he was injured and couldn't help his team. It is now happening with PSG but it's not a long-term injury. They just have to get through this one match"
"The difference is that winning the domestic league for those clubs is AS important as CL. I highly doubt winning Ligue 1 is as important for PSG as CL. CL is the reason they brought Neymar in. I'm not advocating throwing a team full of reserves on the field, but in the very least, sub your best players off at half time (PSG was up 2-0). "
PSG -OM heard is bigger than Real Madrid- Barcelona.

"I cant speak for everyone but for me personally , Yes.  Nothing against the man personally but I dislike what he represents"
"Putting aside the fact that he owns slaves and his government finances international terrorism, he probably encouraged Di Maria not to show up for pre-season training with United to force his move out of the club. I'll never understand why United rewarded that kind of behavior by agreeing to sell him to PSG. If I were Woodward, he'd be forced to play in the reserves until there was only a year left in his contract. Then he could be sold to any Arab dictatorship-owned club he likes."
4-3 win after leading 4-0 then conceding a 90+5 hat trick from Ramos to lose the tie? 
How do man city not bother you?

"I want to refute your accusation, then after my anger calms down, I realized how cheeky this post is."
"What, it's a good thing.

I envy you."
We're not to blame that you were awful this season.
"You’re not wrong but it was almost all individual. How many chances did Neymar create and how much did he trouble the overall defense when he beat those players?

I think RM knows you can’t ever really stop a player Neymar from winning battles, but you can still leave him isolated and contain him from turning that creativity into too many scoring chances. 

And ya know part of that may be on Neymar’s teammates as well. Could they do more, or better, to play off the situations where he takes out a couple of defenders?

Neymar shouldn’t have to beat the whole team. There should be a system where lots of people are moving into openings created by his dribbles and moves, and I didn’t see that in the first leg. "
"Well it's true, if you don't win the league you can't call yourself the best team in your country, so I don't know why you should be considered the best team in the world."
He's not your mate guy. 
He was selfish against Madrid though. 
"here's what one of the best spanish analists sayd about his game vs OM https://twitter.com/maldiniplus/status/967898997150175232

""Very individualist. spectacular, but he forgets about the team"""
The meme of putting some form of the word 'penalty' in anything relating to RM/Ronaldo is so tired.
"Yeah I'm quite neutral when it comes to teams I don't have any affection with.

> ... unless madrid is in the discussion where you go full guns blazing.

What do you mean? Do I really sound that way? I haven't noticed it myself I guess. I don't have any bad history with Real Madrid. I guess I've begun to dislike them a bit because they've had so much success lately. 

I had the same thing with Barcelona from 2009 to 2014 or something like that. Also I have a soft spot for Atleti when it comes to teams from Madrid. 

But I don't think I've made any ""unjust"" comments when it comes to RM. I mean I recall times I've defended you guys when somebody has made an inappropriate comment or just said something that's wrong etc.. I had no problems acknowledging the fact that Zidane had his substitutes spot on in the previous match etc. I watched RM - Alavés in the weekend and enjoyed the match.

In this case I just want PSG to advance because I really like some of their players like Mbappé, Verratti, Cavani, Rabiot, Meunier & Kimpembe. I just couldn't stand the thought of RM winning the CL for the 3rd time in a row. Something that even the incredible Barcelona side couldn't do. They couldn't even win it twice in a row.

I do like some of your players too. Modrić, Kovacic, Varane, Carvajal to name a few. Not too big on Casemiro though.

But to answer your question? Man United. 

And the fact that we were knocked out by Real Madrid from the CL like twice (once with Fergie once with Moyes?) has got nothing to do with it. That Nani red card hurt a bit, but on both occasions you were the better team. That Ronaldo hat-trick at Old Trafford was something else.

If there's one team I truly loathe it's Man City."

"Are we officially without them? I thought Marcelo and Modric still had a chance to play, or am I mistaken?"
"You are leading quite well, so no need to sweat it. Though I really hope Madrid won't park the bus because that almost always backfires. "

"Last time he was fit but didn't play for ""sporting reason"",  take that as you will"
"No fucking way. Messi could very well win it in this case, but Neymar would surely be the favorite. WC is fucking everything for Ballon d'Or. Messi would most likely take The Best from FIFA, but even that I doubt."
What if mancity win the treble and Belgium win the World Cup with 5 goals and assists from KBD
I don't think Brazil is good enough to win the WC. I really like France to win it all. 
"it´s not like Messi or Neymar or even Cristiano Ronaldo are the only options.  Suker was second one year also, Fabio Cannavaro won it. If Belgium or Uruguay win it, if there is a great player in an unlikely winner, well it´s the world cup, it matters a whole lot more."
"first of all Messi cant win champions, Barca is super bad and sucked against a subpar Chelsea already

second, yes, if Brazil wins they will all pump up Neymar also most ppl are bored of CR and Messi and will gladly vote for a newcomer

They would probably vote for a newcomer even if he was someone new from other countries probably"
"Why do we act like any awards mean anything? Especially music awards, where 99.9% of acts aren't even under consideration.

It is all show and spectacle designed to spark debate amongst the fans about who is truly ""better"" - and it works, year after year."
"Because it still matters in the end. Your name is still recorded among the greatest of all time. In 50 years or so, the younger generations probably won't know who Sneijder is because he played during the CR7 Messi era. Same for us, we know that Lev Yachin won the ballon d'or but who can name the other great players at that time ? Only the likes of Maradona and Pele left a big enough mark on the football history are remembered. How many knows about Garrincha or even Socrates tho ? You know Luis Alberto, Zico, etc but there are so many high level players in history that didn't have the fame they deserved. For instance, Aguero/Lewandowski imo will not be known by a lot of younger people later even if they are the most dominant strikers in our era."
Its still the highest individual honor so its got to  mean something.
"Depends who you ask when someone wins. Messi wins it, Ronaldo fans will say who cares but fans of Messi will care a lot. Ronaldo wins and the opposite happens. "
"Even if we only consider it to be a contest of strikers, it’s still useful to compare strikers. Also if we consider it partly popularity contest, then it’s similar to the NBA mvp/all star, which is still important. However in both sports championships still matter, and I’m sure players and fans would rather have a CL trophy or league trophy vs a ballon dor"
"It's just fun. You are always going to have people that agree or disagree with who wins, but the winners are rarely egregious or undeserving. It will be more fun again when Messi and Ronaldo retire."
It definitely matters to most people that play the sport. Most people love recognition so to be recognized as the best in the world at what you do means something to most of the players. 
"Because players still want to win the award, year after year "
It will mean something once Messi and Cristiano stop winning it undeservedly!
He moved to get it 
"Is there anyone from Spain who performed better than Messi the year they won? Their stars played in Barcelona ffs and it was clear to anyone with eyes and a brain that Messi was the best. 
"
It is weird that someone with your crest would seemingly leave out 11-12 as a season in which someone won the Ballon d'Or but did not win the CL.
"I have been looking at the history of winners for longer than  the last 10 years, which is why I am saying this ..."

Zidane is not to blame that your or any other team can't win CL
"Because not everything is one dimensional. Imagine the team which qualified on the fourth spot of group qualifiers for asia or africa and goes on to win the world cup, it wasn't the best team in their own continent so how can it be the best team in the world?

Champions League is branded as the best international competition, winning it signifies your achievements in global scale, I am not saying national sides don't have any value but if some X team won CL and Y team won national league, which team will have a better hand in claiming themselves as the best team in the world, X cl winners or Y (different teams from different leagues)? Obviously its not a clear majority but still X team has more right to claim themselves as the world beater."

Couldve just wanted to put in Kimpembe more. He's a really good cb for his age. 
Thiago is a world class defender but tbh he's kind of mentally fragile to be the captain. I feel like I've seen him cry way too many times. And Kimpembe was an absolute tank against Barca last year.

"Explain 2010, 2014, etc. I think you underestimate how Messi and Ronaldo generate automatic votes especially when they keep producing at their insane levels. 

Now if Neymar has a god-level World Cup that’s different but if he leads Brazil to the WC with good/very good stats, I don’t think it’ll be enough if Messi/Ronaldo end with trophies/40-50 goals and 20-30 assists (Messi). 

But I guess we’ll see"
"since when did winning the world cup meant winning the balon dor ? iniesta won the world cup but still didn't win the ballon dor over the messi that won the league only, and you're telling me someone that won the world cup will win the ballon dor over a treble winning messi ? how does that even make sense ? world cup vs league title didn't win but somehow world cup vs treble will definitely win ?"
"i think it depends on the champions league in that case.

If Messi wins the CL and gets to the QF of the WC then i think he'd be the winner. It might depend on how argentina do. They don't have to win, but they've gotta do SOMETHING. "
"> WC is fucking everything for Ballon d'Or. 

So that is why Ronaldo (who couldnt even leave groups over fucking murica with his team lmao) got it over Neuer who actually won the WC and was one of the key players for his team in 2014? Or thats why Messi won it in 2010 even though his team got stomped by Germany in QF's? A Sneijder won the treble that year and got to the WC Final and it didnt help him at all for ballon d'or either, nobody is gonna win it until Messi and Ronaldo retire.

Messi and Ronaldo are fucking everything for Ballon d'Or, FTFY."
"Dont think he'd be the favorite. Argentina have more going forward now than they did in 2014 and they still reached the final.

With Messi playing like he is now along with Aguero, Dybala and Di Maria all continuing their form id say they're at par with Brazil."
"I wouldn't bet on us. Maybe in 2022? We have the potential for it, but imo the team is too young to win it rn."
"Sneijder lost out to Messi after a treble with Inter and for the most part carrying Nederlands to the WC Final. I highly doubt anyone besides Messi and Ronaldo are going to win it again, as Cristiano has been back in top form since the New Year."
You're acting like the Balon d'Or isn't a popularity contest.

"Aguero will be known by every person who follows English football. You don't score that goal against QPR and not be remembered forever and ever. Especially in the modern era where that shit has been plastered all over marketing material for years since and with City looking like they're going to remain a top club for years to come.

"
If it's in an individual sport? Sure I 100% agree.
"As a Liverpool fan I cbf when Owen won it, cbf when Gerrard got 2nd, cbf when Messi won it, same for Ronaldo.

Ballon d'Or for me is like a piece of tissue paper on a restaurant table, if they have it, cool, if they don't, no worries, I came here for the delicious food."
"> I’m sure players and fans would rather have a CL trophy or league trophy vs a ballon dor

Ronaldo won that past two awards *because* his team won the CL."
"The only time a World Cup winner has exclusively won the Balon D'Or in the past 16 years is Fabio Cannavaro. Ronaldo won in 2002 but he also won the the Champions League that year with Real Madrid.

Messi won ahead of WC winners Iniesta and Xavi in 2010 (without winning the CL either), and Ronaldo (CL winner) ahead of Messi and Neuer (WC finalists) in 2014...

EDIT: Yes, Ronaldo didn’t win CL. You can stop posting new replies saying the same shit now 😊👍"
Whops. Doesn't really change the point of winning a treble and a world cup a year later and still not any german player getting anywhere close to it
"I clearly stated have done, meaning ronaldo hasnt done anything thus far to even merit being in the triumvirate of nominees this year. Of course he could turn up in the closing stages of the ucl and win their third in a row but as of now he shouldnt even be in the discussion.

Who in Germany's team was a real contender for the balon D'or? Messi reached the finals too.

2010:

Arguably a lot of people wanted Iniesta to win it and imo he was up there so you do have a point. I guess it's the goalscorer bias in ballon d'or. 

All of the 3 contesters for the Ballon D'or this year are all goalscorers though.

"
"> Explain 2010, 2014

team efforts... 

those are great teams without superstars, I think Iniesta was injured that year and played very bad till the last part..."
Voting system was different back then.

"I agree with you, I think that Argentina is a very strong team, they have many great players and they have the best forwards in the world, Brazil has been a favourite and has qualified in the first place of CONMEBOL since the 2006 World Cup, and they have disappointed every time since then!"
If Varane could mark Hummels correctly they might have won it all last time. 
Sneijder wasn’t even our best player that WC. 
Is it? Messi and Ronaldo have been largely deserving of each of the awards they won. We just happen to be watching in an era dominated by two all-time greats.

I would say he won it more due to him having an insane CL campaign than “his team won trophies so he won”."
"Yes, but what I am saying is that any fan (or player) would rather the CL or league trophy instead of the ballon d'or, if they had to choose between them."

"Ronaldo never won the CL ever, he joined Madrid after they won the CL. "
Problem is that Ronaldo and Messi skew the data by being obviously the best two players in the world for the last 10 years
Real only bought Ronaldo after he won the World Cup.
"> Ronaldo won in 2002 but he also won the the Champions League that year with Real Madrid.

Ronaldo won it exclusively for his performance at the World Cup. He barely played in 2002 for Inter due to injury (only 10 league games, 16 in total), and was injured again after the Cup, delaying his debut for RM until the 6th of October 2002."
"> Messi won ahead of WC winners Iniesta and Xavi in 2010 (without winning the CL either), and Ronaldo (CL winner) ahead of Messi and Neuer (WC finalists) in 2014...

That's because FIFA and France Football merged both awards. Get your facts straight, mate."

>Messi won ahead of WC winners Iniesta and Xavi in 2010 (without winning the CL either), and Ronaldo (CL winner) ahead of Messi and Neuer (WC finalists) in 2014...

but those are Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and the winners were team teams where in fact iniesta and xavi divided votes. We shall see anyway, but do not count on the champions league to be more important than the world cup. it is not."
"Well Ribery was pretty close in 2013 (not german, but played for the treble winning club) "
"Both Ribery and Neuer were close. Nothing is enough, Neymar will have to wait especially since he isn't winning a WC in Europe."
"In 2017/18, he has 28 goals and 5 assists in 31 games. He is definitely not out of the discussion, though I agree that he is not in top 3 right now."
Always this talk but still no trophies for another year. Kane will leave and Spurs will still have 0 trophies to show
Psg has a better looking future than Tottenham what are you on about.
"Im not him lol, it's just funny to see the hate he gets here. '' Mbappes shadow '' lmao, the things i read here.

It is... but Madrid doesn't exactly sit in well and have given up leads all season
"But then if Madrid stays low we'll get chances. If you really think about it, we win every time whatever we do"
"yes you're right, re-read his quote and it's more of an assumption. either way, optimistic though"
"Well, it's settled then."
YES
Hit the post near the end of the same game
And I responded with a sarcastic tone...I think you need to lighten up
"I am afraid but I will close the argument here since I don't want to go in a petty fight, but as I said before all I care is watching my team play and get the good vibe. Maybe we are not the best team unless we don't win the league but thats just a subjective argument that you are more than welcome to assert although I don't follow it. :)"
Is than an Indian Sylvester Stallone?
Yo that guy was in training day and he played a Mexican guy lol. That shit was so dumb.
Mother of God...
To me he looks a bit like [Jamel Debbouze](http://img.bfmtv.com/c/1000/600/33c/4872b027c777f237209610acab31e.jpeg)
I remember real madrid against Pep's Barcelona.
"I’d sit here and argue that but then I’ve realized it won’t matter in 5 minutes considering you created your account solely to piss on Madrid and Ronaldo 

If your hate for a rival overcomes your love for your team then maybe you should take up another hobby man. It’s not healthy to be mad all the time "
Fwiw I saw a recent interview with Thiago Silva where it appeared he was happy to share game time with Kimpembe and enjoyed using his experience to help teach the youngster. 
In the context that he cried it does
"Neuer had an unbelievable year, but I guess a goalkeeper was never going to win it.

In 2010 either Iniesta or Sneijder could (should?) have won it. Sneijder had the treble and went to the World Cup final.

I think Neymar would have to put PSG and Brazil on his back and carry them to the finals of the Champions League and World Cup to have a chance because his league form will not count as much as Messi or Ronaldo's. If PSG goes out against Madrid, I'd say it severely hurts his chances of winning."
"I think it was correct, Iniesta was great in general but not that year, he just happened to be in the best team at WC and score in the final but overall he didnt even remotely played his best year"
How was Forlan not even in the final 3 in 2010 though? IIRC he was the best player of the World cup AND he made athletico wins the Europa League in this single year.
"Also not to mention Ronaldo won the 2013 Ballon D'or without any trophy that year, so the Ballon D'or isn't really ...consistent in that matter."
Wasn't it Sneijder in 2010? I think most people prefered him over Iniesta that year.
I mean if Brazil wins it this year it’d be a team effort. That team is loaded at all positions except perhaps center backs depending how Thiago Silva and co. Perform. It’s not as complete as 2010 Spain or 2014 Germany but it’s not just a 1 man team. Not that you were implying that but my point is I don’t see the award not going to Messi or Ronaldo regardless of WC winner. 
How so? I genuinely don’t know. And how would the different system affect today’s vote?
"hm, its not like robben played bad or anything but sneijder was immense in 2010"
"Yes, but most of the time nominees aren't even playing Metal per se, but hard/alternative rock,  or give it to parody like Tenacious D instead of actual bands like Dream Theater."
"I agree that its subjective to some extent, like i like metal, you can like jazz or blues, but the quality of the music is not subjective"
"Agreed, but i have what i think its the best album of 2018 until now, Arkona - Khram, im sure it won't even be nominated for the Grammy. You should check out, its a really good release."
"Any English football fan worth their salt would have the micky Thomas goal up there even thirty years on. 

And he was not a player anywhere near as are great as Agüero. Folklore is folklore."

"> People seek out stars dude, glorifying players for their individual brilliance is a norm in almost every team sport.

Not sure what this has anything to do with the topic, it's not people's choice who should win Ballon d'Or, plus you can glorify players with just words instead of awards, the entire r/soccer is filled with record breaking posts earlier, only difference is that the latter is more accountable."
"No, I'm acting like if they didn't win the CL he wouldn't have won the award. What happens if Ramos doesn't score in the 93rd minute of the CL final in 2014? Does Ronaldo still win the award that year? "
"I did not say it was more important. I simply said that historically it is arguably as big as the WC in terms of Balon D'Or voting. In fact, the first thing I said was that the WC will of course play a big part."
"Meh, he was third, but still not really any close to surpassing either Messi or CR. "
"In my opinion He would basically have to single handedly carry real to a third ucl trophy to merit even a nomination into the top three. 
But hey stranger things have happened. "
"""Sometimes it’s easy to forget where Spurs were at when Pochettino joined from Southampton – stuck in a state of flux, whipping boys against the top sides under a manager who felt it was a genius move to play Nacer Chadli as a holding midfielder. Pochettino has improved nearly every player at his disposal and turned Kane into one of the top two strikers in world football. He has changed the mentality to the extent that the likes of Keane now feel they should be mentioned in the same breadth as Liverpool even though history suggests otherwise.

Tottenham haven’t won a league title in 57 years and have only two league cups to show for in the past two decades. What Pochettino is doing is altering the entire culture of a club, something which requires stable progress without the petrodollar riches other sides possess.""

"Idk if ""we win every time whatever we do"" is that accurate of a statement seeing as Real are no slouches on the counter themselves. Could end up digging yourselves an even deeper hole in the process. "
deep
Horseshit. The last time Marseille beat PSG was 7 years ago. You didn't need to pry him away from Barca if the French league was your focus. 
"oh yes, that hurts "
"Work on your sarcasm then, hermano."
"Sure, I was just saying than more often than not you need luck to win the CL and not everytime the best team in the world wins it.

For example no one would call Chelsea the best team in the world in 2012 or Liverpool the best team in 2005."
[Mother of God](http://i.imgur.com/vw1xFGx.jpg)
"That was Mourinho though 

I remember last year against Barcelona, leading  the league by a fair margin, a man down with the score at 2-2 with no pressure to win whatsoever and they still went all out attack in the last 10 minutes to win 

Sure that backfired when Messi got the winner but that’s a pretty clear situation of how we’ve progressed since the Mou days"
The only way for a keeper to win it is to have a season like Neuer did and no Messi and Ronaldo.
Sneijder should have won if in 2010 IMO. How you win the treble and lose in extra time in the wc final and not win is crazy to me
"> Sneijder

He got robbed by FIFA in 2010."
Yes he was one of the favourites too. Idk about most people I haven't polled them.
"Between 2010 and 2016 journalists but also captains and managers from 126 countries did vote which turned the vote into a popularity contest. Also players would often vote for the guy playing with them.

Now we're back to the old system where only journalists vote. World cup results and trophies are more valued. (see 1998 with Zidane, 2002 for Ronaldo or 2006 with Cannavaro) "
"Before it was captains and managers, now is journalist, right?"
"At that time the Ballon d'Or was merged with FIFA award and wasn't voted only by journalists, as in tradition."
" I know, he was great, the difference was just so noticeable to me, how teams set up to contain robben, which admittedly let sneijder flourish."
"Please don't corner me in a parking lot chanting ""death to false metal!"" -- I don't even listen to it! Spare me."
"You're getting downvotes but I totally agree. Kendrick, for example, is almost universally considered the best lyricist and storyteller among hip-hop artists. That's why he's the current GOAT of rap. He's more or less objectively better than the rest. "
[deleted]
Yes. 
"It was close if you look at the votes though, unlike Neuer who was 3rd, but wasn't really that close "
"That's a ridiculous opinion. He's only scored 3 goals fewer than Salah and has 6 fewer appearances. If he continues performing at the level he has been (just shy of a goal a game) and leads Real to the CL title, he would certainly merit a nomination. You just clearly hate Ronaldo."
Man. You're taking that guy way too seriously to type all this out. He's  an idiot
Ah. My fault.

Id like a comfirmation from a brazilian. And maybe an explanation lol
It's a joke...
"Calm down it's a joke man. But still, we love beating Marseille."
I get flashback from 2006
"so who would you call the best team in the world for 2012? barcelona or bayern or perhaps real madrid who succumbed under pressure against bayern? If not chelsea who eliminated first 2 of them.

Again most of the times we are biased in nature, and I am not saying that I immune to it because I have said shit which doesn't make sense to promote my narrative when I am acting on antics, and I can conclude you're a barcelona supporter from your comment history so obviously there will be arguments but its not objective for everyone to believe on the same opinion, is it?"
Oh my God. I need a brain scrubber.
Lmao
Cuz he wasn't nearly as good as Messi? Same reason Ribery didn't win in 2013.
LoL cmon dude realistically he wasnt even close to Messi and tbh wasnt even the best player on Inter (Milito)
Thanks for that. It’ll be interesting to see how things land this year if Argentina/Portugal don’t win the WC and there’s a standout player from the winning team. 
"Oh is it? I thought it was still all groups. But perhaps since the balón d’or and fifa player of the year separated again that means balón d’or is just journalists like you said. 

Will be interesting to see if the World Cup is dominated by a top player if the two awards will differ this year. "
"Not saying anything about true/false/posers, but Jethro Thrull is not a metal band, and Tenacious D is not even a real band, even less a quality one."
"Thanks, i don't mind the downvotes, im a musician, i can give you an even better example: If someone tries to play an acoustic guitar without even have tried it before it will probably sound like shit, there are some people that can like it, but doesn't change the fact that this person will not play good"
What do you mean current GOAT? Is he seen as the greatest of all time or is he just the best right now? 
You are incorrect.
"You are basically saying every year Ronaldo should win regardless of team trophies if he has the most goals.

Ah the funny side of the internet."
"Real madrid is the spanish team i support. I dont hate ronaldo but he hasnt been on par with his usual return that he has spoiled us with. 
And out of his goals he has had a few penalty goals this season to inflate his numbers.  "
"Isn't Balon D'or year-based? As in, only 2018 counts. Or am I confusing it with another award? "
Most people don't realize he's scored 10 goals in last few weeks and are just remembering his league form for most of the season. 
"Don't worry, was a copy and paste from an article I just read. Just happened to be a relevant reply. "
"No, they're downvoting you cuz you brang psg in the convo and they weren't talking about that."

And then a picture of him with his sisters.
"Im brazilian, i can confirm. We incest"
"Do you know this guy called Ronaldo Luís Nazário? Well, that guy is brazilian and his taste in hookers is quite particular."
"I would say real madrid since they won the best league in the world and only lost on penalties against Bayern.

I'm a Barcelona supporter but as you can see I admit that Real Madrid was the best team in the world in 2012 even if they didn't win the CL.

Chelsea finished 6th in the Premier League that year and played horribly both against Barca and Bayern, without a massive amount of luck they wouldn't have won the CL.

Chelsea 2009 and Chelsea this year would win against that Chelsea side 90% of the time."
"Bayern fan here. Sneijder in 2010 was way better, and a much bigger factor of his team's success, than Ribery in 2013. He was one of the best players in the Champions League (if not the best), won everything with Inter, and was tied for top scorer in the World Cup, where he was also fantastic. Didn't even make Top 3. "
I think what sneijder did was more impressive. That Barca team was arguably the best team ever and Messi didn't do much at the WC and sneijder was joint top scorer along with almost winning the whole thing. 
"Ehh, I meant to imply that he's the best right now. Whether he's better than some of the older legends like Pac, Biggie, Nas, or even newer guys like Kanye is up for debate. But over the past 5 or 6 years no one has matched his consistent quality across records. "
"He had by far the best stats that year, why couldn’t he have won? 2014 was Messi’s worst ever year as well. "
"""You are incorrect in this fictional scenario that I just made up."""
"Yeah it is year-based, but I was responding to the 'this season'. If we just look at January and February I'm pretty sure Ronaldo will have outscored them both. I can't be bothered to check into it though."
You can have her aswell uncle
"Not really sure I agree Sneijder was better in the CL as a whole. They got the better of Barcelona but Messi had to put the team on his back for both the ro16 and the QF.

To each their own though."
Yeah and sneijder was arguably not the best player on the team for Inter lol. They played the same position and Messi doubled or tripled his g+a iirc. His team achievements were definitely better but he didn't have the same impact as messi.
"Ok cheers, i dont know much about today's hip hop so just wanted more clarity! :) "
Goal count was 61 to 58. Wtf are you talking about?
"They definitely did not play the same position. Regardless, the fact that Sneijder wasn't even in the top 3 that year was insane."
"Eh, for me the barcelona trio were better overall. But you're right Sneijder was much more of a true AM rather than a forward. "
"Quality, Farley's impressions are great and this just tops it off. [There's also one where he meets Benitez and does his impression of him,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBoT1rUsO8s) "
You can see the look of slight hesitation on Carragher's face before he has to start speaking and confirm that the impression was dead on
"Guys been around forever, he’s done this a few times with Liverpool players as well, playing Stevie and some others. 

Here’s one https://youtu.be/QHUzSPrAVhM"

"Darren Farley is quality.

Can’t stop laughing EVERYTIME I watch this one and the Cara impression with Henderson. Spot fucking on. 
"Probably a controversial opinion but I've grown to dislike him recently due to how constant his face is on the telly plugging Ladbrokes.

It's probably more of an issue with betting adverts being showcased so much when I'm watching football, I've experienced the destructive potential of gambling addiction in my family and to see how much it's been normalised and how often it's pushed now is uncomfortable.

I guess I just see it as a shame that so many are willing to sell out for a payday from something that much of the time profits from misery."
Unbelievable Jeff
"""Yeah, of coooooourse"" - Steven Gerrard."
...in this moment...
His Gerrard is fucking top quality. He even had the mannerism of looking anywhere but the camera.
"That was all fucking spot on. 

The Alan Hansen impression at the end was just unreal..."
Lol  thats a giggle from the heart.
It's interesting to see how his impression has evolved in the OP post as Carragher has definitely slowed down his speech a lot as a pundit.
Is that Spencer FC doing the interview?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFrwFSPceZM

Brilliant. Came into the comments to post this exact video if it hadn't been already.

I think you linked wrong buddy 
Hendo was trying soo hard not to laugh. 
Sorry to hear that an addiction affected someone younknow. But the addiction lead them down a path of destruction not the entertainment of gambling. Booze and even food are advertised but affect more people negatively.
