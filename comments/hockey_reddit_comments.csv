"How do I become a ""smarter"" hockey fan. I want to understand how plays develop and how certain plays are executed and are positioned. I also want to have a better understanding about advanced stats. Are there good places to start?"
"Is there a women's equivalent to the NHL the way there is with the NBA and MLS, and do a lot of NHL teams share their arena with such teams? My wife and I are both very excited for a Seattle NHL franchise, but what really made us both excited about the sport was watching women's hockey during the Olympics."
"Does playing in one playoff game burn a year off the ELC? If, for example, Eeli Tolvanen or Jordan Greenway get signed and play a playoff game, they would instantly lose a year off their deals? "
"I know I'm a day late, but when I see trades that involve a prospect. When is a prospect now considered a player? Is it when they play their first game with the NHL team? the first game with the organization, so would AHL count? or is it when a player has completed the first season as a rookie? 

Thank you."

"If a player shoots the puck from behind the blue line and scores, but his teammate was past the blue line and thus offside, does the goal count?"
"Dave has the puck again.

He passes to Bob who passes to Steve. Steve shoots, goalie saves, Bob scores on the rebound. Do Steve and 

EDIT: I have no idea this got posted. Wow. I got distracted mid post and must have hit submit. Apologies. Let's try again.

Do Steve and Dave get assists on the above goal? What if, instead of Steve's shot being saved by the goalie, it hits a defender's leg, before going over to Bob who scores? What level of interference from the other team is required on Steve's shot attempt to nullify Steve and Dave's potential assists?"
Do players need to enter the draft or can they be picked up at any time (as in signing an entry level contract or does that mean something different)?
"In terms of stats, I can recommend [any of these people](https://twitter.com/SteveBurtch/status/967944408912941056) for excellent viz and good analysis (EDIT: Except MannyElk, who is good for pictures of bad salad. Follow corsica instead for his stats). A massive collection of hockey analytics papers can be found [here](http://metahockey.com/) as well.

For a look at some systems, [this](http://blueseatblogs.com/hockey-systems/) is a fairly good resource.

But also, you can teach yourself to an extent. Just watch as many games as possible and try to pick out differences in the way various teams play. For me, the big one is [transition play](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/7g55qr/tenderfoot_tuesday_ask_rhockey_anything_november/dqgvz0h/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=u_goodmorning81). Power play setups are also a pretty easy starting place for this - do they use one defenseman? Two? When they move the puck, are they more north-south or east-west? Do they set up from the point, the wall, or behind the net? A lot of the time, teams will set up their PP units as a platonic ideal of their 5v5 game (ex: Nashville likes to run their PP up to the points, getting a lot of offense from their defensemen; similarly, they like to have their defensemen spark the offense at 5v5 as well)."
"If you’re okay with spending a few bucks, The Athletic is an awesome news source. They don’t do many lineups/highlight pieces or gameday info, it’s more in depth analysis of rosters, certain players, team strategy, and advanced stats. And I’m almost certainly they have a guy dedicated to the Habs. "
"As for the first part of your question, there's two ways to learn the game and how it's played on a large and smaller level. One is by just watching games, looking for patterns, and always asking yourself why would X player skate that way, not take the shot at that point, chose to dump the puck there, commit to the shooter instead of the passer on the rush, etc. Second is to step out onto the ice and play the game. While it's not going to be full speed NHL,  it still gives you a sense of the space of the ice, how much time players have with the puck, and the perspective of the players compared to the all-seeing perspective of a TV broadcast"

no, they do not share arenas because women's hockey does not draw enough in ticket sales to justify renting an arena with 18,000+ capacity"
"The contract is only eligible to slide if a player is 18 or 19 as of September 15 in the year that he signs.

I don't believe either Greenway or Tolvanen have signed ELCs, so Greenway, who is 21, would burn a year off his ELC by playing in a single game. Tolvanen, who turns 19 in April, would be eligible to have his ELC slide by a year if he played fewer than 10 games (including playoffs) with Nashville.

The one exception to this rule is that a player who signs his ELC when he's 19, but who turns 20 between September 16 and December 31 of his signing year, isn't eligible to have his contract slide, which is why Charlie McAvoy burned a year off of his ELC by playing for Boston last season in the playoffs despite signing as a 19 year-old and appearing in fewer than 10 games.

**Edit:** Meant fewer than 10 games for Tolvanen, not fewer than 9."
"Playing more than 9 games, playoff games included, will burn a year off ELC"
"The definition of a ""prospect"" is somewhat fluid. It usually refers to a player who has yet to establish a spot on the NHL team. That could mean that he played a few NHL games, but was not consistently in the lineup. Or that he's still playing in the AHL, ECHL, juniors, Europe, etc."

"No, that would not count.

See Dominik Hasek [have some fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_c_7l1vjtM) with the rule.

There was also a goal in a Rangers-Flyers game from a few years ago that was disallowed because (I think) Stepan dumped the puck in on Mason, but Kreider (again, I think) was off-side when the puck entered the zone, so it didn't count."
"Steve and Dave should get assists, as the other team didn't control the puck. I believe it's supposed to be controlling the puck, ie. attempting to clear, pass, or handle the puck."
"[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/6jyxnx/any_crash_courses_on_drafts_stats_and_positions/djidirb/) a rundown on some slightly more general draft stuff. I think most of your questions are answered there.

The only thing I would add to that is that teams have 4 years from the time when they draft a player to sign him to an ELC (if he doesn't re-declare). If they don't sign him, he's a free agent, and can sign with any team he wants. (Example: Jimmy Vesey.)

Also, anyone older than the age cutoff who never got drafted can be signed at any time.

But let me know if I wasn't clear enough."
"Thank you, I got it."
Would a definition be someone who can be sent to AHL without having to pass waivers?
"You sure? I always thought when the goalie makes a save, leg or blocker, it nullifies the play. His blocking doesn't count as a pass, which would create the assists on the score sheet. "
"Actually teams only have two years to sign a player. The 4 year rule is an exception for NCAA players, since it takes 4 years to finish college. "
"That helped a lot, thanks!"
You're welcome
"Not necessarily. There are a number of players that can be sent to the AHL without needing to pass through waivers, yet have secured a regular spot in the lineup of their NHL team.

For example, Patrik Laine is still on his ELC and can be sent to the AHL without having to pass through waivers (when he plays his 160th NHL game, he will no longer be waivers exempt). But he has played 139 NHL games and has secured a regular spot in the Jets' lineup. Most people would no longer consider him a prospect."
"No, rebounds count. For example, last night [Killorn scored](https://www.nhl.com/video/killorns-rebound-goal/t-294009006/c-58495703) off a Stamkos rebound. [The goal](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/fla-vs-tbl/2018/03/06/2017021024#game=2017021024,game_state=final) is listed as Killorn-Stamkos-Kucherov."
"Yes, that.

I think I mentioned the two years thing in the linked comment, but I should have been clearer."
That explanation helps. Thanks!
TIL. Playin hockey for 15 years and I always thought a rebound nullified the assists if it was off the goalie. 
You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.
"Would you be down to lend your nickname to John ""The Mayor"" Mayer?"
"I know when they say ""skating on his own"" they mean ""skating but not in practice"" but everytime I see that phrase I think it sounds like the player was previously skating with help. Like they drag the injured players out on the ice and skate them around until they recover enough to go it alone again."
Do I need to say what all of us Devils fans are thinking?
"Marchand is an incredible hockey player. Like seriously so good (yes, Bruins fans, I'd want him on my team solely based on the points he puts up).

It makes his bad decisions even more head-scratchingly stupid.

Edit: glad to hear that MoJo is improving!!!"
I'm glad he has. I just feel awful about the whole thing. 
FBM
Dude just started skating again and the rat was only suspended 5 games. FUCK YOU MARCHAND!
A little confused by the 'on his own' part 
POS should have gotten more than 5 games 
So you could say he is...... getting his Mojo back?
"I seriously want to like marchand, I mean the guy is mean, extremely skillful and he really plays the part of the villain. But these moronic attempts to injure just makes me hate him. "
Mr. Mojo Risin'
"Great to hear, hope his recovering keeps progressing "

"I like him back for playoffs, but I also don't want to kill him."
"Stick taps to Johansson, nose whacks to Marchand."
Fuck Marchand's behavior. 
"As a Bruins fan, this really puts things into perspective. We all think of Marchand as a ""great and charismatic player who can be a bit dirty at times."" Maybe we need to stop sugar coating it?

I love Marchand as a player, but honestly, he should have been suspended for at least as long as Johansson is out. "
What are we going to do all these forwards?
"concussions suck but a pens fan here really irked by the ""finally"" after seeing sid miss a calendar year."
Fuck Marchard
New rule: If you intentionally injure someone to the point they are out for a significant amount of time then you are suspended for that amount of time.  Again. FUCK YOU MARCHAND.  
"Skill or no skill, I wish the NHL had a ""banned for life"" category so shit heels like Marchand could see how close he's getting to ending his own career through his reckless and dangerous behavior. "

Time to get our MOJO back!
Glad to hear good news for MoJo. God Marchand would be so respected if he was a clean player
"scumbag rat face should have been suspended as long as johansson couldnt play, totally deliberate move by rat face. he should be more sensitive, especially considering savard's career was ruined by a shit bag who took runs at people."
"I hope Brad Marchand gets into a freak accident and he has to retire from hockey.

Better yet, I just hope Wilson scraps him, one punch KOs Marchand and Marchand has to take the rest of the year off because the concussion was so bad.

IDGAF about how much talent he has.

He's a dirty fucking rat and a living humanoid form of scum."
"If I hear one more person say ""I love the way he plays but..."" I'm going to fucking pop. Grow up and stop qualifying your criticism of this piece of shit. He doesn't deserve to be in the league."
I'm positive the conversation in here will only be about how happy people are that he's skating again.
"DOPS should just put Dustin Brown and Brad Marchand in a rink together for some 1-on-1 hockey until a series of unfortunate hockey plays puts them both on the LTIR for a while.

We can have Matt Cooke officiate."
"When a reckless play injures a player, that player that performed the hit should be required to sit out as long as the other player is injured.

MoJo missed half the season, therefore Marchand should miss half the season. Period."
"A repeat offended like Marchand should have to sit out until the the injured player returns, and THEN serve his 5 game suspension. It irks me that Marchand is back after 5 games making a big splash for Boston, while the impact player he injured on an intentional, dirty play is still out. "
"I adore that the Bruins wanted Matt Cooke drawn and quartered but Marchand is ok because he's a high-skill player, too. "
"so this thread, being posted about the same time as the one where Marchand scores a hatty and becomes the bruins all time OT goal scorer ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/82kzyr/marchand_gets_the_hat_trick_and_becomes_the_all/)) has got me thinking.

as a general rule of thumb, i despise the penalties where the result helps determine the punishment (for example, the rule where any blood from a highstick makes it a double minor).  my life-long belief, and the way i have always officiated (25 years), is that the player's action should determine the punishment, not the result.  just because a player falls down does not mean someone has committed a penalty.  likewise, just because a player gets hurt, does not mean that a penalty was committed.

the question i have is what to do about player (in this case Marchand) who have absolutely no regard for the health and welfare of other players.  should he, as a repeat offender, be allowed to injure multiple players and yet come back to score important goals and help his team in the standings, while the player he so recklessly injured remains out (and thus unable to help his team in the standings) due to the actions of the offender?  

should there, instead, be some mechanism by which a player who commits a violation so egregious as to warrant a suspension by the office of players safety have their suspension pegged to the time missed by the injured player?  

i would not advocate that this apply to ""regular"" penalties, merely those that already rise to the level of earning a suspension from the league.  (in fact, i am not sure i am advocating for this course of action at all, just throwing it out there for discussion). 

i dont know what the answer is, but just seeing these stories posted so close together gave me pause and got me to thinking...

"
"Next time, he'll keep his head away from Marchy's elbow region. "
Marchand's suspension should have been tied to how long Johansson has been out.
Thank you. I genuinely thought he was so messed up he needed assistance for all tasks.
When healthy how has Johansson been for you

"If anything, it makes it worse. He doesn't *need* to do that stupid shit to be an incredibly effective player.

As is, fuck Brad Marchand."
You can have him
"You get downvoted for being glad he’s skating again and saying you feel bad it happened to him, just because you’re a bruins fan. Bruins fans can’t control how Marchand acts, and while there are some who will defend him, there’s many who realize what he did was absolutely shitty. "

"I have advocated for that in the past but the problem with it goes both ways, first, freak injury against a guy at the end of his career. If he just refused to formally retire are you suspended forever? Second what if you make a dirty hit and the guy doesn't get hurt, no suspension?"
"Usually means by himself, or not skating with the team in practice "

You leave Jimmy out of this
Wouldn't that mean he gave your mom the clap.
"It probably does already, lol "
"It's just a terrible precedent to set. The NHL needs to simply use context more often and have a specific set of guidelines for repeat offenses, what they are, how much time between incidents qualifies it as a repeat, etc. 

If they already have that they do a shit job enforcing it and I don't see why people blame Marchand for not learning his lesson if the league is clearly showing him it's ok. At work if I'm cutting corners on projects/daily load and my manager knows, and doesn't tell me it's wrong, I'm probably going to keep cutting corners.

Now personally, if I was Marchand I'd probably play less physically. I stepped on a guy in indoor soccer last week on pure accident and felt like a fucking murderer. But the NHL is as responsible for drawing lines in the sand as much as Marchand is for upholding clean play. "
"A full season suspension shouldn't have been out of the question. There have been so many already, and this one was particularly foul."
"We could always take him back?

Please?"
Send them all out to collectively fuck Brad Marchand.
Both are massive dickwads. 
"Yeah, no reason for people to comment on what could have caused him to only be skating now, no reason at all...



Fuck Marchand "
except there are plenty of terrible attempts to injure that end up doing nothing at all and thankfully the other person is fine so this kind of eye for an eye system wouldn't work in reality
"> sit out until the injured player returns

You have to lack the capacity for critical thought to think is even a halfway decent idea. WAY too easy to game."
He totally head butted his elbow. That's why Marchand was suspended. Don't be a moron. 
... the classlessness of this. 
I understand that sentiment but that's too easily abusable.
He was solid. Not putting up the most points but his zone entry was great and we needed that
"He was good, pretty much on par for putting the same amount of points up as previous seasons with the Caps. "
"http://www.hockeybuzz.com/blog.php?post_id=90623


Apparently pretty dang good. Not god-tier, but solid, which is why we got him. We needed solid production and responsible play on the wing. "
How is there not a bot for this yet
He should be banned from the sport just for having that face.

You know what else is a broken record? Brad Marchand playing like a dirty asshole.

"> charity wise

Hard to judge these guys by that stuff anymore. Any sport. It's almost just part of the job and a PR thing at this point. Which at least still benefits a lot of people. But a ton of these guys (even the guys with the biggest hearts) wouldn't have ever even thought to go out of their way to participate in charity. Especially with the nutso schedules they run from Sep-April (and beyond).

I'd wouldn't be surprised if Marcharnd is only a ""good guy"" when it benefits Marchand in some way."
"Also bruins fans can still be fans of the Bruins, but not fans of Marchand's shitty antics"

How many games has Johansson missed?
"> how harmful a suspension is to a player

Marchand never learns though. He really needs to get the message loud and clear next time, so maybe 20, 25 games would do it. If he does something really bad I mean. "
"I'm a Bruins fan.

> People really underestimate how harmful a suspension is to a player, he was essentially fined $400,000.

You underestimate how harmful a concussion is to a player.

> I expect all the downvotes regardless becuase I'm a Bruins fan posting in /r/hockey.

Yes. But also, your opinion is bad. 

"
"5 games is not a lot. It's roughly 6% of the season. To make a comparison with the SHL, which is what I'm most familiar with, there are currently two active 5-game suspensions. That's roughly 10% of the season.

I feel like getting upwards of 10% of the season is very reasonable considering this is what? His 8th or 9th instance of supplemental discipline? He's got a well documented history of intentionally trying to injure other players. With that in mind 5 games is nothing."
">he was essentially fined $400,000.

And Marcus got a 2nd brain injury... And injury that get a progressively more dangerous the more times you get them. So is fair really the right term?

"
"You’ll get downvoted because it wasn’t fair. With Marchand’s history that should have been a lot more. Blatant attempt to injure a guy, and he succeeded possibly ending their career. Hell compare his history to Torres’ and look at the suspension lengths. Only reason Marchand got 5 and no more is because he puts points on the board. "
"How many games has Johansen missed? 

If 5 games is harmful, how harmful is 2-3 months? Logic."
"Bruins fan posting in /r/hockey in a Marchand thread no less, what're you a Massholechist?"
">he was essentially fined $400,000

No. He had to forego salary of 5 games in which he could not play. This is uncompensated time off.

There was no fine.

Fair would have been an in-person hearing to determine a suspension commensurate with and proportional to the harm."
"> I expect all the downvotes regardless because I'm a Bruins fan 

People are downvoting you because you are making Marchand seem like the victim. Your flair could say anything..."
"Except that tons of other Bruins fans here are getting upvoted.

Maybe, maybe, possibility, people just disagree with your opinion on this issue? I dunno. "

"One bites fingers, the other bites skateblades"
I never once doubted this subreddits ability to jerk each other off about how much they hate Marchand. 
"does it have to be one or the other?  could it not be that a player is suspended for his actions for a suitable length of time, or for however long the player he hurt is out, whichever is longer?

so a player (let's just say Marchand) elbows a player in a violent manner (Johansson, for example) and Johansson is not hurt.  the suspension would be 5 games (the suspension which i believe was actually meted out) -or- in the case where Johansson is hurt, as long as he is out?

again, i would only advocate the for repeat offenders.  for cases like above where a player (again, Marchand, in this case) repeatedly displays his complete disregard for the welfare of his fellow players.  Raffi Torres (a former bluejacket, whom i quite liked) could also fit in that category."
"Too easy to game? As in you think people are going to sit out longer to keep the player that injured them out? Is it applicable in any situations? Isn't discretion already used by DOPS, why can't this be a harsh sentence for a repeat offended or egregious offense? Maybe to bring up the idea that a player who ends someone's career egregiously Bertuzzi style should also have their career ended?

Sorry if exploring new ideas rather than tossing them in the trash cause you think it couldn't work violates your definition of critical thought, by the way."
"there is that possibility, but the suspension should only apply if the player in question commits an action which would already rise to the level of earning a suspension.  if Marchand didnt want to get suspended, then he shouldnt launch himself sideways at another players head, elbow first.  the action would have to be suspendable *before* this could apply.  i dont know how Johansson would game Marchand to commit that action (once Marchand does, it would certainly be easy enough to game how long a player was out, that much i agree with).

again, i am not 100% sure this is a good idea, but i am not sure having Marchand meaningfully contribute to the Bruins march to the playoffs (and setting all time Bruins records in the process) while the player he intentionally hurt (and was suspended for doing do) is still out is particularly defendable either..."
God do we miss his zone entry.
I did the math a couple months ago to shut up some kid who said he’s useless. If playing all the games up to now judging by his point total from the ones hes played he’d be easily above 30 possible 40 depending on consistency. Not the 50 point guy we hoped but he’s been injured and hasn’t had time to heat up plus concussions suck . #fuckbradmarchand

I've seen multiple times the phrase ""trying to give a concussion"" used in the conversation, and I just am not buying it. "
"Fully agree, they act like having a Bruins flair or being a fan instantly makes you happy with how Marchand acts on occasion. Most of us are pretty vocally against him doing stupid shit"

Shut the fuck up you’re at like 150 upvotes. Is it hard playing the victim like this when Boston fans literally have nothing to complain about
"Well, Marchand did apologize. To his own team.

Bruins’ Brad Marchand on suspension: [‘I let my teammates down’](http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/bruins/2018/01/bruins_brad_marchand_on_suspension_i_let_my_teammates_down)"
He's a coward for deleting his post too. 
"Yeah this kid is being a prick, meanwhile, everyone else wishing Mojo the best. and all the while Marchy  setting records."
"I don't wish Marchand any injury, I just wish that when he does do something like this again (and he will.) they sit his ass for the rest of the season. Don't care how skilled you are when your on-ice antics could end someone else's career. "
"Free Bacon, Man."
How many cubits?
I think he was saying in general. Like a Matt Cooke incident. 
"What the other guy said, more general issues with a scheme of suspending a guy for as long as the guy he hit is out. Or a situation where a player on a team that's been eliminated who could come back for the last couple of games if they were competitors but they just keep him out because there's nothing to play for. Does the offender then get held out for the whole playoffs?"
"Downvoted just for ~~continuing the discussion~~ flair.


FTFY"
I'm speaking generally about a scheme of suspending for the duration of injury. Please work on your reading comprehension.
So would you say that Hunwick should be suspended forever? Everyone forgets that Savvy came back and got another concussion that ended his career.
"We did earlier this season, and we put him in as goalie."
"No, it is Patrick"
"Lol I got a laugh out of typing it, I wonder how many people just didn't get it."
20 games. He's been out for 20 games
"A while back in one of these threads, someone suggested making the suspensions last as long as the injured player is out, where applicable. That's probably a system that'd be ripe for abuse, but damn if it ain't appealing."
Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind my friend. 
"How many games did Savard miss? And Cooke got nothing.

How many games did Eriksson miss? Scott got 6 and Orpik got nothing.

How many games did Bergeron miss? Randy Jones got nothing.

If it wasn't the last 4 games of the season, how many games would Horton have missed considering he was only fit for travel a week or so after he got hit? Rome got 4 games

How many games did Carlo get at the end of last year? Ovi got nothing

How many games did McQuaid miss? Beagle got off scotch free.

How many games did Krejci miss? Wideman's only punishment was a punch to the face

I could go on. In just about every case like that, the player who is hurt loses more games than the player who commits the act. You could make lists like that for every team and that was just the dirty hits"
"Gudas' suspensions get longer and longer every time for a reason. Another example: Raffi Torres. 

How this rat fuck has dodged the same treatment is beyond all of us."
"Every time a player sets foot on the playing surface of their sport they risk getting injured. Whether a non-contact lower body injury, or  a stray puck to the head/face, or a bad hit in this case. 

They assume the risk for the money and the passion, or whatever reason they play the sport. In no way does that mean I think people should be dishing out hits to the head, or injuring players as a part of the game. But injuries are a part of the game, accountability/intent can be debated, but it usually isn't a factor in punishment in any sport.

The league suspended him for making that type of hit, that's how they view it. They should probably figure out some newer/updated procedures but in this case the suspension was consistent."
1 month and 1 week. He also doesn't lose any salary.
"Pretty sure the money from the salary loss goes to an NHL fund for a charity or something.

Either way, whatever way you slice it, Marchand lost money which is what happens whether you get fined or get your pay cut for X amount of time. "
How am I doing that. I'm saying he made a dirty hit and was fairly punished for it. Nowhere in anything I said did I imply he's a victim
"This whole thing is his fucking fault. He is quite literally the reason Johansson has been out for 6 weeks, and is just starting to skate again.

 You Bruins fans with this goddamn persecution complex look like such assholes.

If seeing people disparaging your favorite player is going to make you cry, stay out of threads discussing injuries that shitstain caused. "
"If you want to argue that Marchand's suspension was too short, groovy. If you want to tie suspension length to time missed by the victim, then I say again you aren't much of a thinker."
"What is this ""zone entry""? Is it that thing where you try to skate through three defenders by yourself while crossing the blue line and immediately turn it over?

Because I'll have you know we're doing fine at that, thank you."
Mojo is never going to be a key piece of your offense. He's nothing more than a complementary piece; he just doesn't have the strength or consistency to drive an offense. But holy shit is he a master at getting the puck into the zone and beginning the cycle.
"He definitely should have more points. He was put with Zajac for a good amount of time who was basically a black hole for offense when returning from injury. He simply had no real offensive support on his line so it wasn’t easy for him. Putting Zajac into the 3C shutdown role now with guys who can dictate the pace has really helped him recover.

Now that Zacha has taken the 2C role, it allows MoJo to take the 2LW role eventually and play with a much more creative player. *IF* he comes back, I could see him and Pavel do well together with Palmieri. 

It’s just tough to know if he’ll really come back this season. We have the depth to handle his absence but damn we could use him as well."
Brad Marchand is E L I T E
That's why I said except when he's on Team Canada. As far as I've seen he doesn't do that stuff in international play. He's just a good player there.
"For real man, I can't believe all these pussies want to remove brain injuries from the sport

Edit:

I can't believe I have to clarify that this was a joke. "
"The ole ""cut off the nose to spite your face"" argument. "
Im fine with Canada losing anytime. With or without Marchand. 
You act like there aren’t plenty of philly fans who have celebrated or acted oblivious about dirty hits by their own team’s players.  This one comment tipped the scales for ya?

A lot also don't like him in general despite his skill, and some love how he plays. When I ordered my Marchand jersey at the end of last season (before his spear on Dotchin), the ONE thing I said was that I would cancel the order if he did any dirty shit before the playoffs. Next night, he fucking spears Dotchin and I was pissed.

Tried to cancel the order but found out I couldn't (after 24h, already shipped). If there's one good thing to come of it, at least the hate here in Vancouver is worth it; it fuels me :P"
"It's not just the Bruins, its most big teams on here. Penguins, Leafs, Oilers, and Hawks fans get attacked too but not as bad as us. It's like unless you have a Preds, BJ's or Knights flair, everyone downvotes opinions that are normal. "

Jealousy + controversy = karma

They hated Marchand prior to his ""reputation"" but ignored Crosby/Hornquist/Malkin antics because of purely perception/image. 

There's just as many nut shots and slashes to the finger from those three as there are Marchand incidents. I also don't hear anyone talking about the Hornquist hit on The Stallion, or the retaliation by Kessel/Malkin for a completely clean hit on Hornquist from the game last week the way they KNOW FOR A FACT Marchand INTENTIONALLY injures people. 

Whattayagunna do everyone from Boston is a racist Marchand enabler and we all deserve to be downvoted for trying to participate in the conversation. "
Boston fans are never welcomed anywhere. But It feels good we are consistent winners or contending. 
I mean we lost the SB to Philly this year on an epic defensive collapse. Are we not allowed to complain about that? 
"Did he even visit Johansson?

Edit: When I say ""visit"" Johansson I mean say hey I'm sorry I fucked up etc"

Marchand should be suspended until Johansson comes back.
"Fuck Billy Madison

"your whataboutism is really disgusting. Just because they've got it wrong countless times before, doesn't mean they can't or shouldn't or won't strive to get it right moving forward."
"It doesn't make it any more just. This just means the league is a joke when it comes to protecting it's own players and punishing those that intentionally injure others.

It's really sad that someone is going to have to either die or be paralyzed for life before they take this shit seriously "
lol okay so just cuz Cooke ended Savard's career and didn't get suspended makes Marchand throwing elbows and not getting more games okay. Gotcha
None of those guys have gotten suspensions/fines for 9 straight fucking seasons. He is way beyond a repeat offender. He deserved way more than 5; plain and simple.
I've always observed that the Department of Player safety tends to go very easy on Boston. There must be a close affinity between the league and the Bruins organization.
"Theoretically he can be losing significant salary in the form of lower future contracts due to injuries impacting the quality of his play. Not to mention the reality that GMs look at injury history as a factor in establishing demand for a player.

The 2018/2019 season is the last one on the books for his current contract. If that season is in any way impacted by this injury, this injury will have a significant impact on his salary."
"> but 5 games is a lot. People really underestimate how harmful a suspension is to a player, he was essentially fined $400,000.

"
It's a persecution complex when I point how much someone else is crying?
We'd also like to learn about this. We've heard rumors that you can attack without dumping it before the blue line but I think it's a myth
I understand this but in honesty like stated above he was placed on a line going nowhere originally. He needs a line where someone else can drive offense and he can set them up or start it off. He seems like a primary secondary assist kind of guy with the occasional goal

"I pointed out that players don't get punished even close to the amount of time that the injured player missed. But this is the Bruins and Marchand to fuck them, execution is good.

That's not what he said at all. He's giving examples of major injuries that were just as bad OR WORSE than your player's injury while pointing out that no one called for the type of punishment the OP above is calling for.

Ovi has had some seriously brutal hits in his career and gotten a couple of suspensions and escaped a few others due to his status. Beagle is relatively clean admittedly, that was a black mark on a relatively good career. Wideman again, has only really had a season and blew a player's knee out on a shit hit that I know of. If Marchand deserved 5, Ovi shouldn't have been back until some point in the playoffs and Cooke should have been kicked from the league. They didn't and Marchand didn't "

"It’s because along with having a bigger fan base comes more vocal douchebags.

"Honestly, using Taylor Hall is not a fair comparison. He doesn't have a history of intentionally injuring players, like Marchand has. If you were to say Miles Wood (a player who has been suspended for intentionally hurting someone) went and lumberjack slashed another player in the knee. Then yes, absolutely suspend him for as long as the opposing player is injured. 

Don't defend Marchand just because he is a good player. Someone could be killed one day by antics like his. All it's gonna take is to hit someone in the right spot.

"If Taylor Hall or any Devil for that matter made an intentional dirty hit you bet your ass I’d want them suspended for it and I’d accept any punishment given.

"I'm not defending Marchand, he made a shit hit and paid the price once for it with the suspension and a Devil should have made him pay more by fighting him rather than going for the big hit and letting him talk trash about assisting on the empty netter. You are right, and as I mentioned below, Boston has had a pretty large group of those players get carried off on stretchers and the league sat by and watched. Hall plays physical and has crossed the line in the past, he is a star in the league, I think he is the perfect choice of a comparison, not some second year bender like Wood

Example from a month ago that could have resulted in a suspension (https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/taylor-hall-fined-explosive-boarding-hit-kyle-okposo/) "
I think Taylor Hall is a perfect comparison because they bring equivalent offensive production in theory. They're both highlight offensive players that if out of the lineup drastically change their team's capabilities. 
Maybe he should have maybe he shouldn't have. John Scott took Eriksson's head off and fucked his entire season up- he got 6 games despite having history and the DOPS knowing he only has one role in the NHL. Keep punishments consistent. The only punishment from them that I can think of recently that got more than Marchand was Nyquist and Wideman's incidents. One of which was physically assaulting a ref and the other was maliciously spearing someone in the face which a tad worse than Marchand chicken winging 
"I'm emphasizing how a 5 game suspension actually affects players a lot and isn't just something they can shrug off. Yea he ended up with a relatively serious concussion, but there was no way of knowing that at the time. He could've returned in a week. Marchand in return got a $400,000 fine which is money 95% of people here won't see in 5-10 years."

"At this point, using 2nd round references against a Caps fan in a way that isn't a (preferably amusing) joke and has nothing to do with the playoffs is basically [Ryan Johansen](https://streamable.com/391vb) level chirping

If a Caps fan mocks one of your player's regular season achievements, and you come back with ""you still haven't made it out of the second round"", no one is gonna think ""oh he really showed him"" or ""damn, the Caps really haven't made it out of the second round?"" 

I have no problem with trash talk and in this case the other poster was being an ass, but try to be at least a little creative. Even a simple ""about as prestigious as getting past the second round"" or ""it's closer to prestigious than you are to the third round"" would've been an improvement"
"Eh don't waste your breathe too much you were very clear in your initial comment giving injury examples. The clear message was ""if these just as serious injuries (some worse) didn't warrant rule changes, why now""; and the answer is because /r/hockey hates Marchand.

I don't think a single media outlet, analyst, player, or anyone for that matter outside of this sub would think suspending people for the length of the injury is effective. "
"See the problem is though, if a Devil were to go and wail on Marchand that's a penalty, possibly even a major and a game misconduct, as well as a possible suspension. That isn't just, and equal compensation is what everyone wants.

And yes, Hall plays physical and in that video if the play was dead and he did that, absolutely he should be gone and suspended. He doesn't go around clocking guys in the side of the head with his elbow for no reason at all and while the play is dead, like Marchand. 

"
"Brad Marchand does not carry the Bruins though. Is he a key cog in their machine? Yes, but so is Wood for the Devils. That's why, along with having a suspension history, I found him to be a more suitable example."
"> Marchand chicken winging

lmfao he gave the man a concussion and he's missed 20 games and you're calling it chicken winging. 

And you're right, they should be more consistent in giving out bigger suspensions "
">I'm emphasizing how a 5 game suspension actually affects players a lot and isn't just something they can shrug off. 

In the context of what happened it absolutely is something one should just shrug off. Which is why I'm trying to explain to you how you're painting him as a victim. The fact that you show any kind of empathy at all for him is asinine. The fact that you think him losing 400,00 dollars is something anyone should give a shit about is asinine. He permanently damaged someone's brain and you are saying him losing some money isn't something we should just shrug off?

lol"
Is that the general consensus in Philly? 
"People probably shouldn't clutter threads with ""Fuck Marchand what a loser"" either, because that's just as much a shitty contribution but you'll probably circle jerk upvote it when you see it right? 

Be the change you want to see in the world junior."
Pretty sure having Orr with all the open ice at 3v3 would be considered cheating.  Especially considering how slow skaters were in the 1970s
"What? Chicken winging implies it was a dirty elbow, that's what the term is..."
"Yeah chicken wing, throwing an elbow out. That is what a chicken wing is. 

Okay then, as long as you are okay with being the first be my guest. I don't want to see bigger suspensions until other teams are bent by them first "
"Do you realize how often that happens and how rarely it ever gets punished? You're naive as fuck if you think even 5% of professional athletes, in the NHL/NFL at least, haven't already suffered permanent brain damage. Marchand got the book throw at him compared to anyone else, and I'm saying he deserved what he got."
"Comments like this are why I click ""continue this thread"""
"You wouldn't get it, ""sarcasm"" isn't a spelling word until 5th grade."
Chicken wing makes it sound weak
Thats fine. If one of our guys throws a nasty elbow out and is a repeat offender im more than okay with seeing him get more than 5 games. Dont play like a dirt bag
"> Marchand got the book throw at him

And you sit here and actually question how you are painting him as a victim lol

He didn't get anything thrown at him. lol

The guy has a history of trash like this and got 5 games. But go ahead, keep defending him and acting confused as to how you're painting him as a victim even though every single word your utter in regards to him is painting him as a victim. 

The guy has been in the league 7 year and has 6 suspensions all doing dirty shit. Not to mention all the dirty shit he didn't get suspended for. And you are sitting here saying he got the book thrown at him and whining about downvotes because of Bruins flair. you're getting downvoted because you're defending a piece of shit player who tries to injure people. "
Apparently “irony” isn’t either. 
"It's funny, most of your fanbases seems absolutely opposed to the view that if you are a repeat offender you should be suspended for a while. Seems like you disagree with their view that Stevens was a clean player"
"I'm saying compared to essentially every other single concussion related suspension in NHL history he got the book thrown at him, but please continue to take my words out of context it's really helping your point."
"How would you know, you're still in third grade"
Stevens played within the rules of the game at the time. Now a day he would never touch the ice if he played like that 
">I'm saying compared to essentially every other single concussion related suspension in NHL history 

And you're still wrong. 

> but please continue to take my words out of context it's really helping your point.

How about we take the context of his 6 nhl suspensions in 7 years and continual dirty play that only lead up to a 5 game suspension.

Again, no context you speak of considers a 5 game suspension as ""Throwing the book at him"" unless you are completely delusional. "
I read a lot of “The Onion” articles. 
"You might as well have said ""I understand sex because I watch a lot of porn."""

The only time Q smiled is when we won the Cup and when he was hit in the head with a stray puck. 
Fun fact: Q's go-to swear word is Cunt!
Maybe players are just masochists.
Oh also can we use this as an opportunity to point out to our knee jerk fan base as to why we shouldn't fire Q.

I’d want him standing up for me like that. "
"I would want to play for him too. He shows a lot of loyalty (to a fault) to veterans. Rozsival started about 30 games too many at the end of his career - he could barely move and it was tough to watch - every fan knew it was over but Q still rolled him out every other game. Pretty sure this is happening with Seabrook before our eyes right now lol

He apparently doesn't care if you back check as a forward anymore - insane back check was a huge factor in our cups, but they've given it up the past few seasons.

I love Q and haven't wanted him fired like these knee-jerk jackasses, but damn he drives me crazy sometimes. Dropping into ultra-defensive mode with a lead, constantly juggling lines and never letting any cohesion develop, and the consistently god-awful special teams for the last 8 seasons (why can't we hire someone to teach this team how to run a PP???).

What do you mean don’t fire him?  He’s obviously getting too soft.  Better trade a first round pick for Tortorella. 
I remember that. Absolutely brutal no goal call.
Was it a really bad call?

He's an American hero 
cuz he's good at hockey and this is a hockey forum?
Because he is one of the best hockey players in the world and a unique character.

We are #1 in something
PNC used to have the best ice according to Crosby. Then our ice guy passed away and it resembles a pond frozen under windy conditions on a 50 deg day.
I love that there is absolutely no consensus about the most underrated player. 
"Who is the most difficult player to play against? Shea Weber is 4th and only defenseman

Which defenceman is the most difficult to play against? Weber is 3rd behind karlsson and doughty"
Kinda surprising that the players don't mind the loser point as much as we do
"Nick Leddy isn't even the fastest skater on his team, did everyone who plays for the Islanders just throw their vote for him or something? "
**Toews intangibles intensifying**
"Forsberg #5 on who current player think is the best all time, but #1 on favorite player growing up. Likely because players now are younger-ish. I can attest that those late 90s/early 00s Avs are some of my favorite players too. "
Tim Peel in 3rd for best ref lmao
Foppa 5th best forward of all time? Nice.
"I wish they had a more detailed ""other"" section for the questions where ""other"" is like 70%."
"I'm happy that Peter Forsberg was most players favorite player growing up. He was absolutely incredible. 

Also pleasantly surprised that Sundin is there as well. "
Someone educate the NHLPA about Hasek's dominance.
"Nice to see Quickie up there for the 2nd hardest to score on!

Although lately it seems like he's either a brick wall or a pylon, no in between.

Also shout out to Racoon Jesus."
Subban wasnt on any of these lists. This confirms Montreal won the trade.
I love that this shits on so many of /r/hockey's opinions
Only 72.7% think the Great One is GOAT? Say what?
"So I guess that Crosby guy is pretty good at this hockey thing, eh?"
"Hardest player to play against: Sidney Crosby  

I'd imagine at least one of those votes was Methot."
lol Price tied for fourth as best goalie of all time. Insulting to Dryden that he gets the same amount of votes.
Surprised more players didn't vote for Mike Sullivan considering he's 8-0 in playoff series in the past 2 years and has a way of getting the best out of his players.
Crazy how close Crosby comes to Gretzky in terms of who people would want on their team.
Mike Babcock being 4th for coach you'd most like to play throws some water on old rumors maybe?
"Worst Ice: Hot cities and Islanders

Fucking lol.


Also how can Price be on the all time list?"
"Favourite players growing up:  Forsberg, Yzerman, Sakic, Lidstrom, Sundin.

If you ever needed to be reminded about how young NHLers are, these are players who are too young to have seen Gretzky and Lemieux play, never mind Orr and Lafleur.  "
Kucherov underrated? 
It's cool seeing Stepan getting the #2 vote as future coaching material. I could see it happening. He seems like a great teammate and leader now.
Only US rink in the best ice category.  Go Minnesota.  (I skated there a couple weeks ago and the ice was fantastic).
"TIL Steve Ott retired and is an assistant coach, weird"
Blake Wheeler is still so underrated he doesn’t even get any votes for most underrated
">Tim Peel 4.4%

wat"
"CONSPIRACY THEORY TIME!

>Who is the best forward of all time?
>Sidney Crosby: 4.9%
>Total votes: 388

Which means that 19 players voted for Crosby.

How many players are in a game per team, assuming that the goalie doesn't get the boot? 19.

The Penguins all voted for Crosby confirmed.

*Adjusts tinfoil hat*"
Which player is Sydney Crosby: 100% Sydney Crosby
It's surprising to see Rogers Place has the second best ice in the league. There' been a lot of problems with the ice there.
"I would have rather seen a poll based on how they feel about the referees and rules on the ice, fighting, the salary cap, Olympics, etc..."
"Average age of players is what, ~27?

Lotta guys grew up watching Foppa, Sakic and Roy.

...those were the days."
"I'm surprised Roy won best goalie amongst players. You don't find many NHL goalies who don't have Brodeur on their list of idols (usually accompanied by an even split of Roys and Haseks). Roy's biggest arguments for contender as ""best goalie ever"" are generally related to his SV% and GAA and we all know how much the players care about stats lol.

Not saying I personally think any of the three is a clear best player, but just surprised that Roy was able to win the vote from the players' perspectives.

----

Edit: I should clarify that I personally think Roy, Hasek, and Marty all have extremely valid arguments for being the best goalie ever. I totally understand *why* someone would pick Roy or Hasek over Marty. I just didn't expect it from the players themselves.

----

Edit 2:

For the hell of it, here are my all time rankings of Roy, Hasek and Brodeur (eras considered):

**At making percentage saves:**

Roy is #1  
Hasek is #2  
Marty is like #5 or #6  

**At making clutch saves:**

Hasek is easily #1  
Marty and Roy are tied for #3 (Sawchuck beats them both out)

**At playing the puck:**

Marty is #1 all time.  
Roy is maybe in the top 10.  
Hasek doesn't make the list ([despite trying super hard at it lol](https://youtu.be/Op8CXhTexZk?t=32)).  

---

At the end of the day for most fans of the game, it'll likely always go (possibly swapping 1 and 2):

**#1** - Hasek  
**#2** - Roy  
**#3** - Brodeur   

But the fact is that each of these three goalies perfected an entirely different playstyle and fucking DOMINATED as a result.

* Marty was legit breakout d-man with his [ability to keep the play moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdQtjBVY1sY). He stood tall as one of the last stand-up goalies and for years and years (and years) he stumped shooters with his intuition and insane hockey sense. His skills, loyalty, and eventual wisdom made him into the most essential player on the New Jersey Devils in every year they went to the cup, win or lose.

* Roy took positioning to a new level with his perfection of the butterfly/profly, and he legitimately made the position look easy. Quick wrote an TPT article about how ""impressive saves"" are just goalies making up for mistakes in positioning, and Roy just didn't seem to make those mistakes. He was just always there with a perfect angle on the puck. I'm not saying the guy doesn't have his [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhuAPmr2q50), but the myriad saves that they don't put on the reel are the ones that really matter when it comes to Patrick.

* But then there's Hasek. The [weird, flailing psychopath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLBTci7s2Uw) who will forever be the definitive flopper goalie. In leiu of Roy's cold, calculated positioning, Hasek had his spidey sense. Never has a single player caused my [jaw to drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHG-Nazzff0) so consistently than Hasek. This wasn't Jim Carey posting one lucky season either. This was a goalie who year after year made unreal saves and flat out won more games than anyone else on his teams. He wasn't perfect, and he's not as far and away as the Great One, but he's the best all time goalie to play in the NHL. Period.

The fact is, considering their era(s), all three are top 5 ALL TIME goalies no matter how you look at it (and IMO the top 3). All of them had 5+ years of being unbelievably good, and there's not many other goalies that really pull off that level of consistency in the modern era."
Can’t say I disagree with the Hawks having the best fans and best coach 
Holtby's 5% probably came from the Bruins.

Also, are Sakic and Matt Cullen related? Looks like it."

Surprised Howe didn't get more votes for Top Forward.

Wow surprised at the amount of Weber in here..

"I'm kinda surprised 17% of players answered ""Who is the greatest forward of all time?"" with anyone other than Gretzky or Lemieux. "
"I honestly think the most interesting thing about this whole thing is that Gretz only got 74% of votes for best forward of all time. You'd think he'd be uncontested, or close to it at least.

Recency bias maybe. With all due respect, some guys voted for Sid  over Wayne Gretzky."

Hasek in 3rd is outrageous. He was way better than Roy and Brodeur. Look at the stats.
"The fact that some players actually voted Carey Price as ""Best Goaltender of All Time"" shows they weren't taking this thing very seriously."
I'm suprised Subban isn't up there for best rolemodel
Jonathan Quick? Is this 2014?
Interesting to see the players' responses for the Yzerman-Sakic and Roy-Brodeur-Hasek questions
Strange to see Forsberg that high in those poll but i like it. By far my favorite player growing up
The only place we're mentioned is 4th worst ice.
"TIL Steve Ott retired and is an assistant coach, weird


"
">Who was your favourite player growing up?

Lots of Avs/Wings fan in there"
Surprised there was no Pronger mention for best defenseman. Only defenseman to win the Hart since Orr.
I wonder what Montreal is doing to make their ice so appreciated by the players. What are they doing differently from the lower ranked teams? 
WTF? The Saddledome made the list for the best ice? I've always heard it has some of the worst ice in the league. 
"My fav Foppa getting some recognition, I like!"
I like that favorite player question's results.
0% Buffalo  :')

Gooood stuff
I seriously think kapanen is up there among fastest.

"Man, we used to have best arena and best fans. I think I even feel that slipping when I go to Sharks games. They're not as full, the chants are weaker, and even the goal celebration is less enthusiastic (likely cause it's less coordinated with the new music).

I feel like this is a good example of how this is largely a popularity contest.

excuse me?"
Was really surprised Crosby was ahead of lemieux on players they would like to play with. Figured it would def be Wayne then Mario. 
So happy to see Forsberg and Lidstrom pop up several times. Forsberg was my favorite too and he was so fucking good.
"There is only 1 single thing even remotely Canucks related out of all those categories, and that is that the 5th favourite player growing up was Mats Sundin."

"Hasek in 3rd as best goalie of all time.

Wow, wrong..but okay"
"I wonder if McDavid is really the fastest? He's the fastest All-Star based off the past two years, but maybe someone else in the league has more speed? Hagelin is probably Pens fastest guy... any other thoughts from other teams?"
At least they got Bobby Orr right
"2nd in best fans? Noooo that was the one thing I thought we'd win.

Glad to see Peks up there in best goalie. Pretty cool survey."
How is Subban not one of the best role models? He's the first player that came to my mind when I saw that section.
"Wow 16% of the league is embarrassingly wrong about who the best forward of all time is.

And another 11.3% is still wrong, but just less embarassingly so."

How is PK Subban not in the top 5 as a role model?
This should prove for once and all players don't know best. Hasek is third and there's a closer race between Carey Price and Hasek than there is Hasek and fucking Brodeur? Hasek should have blown everyone else away in that question.
Sidney Crosby is the best role model?   Really?

But where is Ovechkin? Isn't he supposed to be better than Crosby? /s

Good on Schwartz getting 2nd in voting though. 
"and can we stop labeling Backstrom as underrated? i think if you're heralded as underrated for a decade, you're rated properly now"
I want to see the fun questions..... The most over rated player. The worst place to play. The most fun city to play in. The coach you don't want to play for.
I feel like Nick Leddy is so criminally underrated that he didn’t even make the underrated list.  
wonder who/how many said Wheeler
Guys who voted for Doughty and Karlsson as the most difficult defenseman to play against voted for forwards as most difficult player to play against. Guys who voted for Shea probably voted for him for both. 
"Makes sense. All those Karlsson and Doughty votes were hiding behind forwards. 

"
But he got a much higher percentage of the votes.
"I have a theory on this:

I can see a lot of forwards voting for Weber over another forward because they have to go head-to-head with the other teams' D.  The hardest person on the ice to deal with as a forward is often the meanest, hardest-to-get-by defenseman who punishes you every time you go near the puck in the offensive zone.  Conversely, defensemen might vote for forwards more often because they are tasked with shutting them down and rarely end up clashing directly with other defensemen.  As a D, the most annoying player on the ice is the best forward, who's breaking your ankles and making you look like a beer leaguer.

It would follow, then, that once asked specifically about other defensemen, the D would tend to vote for their more offensive-minded peers, whom they would have to directly try to stop from scoring more often.  Your average defenseman doesn't really have to deal with Shea Weber the way a forward does, but they might have to deal with a Karlsson or Doughty streaking in off the rush."
"The kind of people who think Karlsson is hard, are the same people who are going to find top forwards even harder."
Karlsson is a forward confirmed
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It’s cuz they are worried his shot will kill them
"Well, it's indeed hard to play against him lately since he hasn't played  since December..."
People always do the math of how the difference between the loser point and without affects things and I think there has only been one case where the playoff standings changed and I think it was only a switch in home advantage.
"I think the loser point is fine, but it needs a 3 point system.

So you lose something if your are not able to finish in regulation."
"As a player you'd probably want to be on a team with more points, and the loser point helps bad teams look close to decent in terms of point percentage."
r/hockey isn’t the bastion of knowledge and well thought out opinions that most would assume it to be. 
"The loser point is fine, you just need to award 3 for a reg win.  But yeah I was surprised it wasn't more 60/40."
There were only 411 votes out of almost 800 players so we're still missing a lot of data. 
"I wonder how much of that is due to the question that was asked.  

""DO YOU LIKE THE CURRENT WAY POINTS ARE AWARDED FOR A WIN OR A LOSS?""

I highly doubt NHL players have debated the issue as much as r/hockey has.  If you had, instead, worded the question even slightly describing that every game should be worth 3 points, I'd wager you would have seen a different result.  "
"Something I haven't seen anyone say in response to you is that this question in particular - assuming the players got the exact same wording we saw - is inherently biased. This is the NHLPA asking NHL players, ""do you agree with the current system?"" Some players will say Yes even if they would prefer a different system because 1) They currently play under the existing system, so some might consider it hypocritical to diss it, 2) To say No is to be contrarian, and 3) it's easy in general to agree with a leading question. It requires less thought and I imagine some of the 500 players might have wanted to simply finish the survey as quickly as possible. In addition, the question does not propose an alternative to the existing point system, so some players might not even know what a different format would look like, let along how to assess it.

If the question was worded,  ""Which point system do you think is best? A - 2 pts for any win, 1 pt for OT/SO loss, 0 pt for reg. loss;  B - 3 pts for reg win, 2 pt for OT/SO win, 1 pt for OT/SO loss, 0 pt for reg. loss, or C - a different system than those two?"" If that was the wording I imagine the results would look a lot different."
I also don't think Grabner is faster than Miles Wood
"I don't watch the Islanders often, but does he accelerate faster?

I could see a guy with killer acceleration being a lot more difficult than a top speed. That's what will turn 1v1s into breakaways, or help make odd man rushes. For the players, the guy who always seems to get away from you is the one who you're going to remember as fast."
He probably frustrated some players with breakouts or closing speed on back checks and that's why that idea is burned in their mind.

"I mean, it does make some sense since he probably is the best Swedish player of all time - hands down. Just sucks his career got cut short because he had amazing stats, he paved the way for alot of forwards today - and gave Swedish players a better reputation overall. 

There is no coincidence that there is a shootout move named after him. 

When EK65 made the pass to Hoffman from hos backend - People Called it ""Forsberg-move"". 

Edit:
I can assure you alot of Swedish forwards grew up idolizing him - and I guess so did alot of other NHL-players because he was THAT good. 

And to be fair. It is easy for us to whip out stats and say ""he did more points"" but you can't really know how good they were unless you've seen Them, heard of Them, or played against Them."
Forsberg is my all time favorite player. It makes me so happy to see him on this list. And yeah the Avs were absolutely stacked those years.
He only got 4.4% of votes. 90% of the league could hate him.
"4.4% of the vote.  113 total votes.  

Five people who cared to vote in this catergory think Tim Peel is the best referee."
"The internet circlejerking about something they don’t understand? No that could never happen, it’s the players who are wrong."
"Tim Peel is actually a good ref. 

The hate on him from fans is due to EXTREME selection bias and of course hardcore circlejerking. Oh, and most fans don't know shit all about the rules like they think they do.

IIRC scouting the refs did a good article on how undeserved the hate on him is.

Edit: it was actually [Wyshynski](https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/my-night-at-the-bar-with-tim-peel--nhl-ref-and-object-of-scorn-171058557.html) that did the article. I highly recommend anyone to read it. Some enlightening bits in there, such as this:

>I’ve often talked about the “cloud of incompetence” that follows Peel around, and he confirmed something I’ve suspected about that: Since he’s a veteran official in the NHL, he’s tasked with mentoring younger referees, who often make mistakes. They happen in his games, so he gets the blame"
"lol, came here to post this, beaten by two people already.

Fuck Tim Peel"
"Terrible calls aside, if you watch some of the ref miced up videos, he's one of the more chatty refs.  I could see 5 players (look at the vote tally) from teams that didn't have an awful call against them vote him as the best."
"I'm wondering if that's because the US/Canadian votes get spread across a lot more players, but 90% of the Swedish players vote for Forsberg."
Pleasant surprise!
Ya but that 70% is probably split between 40 players. Can’t really expand on that. 
A lot of Leafs fans growing up. 
"Rules for being the greatest:

Be Canadian

"I can see a case made for all 3: Hasek was extraordinary, Roy was successful as fuck and Brodeur has the stats (1st in wins, shutouts, etc).

But to quote an article from the Score:

>You don't see 50,000 goalies trying to play like Dominik Hasek or Martin Brodeur these days because everyone coming up has chosen to emulate the best: Saint Patrick. His style was so effective it eventually forced the league to call for equipment changes. How's that for changing the game?

In the article they explain why each is the best goalie of all time, which goes to show that there just isn't a clear answer.

Brodeur, Hasek or Roy: Who ya got?
https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/691031"
When I got to goalie's and saw him at 3rd with such a low percentage I was shocked.  To me he is #1 of all time... 
"This is the one the made me go ""Oh come on!""

Obviously I love Patrick Roy, but to me there's no question Dominik Hasek was the best of all time."
"The Dominator > Brodeur > Roy (oversized pads, sorry) > Carey Price.

If I had to pick one player on my team from the present, Carey Price is going number 2 overall behind McDaddy. Nothing replaces a solid backstop. Never forget Tim Thomas and Krejci carrying to B's to a championship with those acrobatic saves and sweet assists."
Most of the players grew up watching SCF's between Roy and Brodeur.  The media hyped up that rivalry at the time.  This voting really doesn't surprise me.
"While we're at it, someone educate them about Phil Esposito's dominance."
"I have no idea who that is, so I googled Racoon Jesus and got this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhTmwHsMlr4"
That nickname is hilarious.
Kopi seems to be well-respected amongst the rest of the league.
Who refers to a goalie as a pylon..
Hall wasn’t in any lists either. Confirms we win the trade. 
"Nashville only has a goalie, coach and fans. What else do we need to be competitive? Asking for a friend."
Does it?
"Reminds me of this from Letterkenny:

""Gretz holds or shares 61 records in the show, you piece of shit. Don't nickel and dime the Great One."" "
"I am one of those people who think think Super Mario is better. I mean, no doubt Wayne is called the great one for a reason but I think Mario was stronger, had to overcome more adversity, and played in an era with better goalies and defense.  Gretzky dominated more, but I would take Mario's skillset over 99."
There are solid arguments to be made for Mario and Orr.
"Gretzky is the best and it isn't close. Lemiux a distant 2nd, and then behind him are Orr, Sakic, Forsberg, Jagr, Howe, Bourque, etc. in any order really. But top 2 are definitely Wayno and Mario"
"I know it’s basically blasphemous to some to say anyone is better than 99, but I’m a strong believer that 66 is the greatest ever. Yes, I’m a Pens fan, so I’m biased.. but there’s obviously good reason for this opinion. Super Mario deserves a lot more praise for being possibly the GOAT, since his career wasn’t a smooth one whatsoever and he still did what he did"
"Yeah, he's ok I guess."
"I mean, it's the player voting, what do they know about being good at hockey?"
You really think he would finger him out as the hardest? 
Recency bias is real. Players aren't immune from it. 
"Insulting to Lundqvist and Luongo too, who have been every bit as good as Price for much longer"
"I mean Crosby got 4.9% of the votes for best forward of all time. That's just... he's up there but best ever? Seems outrageous.

I love Lidstrom but I'm pretty shocked he stole 29% of the best defenseman ever votes away from Orr.

There's a fair amount of recency bias going on in all these polls."
Problem there is that it is stupid to think these guys know the history of the league simply through osmosis.  That is a question that was begging for recency bias.
Weird af
"He's not necessarily a players' coach, though. He's demanding. He holds guys accountable (for the most part). 

Also, he's only coached a couple years for the Penguins and Bruins. Not many guys in the NHL have played for him. The other guys on the list have been around a while."
Yeah he also seems like a huge hardass though. 
"Could be taking into consideration the modern game. The 80's were different, after all. Idk."
None of the current players played with or against Gretzky.  Recency bias.
Having him above Mario blows my mind
"It could, but it's still only 7.5% of players. There's another 92.5% of players that could all have Babcock as the coach they'd least like to play for right. The data doesn't tell us about the other side of things"
"I did my best work as a student in classes with a tough teacher/professor. I perform best when my manager has tough, but fair, expectations of me. So, Babcock's reputation and the results of this player poll aren't necessarily at odds with each other IMO."
I think the players that hate him are super vocal which makes it seem like there's a lot of them.
People just also might not like how strict he is. Wasnt Larkin gonna go another year in college had he remained after the 2015 season?
Considering he is widely considered the best coach in the league and still isnt first for wanting to play with I think it does nothing to get rid of him being tough to play for. Not everyone dislikes him but you'd think he'd be higher.
">how can Price be on the all time list?

Not that Price isn't fucking great, but recency bias. They've played against Price but haven't played against most of the old guys."
"> Also how can Price be on the all time list?

People who think he's the best goalie today and who think that goalies are just consistently getting better, I'd imagine. They aren't voting on a scale so at least some people would think this way IMO."
A lot of those were surprising to me.  Spezza?  Loved him but I never really thought of him becoming a coach before.  Guess he’s got some good leadership qualities.  Also I too want Ott to be a head coach.  I would love to watch his press conferences
I'm really surprised Schiefele didn't make the future coach one.
They are only displaying about 15-20% of the votes. Wheeler could be number 6 for all we know. 
"That included 113 responses, so that comes out to 5 players voting for him. Just... if anyone was wondering."
Malkin definitely would've voted for himself just to mess with Crosby lol. 
Also its because Rexall Place had a long history of having the best ice in the league. So anything short of perfection feels like a downgrade. Like during the decade of darkness one of the sales pitches to free agents to join The Oilers is ummmm we have some of the best ice in the league. It was that sad. 
"Most of those issues were last season, I haven't heard much complaining this year. If I recall, McDavid spent some time with the ice makers during the summer and they got it sorted out. "
"That's what I thought it was going to be about, guess those kinds of questions aren't appropriate to talk about during the season "
I'm guessing Foppa is Forsberg? What's up with the nickname I've never heard it before 
yes
"> At making percentage saves:
> 
> Roy is #1
> Hasek is #2
> Marty is like #5 or #6

Era adjusted save percentage Hasek is easily top of all time. And yes, someone ran these numbers a while back."
"I was a little surprised too but after seeing all the guys clearly idolizing the Avs/Wings rivalry and players, he may be getting the bump from that. Also imo people on here are much more in the ""obviously Hasek"" camp than in other places"
"I think the 3 Conn Smythes is the biggest factor, especially given players likely appreciate the difficulty of winning in the playoffs more than the average fan"
Fact is Roy is the best goalie of all time. Glad that professional hockey players agree with me. 
"> The fact is, considering their era(s), all three are top 5 ALL TIME goalies no matter how you look at it (and IMO the top 3). All of them had 5+ years of being unbelievably good, and there's not many other goalies that really pull off that level of consistency in the modern era.

The adoption of the goalie mask (and better equipment in general) makes comparing goalies of the different eras virtually impossible.

How do you compare someone like Glenn Hall (502 consecutive games in net) who played the majority of his career without a mask and used leather equipment, against someone like Hasek who wore a reinforced bucket on his head and wrapped himself in (essentially) body armour?

Is Hasek anything like he was if he's wearing Hall's equipment? Does he even TRY playing net as a kid if there are no masks?  

If Hall was given all of Hasek's equipment, maybe he's even better (removing the fear of the slap shot to the face or other weakly protected areas)."
"> Roy took positioning to a new level with his perfection of the butterfly/profly

That's probably why he is so high. Goalies today are playing the style made dominant by Roy. "
"> At playing the puck:
> 
> Marty is #1 all time.

Yes, Turco was like a 3rd D-man back there!"
"Thanks for being objective.  [Flair, move, now!](https://youtu.be/t-OCjvbV2Z4)"
couldn't agree more!
"Can't wait to see the Nashville 'hockey started 11 months ago' fans lose their mind. 

That being said, I'm a Hawks fan and think our fans suck these days. The UC is a funeral parlor even when we're winning. I'm hoping this crap season will scare away the 'taking my client to the game' morons who ask questions like 'why isn't 2 going all the way to the goalie?'. "
"Idk about fans because of the way a lot of people have... ahem... turned quickly on the team this season. But I'm probably overreacting because of my personal annoyance at this- all teams have some dumbass fans. 

And I hope every one of said dumbass fans sees the number of players who'd love to play for Q and remembers how lucky we are to have a future HoF coach.

Edit: Also, I'm kinda surprised Babs isn't higher. I think he's brilliant."
Will you guys please fire Q in the offseason so we can pick him up?
"Id still objectively take babs as the best coach, but i could see why he wouldn't get the votes lol. "
I came into the comments to say this. Pretty sure that 5% represents the entire Bruins roster's votes. 
"Considering everyone and their mother has been making arguments against Kucherov winning the Hart, ""how could he win on a team w/ Stamkos"" etc., maybe it's more of a ""yes this guy's actually that good"""
"One of the top defencemen was on our team for a few years also, though it would be somewhat disingenuous to call him a Penguin. "
"He was a dick on the ice, but he also always seemed to be a huge locker room guy. He's the kind of guy that you  hate to play against, but love to play with. "
They were saying he was going to be a coach while he was a player already.
"I didn't even know he was an assistant coach lmao

I can see it though"
"I mean, I'm sure he's great, but he's been a coach for 6 months. There's no way he can be THAT fucking good."
"The players today are young enough to be Gordie's great grandkids. Considering how little people today seem to understand or appreciate history (hockey or otherwise) this isn't surprising. Also, recently bias.  "
Have you watched any of his games? Or the skills competition?
Maybe people just really like the musical stylings of The Fratellis. Especially Canucks fans. 
"Except for the guy who pulled Pardys helmet off.

And except for the ones who chant racist stuff."
"True, but then again, we didn't get called out for having shitty ice."
Neither did we
He's old
"Right? I would have loved to see enough agreement on one of these to not have 5 circles. Cause we aren't ranking top 5 here, these are people choosing who is #1

And I gotta say, it's outrageous that anyone would put Sid at #1. I know 4.9&#37; isn't a lot, but it clearly should be 0&#37;. He's really good. Probably top 5, without question top 10. But there is absolutely zero argument as to why he is better than Gretzky or Lemieux. "
Lmao. No. If you're butthurt towards Canadians you should pick a new sport to watch. 
You've been running since 1975.  How far are you going?
Why? I really don't think Subban is nearly as popular amoung the players as he is with fans.
Bergeron deserves more than 6 %.
He lied about the bad breath comments tho /s
"Do you not watch him play? He's either a sieve or a brick wall. Makes sense that the players who remember playing him during a good performance would have gotten a really powerful impression of him.  

The ones who played him on a bad night voted for someone else."
Of the goalies who have 40 games played this season he's 6th in SV% and 7th in GAA. He's having a fine season. Just not a Vezina finalist kind of season. 
iS jOnAtHaN qUiCk ELiTe?
Because Pronger didn't deserve the Hart that year.
The answers shown aren't ALL the answer and I think the players got to pick whoever and not a multiple option type of thing. Players who probably would've picked Wood might've picked McDavid instead.
"I don’t know the modern era as well, but I do know in the nineties some of the guys who were top scorers and all stars who everyone considered the fastest would get smoked in races by like 4th line checking centers.  Some fast dudes hiding out there.  But you so rarely are doing a full ice sprint and it is not really what hockey speed is about anyway."
"Yeah you’re right, I totally trust Reddit’s judgement more than the players’ /s"
The concussions get worse by the day.
"Stamkos is still the biggest star of the Lightning to most casual fans, while Kucherov is there as the #1 favorite to win the Hart trophy this year. He's underrated for sure from that perspective"
Hey give it a few years and the answers will all be either the oilers or the pens. 
"I was thinking the same.  Maybe around the league is different, but down here, listening to both tv & radio broadcasts, he is very often discussed as skilled, smart player, etc; even when he goes thru off nites or scoring slumps.  I love the guy, but I would hardly think of him as under rated.  Under rated on the lightning would probably be Brayden Point, imo."
"Not just as a pens fan, what makes you disagree?"
"You mean the same Toews who lead his team to 3 Stanley Cups in 5 years, won the Conn Smythe and consistently top 5 in the Selke voting for past 8 years? "
I know this is /s and I definitely laughed at it but I think the downvotes are because that argument ended 10 years ago. 
If he was canadian he'd be up there

"
You've seen people talking and articles mentioning how he treats his fans right? Could you name a better role model?
DAE CROSBY IS A CRYBABY AND HE SUX
"Most considerate fans. 

All the seniors are sleeping and not bothersome"
Dude what?
"I was happy we didn't make the ""hot=bad ice"" list.

I guess we kicked our Flobros the consolation point last night in appreciation. "
Too humid is the reason given.
"That's experience for you. This guy could probably walk into the arena and sense when the moisture is too high/low, how outside temps during the year will affect the ice, etc.

If you don't get the formula right the entire day can be impacted if its hot out. You can't get on top of it until the sun goes down. "
"Interesting that besides the Bell Centre, there is no overlap between best ice and favorite rink. You'd think that was the biggest thing players would care about. Evidently atmosphere and facilities matter a lot too. City size too, as its MTL, CHI, NY and LA rounding out top 4."
"Routine cold temperatures outside for most of the season probably helps a bit, all but one of the bad ice is located in places that are rather warm by NHL standards. 

Fun fact, Brooklyn is part of NYC, the northernmost city with a sub\-tropical climate in North America!"
Talk to anyone who curls. Ice making is serious business.
"I imagine it also has something to do with ""Canada has less variation in temperature during the NHL season."" Here in Winnipeg, we barely see weather above freezing for the entire season. I imagine Florida would be hell for icemakers. "
That's what I mean. If a player is universally considered underrated... he probably isn't.
Could you imagine the anger and hatred if it came out that Crosby voted for himself as most underrated player? 
He was my go to most underrated. NHLPA stole my thunder and intelligent take.
"I mean, when you say underrated it really matters who is doing the rating.  Underrated by players? No.  Underrated by media? Think so."
"Backstrom is definitely underrated by the media and a vast majority of 30 fanbases. His name pops up every now and then in ""most underrated"" conversations and then immediately fades away. Meanwhile, he's an elite centre in the league and has been for almost his entire career."
"What would you rank him in the nhl currently? top 5? top 10? top 20? etc? When its not at least top 10 you'll understand why he's so underrated. Being underrated doesn't mean you're a nobody, it means people *still* don't rate you as high as they should be. "
"That's an interesting hypothesis, and it explains the percentages well considering forwards outnumber defence 2:1."
Sorry about your arm.
"The counter argument though is that changing how points are awarded changes how teams play.  That was, after all, the entire point of the loser point.

So on a 3-2-1-0 system, the results would change again."
Good point
Actually I believe we wouldn't have made the playoffs in 2006 and it's possible I'd have become a... *throws up in mouth* ...leafs fan
I have a hard time getting on board with this. You shouldn't ever be punished for winning a close game. 
"That’s what the loser point is though. Regular games are worth 2 points, but ties are worth 3, because the loser gets awarded a point out of nowhere. Hence, loser point. "
"3 points for shutout win, 2 for a regulation/OT win, and 1 for OT loss. That’s what I’ve been wanting."
"Fools me all the time, I check the Flames record and it's 33-20-14 and I'm like ""sweet way above .500! So why do we suck?"" and I have the sad realization that we're actually 33-34, knew should never have learned math. "
"I mean

It’s players’ opinions.  A lot of our opinions are different.  The fact I think it’s dumb some games are worth 3 points and others 2 does not  become more or less valid because players like it"
"Hmmm, you can hear this opinion everywhere, TV, radio, twitter. 

r/hockey has not invented the ""loser point sucks"" opinion. "
Probably still the best place to talk hockey on the internet though.
Touché
"We should just list the best players, arenas, fans, Dmen, and any other facets of the game and have NHL players read them so they can learn more about the sport



Hope I dont actually need this but just in case

/s "
"Even though I disagree with Wood not in the convo for fastest skating, it's probably just because he's young. The other have more offensive upside too."
Reputation goes a long way though...
That's what I was saying
"Barzal is the fastest Islander, I’d say. Kid can fly. "
my absolute favorite part is the fact that we're winning 6-1
"Best Swedish Forward of all time, but Lidstrom is the best player"
"It really is wrongly named after him.  
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QobAlzxDdXc) is it's predecessor.  
  
Nevertheless, I agree with most of your stuff and I believe Forsberg is 4th in A/GP with only Mario, Gretzky and Orr ahead of him... THAT is pretty damn sick."
">When EK65 made the pass to Hoffman from hos backend - People Called it ""Forsberg-move"".

That's not what the Forsberg move is. It's the finish by Hoffman with one hand. Radulov had done it too a few days before too. "
"> since he probably is the best Swedish player of all time - hands down

first of all how dare you"
"So you're saying only one team likes him. 

Now, which one is it???"
"Exactly. This was the LEAST voted on question. I'm sure a bunch of players just said ""fuck the refs"" and voted for nobody. "
"Well A. He only got 4.4% of the vote. Thats far from enough to make any sort of conclusions

and B. Name recognition goes a long way. Simply getting your name out there can be quite an effective strategy in elections etc. "
Five players voted Peel. You're circlejerking now like that's conclusive or even meaningful in any way.
My problem with Peel is that he doesn't call blatantly dirty hits that happen right in front of him.  He calls stick infractions and other stuff pretty fairly and evenly.  Then a guy gets boarded and there's nothing.
That's an interesting point by Wyshynski. It does shed some light on things.
"""Tim Peel can be a bad referee. His mistakes aren’t just goofs, they’re glaring, embarrassing moments. There’s a reason fans know his name, and it’s not because we write blog posts about him. It’s because he makes questionable calls, be it because he’s serving the League’s best interests or because he just didn’t get it right."" This is the article you're using as a basis for your argument that Peel is a good referee ? (he's not) Did you read it? Because it's basically Wysh saying, 'Peel is awful at his job but we've been too mean to him and I feel bad"". "
Fuck that he's a biased clown of a ref. 
Could also be because many of the players voting on this poll were at a very impressionable age when Forsberg was being dominant.
I'm going to ignore your logic and assume it's because Forsberg is the GOAT
"an impressive amount of players also had him as their favorite to watch growing up, and that subject includes two more swedes in the top 5, so i think a lot of players just think he was that good.

could also be a possibility that players were able to vote for 1-3 or 1-5, and a lot of players would put forsberg in that range somewhere."
"Prime Forsberg probably was that good tbh, or close to it. Think Crosby but meaner. And a lot of players saw him in his prime when they grew up."
Cup wins matter a lot for NHL players.
"> *Rules for being the greatest:*  
  
> *Be Canadian*

> *Don't be European*

How does Hasek get 4.5x as many votes as Dryden (six cups and five vezinas in an eight year career, 258W, 57L, 74T) if those are the rules?  Somebody (or most people, actually) doesn't appear to be following these rules of yours."
Forsberg #1 for favourite player growing up tho. They obviously asked European players too.
"> His style was so effective it eventually forced the league to call for equipment changes. How's that for changing the game?  

I mean, the league did repaint the ice and change the rules because Brodeur's puckhandling was so effective, but I see the point.  

Like you said, it's a 3-horse race. How you rank them really depends on what you value.  

Hasek was the best pure puck-stopper ever. Need someone to stop one shot? He's your man. He had a slinky for a spine and was just ridiculous to play against. He was also the most entertaining goalie to watch. He never made a save the same way twice, making him so unpredictable that it was even tougher to decide how to shoot on him.  

Roy was the most clutch goalie ever. Need to win one game? He's your man. He also perfected a style and had more influence on how the position is played than anyone. And the son of a bitch was intimidating as fuck, too.  

Brodeur was a model of consistency and his puckhandling was on another level. Need to build a franchise around one goalie? He's your man. He would've started all 82 games if the coaches let him. His ability to play the puck saved wear and tear on his defensemen, forced opponents to choose between dumping to him or carrying across Scott Stevens' blueline, and led to rule changes."
"That's an opinion I only ever see on /r/hockey. I assume it's because most people this sub can't remember or weren't alive to watch those goalies. 

Any other hockey players I know have Roy first. You just can't beat 4 cups and 3 Conn Smyths."
I don't think any goalie during the time of brown leather pads and before the invention of the butterfly should be in the conversation of best goalie of all time. 
Raccoon Jesus is Kopitar. https://i.imgur.com/3jEdxgQ.jpg
"[In the name of Saint Martinez, Raccoon Jesus, and Holy Toffoli, may you find your way](http://i.imgur.com/Qdx9mRq.jpg)"
Its the GOAT
Brilliant
"A defenseman that appears 3 times on this list would help. Well trade him for you for PK, friends and family discount. "
Blawkhawks having best fans is a pretty big one.
"I saw ""Crosby is a bitch"" with like a +40 upvotes here yesterday. 

This has him as the best role model. 

So yea I'd say so "
"Well obviously Orr and Mario are up there with Gretzky in skill, but career-wise Wayne wins it hands down (imo). If Mario faced less adversity it would be a two horse race, or if Orr had better knees he could probably be #1. On the flip side you have someone like Howe who had a top 3 career based on his longevity but was the next step down from the defacto top 3 (though Gretzky and Orr both consider him the best). If we're looking at most skilled player to play the game it's close, if we're looking at greatest player in the game it isn't (again, all my opinion). "
"Mario is what you would get if you were told to design the perfect hockey player. He was big, strong, a great skater, had incredible hands and wrists, could make a pass over a stick, through the skateholder, and between two guys, and he knew where everyone was on the ice. He also had the incredible fight with cancer and was hindered by injuries his entire career. Great player, great story.

Gretzky just kinda had It. He wasn't in Lemieux's physical categories, he didn't have his struggle with disease and injury. But his incredible vision was beyond what anyone has done since and FAR beyond what anyone had done before. He was the guy playing 6-D chess when everyone else was playing hopscotch.

Lemieux was the best at doing what he did. Gretzky did things that nobody else could, not consistently"
"Philly gave #66 a standing ovation on the last day of chemo. He is the only thing that can bring the fanbases together. Good post, fully agree.

Ps it's gameday so I hate you again"
Mario also was the entire Pens team a lot of the time. Gretzky had a better team around him. Ultimately Gretzky had an obviously better career though. 
"I think it is fair (or at least debatable) to say Lemieux was more talented, but Gretzky absolutely had the better career."
Hmm.. I wonder if he filled out this form digitally..
What's odd is that Price's recent amazing season was 14-15. This season he's played like garbage
better really. Price has had some really poor seasons. Case in point this season
"Neither reached a peak Price did, and price dominated the Olympics and World Cup during that peak. "
"Yes and no. Marc Andre Fleury has been great too but also a product of good teams with good defense. Henrik has had great teams most of his career. Luongo with the Canucks was unstoppable because that team was stacked. On the Panthers Luongo wasn't as unstoppable, though very good, a la Price.

Carey Price has really had to battle with some bad Montreal teams. And is routinely the best player on their team."
"The way I justify people comparing these modern players with the historical hockey legends is that the game is so different now, faster now, etc. It seems like more guys have to be in the best shape possible to play the game at the NHL level. Not to mention that goaltending has seemed to get better as hockey went through the years. Pads got bigger, techniques got better, etc. Harder to get points.

I'd love to see Gretzky, Lemieux, and Jagr on a line in their prime vs Sid, Kane, and Geno (or whoever you'd like to interchange for who you think are the best from either the old guys or the modern era) in their prime. I think a lot of people would be surprised."
Justifying Crosby as the best forward ever isn't that outrageous. You can simply choose to ignore anything era related and take players as they are.
"depends how you look at it. In a vacuum Crosby is probably the best player ever. time travel prime mario or wayne to now and sid would probably whoop them.

However if you give them the same training, diet, equiptment, all that changes"
"At least in those two cases, those players were the best players at their position for the better part of a decade (at least). In Price's case, I think there's a stronger argument for Luongo and Lundqvist, who've maintained that high level of play far longer than Price has. Price has six seasons above a .915 save percentage. Luongo and Lundqvist have 13 and 11 respectively."
Lidstrom isn't as shocking as Scott Niedermayer being named by 1.3% as the best ever 
Funny. I thought there was a fair amount of rosy retrospection. How many of today's players actually watched Bobby Orr?
"You can gauge the average age of the players by looking at favorite players they like growing up. You see Lidstrom and Forsberg there and they creep in as best all time in their respective positions. So yeah, recency bias. Jagr is interesting because the current lot grew up idolizing him and playing with/against him, too. "
">There's a fair amount of recency bias going on in all these polls.


I'm not so sure. I'd take prime Pronger over prime Lindstrom (fight me), yet nobody here said Pronger. So I think it cuts both ways."
"The only reason Lidstrom didn't have 90% of the vote, much like his playing career, is because he isn't Canadian."
Maybe they never heard of Gretzky since he hasn't played in so long.
"Still goes to show how much respect they have. Their other choice is literally named ""The Great One."""
That work ethic.
Both great players but they know Crosby is also a great guy so I can see it. Take the slightly worse player you know is nice.
Kinda makes me wonder how many players on current teams don’t vote for their current coaches/teams
Also considering our media I imagine players vocally upset with Babcock gain more attention than players upset with smaller market/lower profile coaches. 
prolly arent too fond of his neanderthal opinions on concussions either
"His demands are high, but his achievements also speak for themselves "
"It's still kinda insane that they would hold Price in the same category as some of those other guys. Hell, I would argue he might not even be the best goalie still active in the game today. Hank and Lu come to mind. "
"I mean, Quick has 2 cups and he isn't even in the top 20 probably. Crawford has 3 and he probably isn't even in the top 50. "
"5 trolls, I'd love to see that personality in post game interviews"
That's still 5 too many
"Supposedly the best curling ice in the world is the U of A South campus.

I guess there's nothing to do in Edmonton winter's other than learn how to make really good ice 

Edit: and drink."
"So because he’s a good hockey player, that makes him an expert at making ice thats NHL quality? How does that make sense? "
"No real interesting story, generally just a diminutive for people with the last name Forsberg, afaik."
si
"Uh, do you have a source on this, because I don't believe that to be true at all.

Roy even missed the last year of the dead puck era before the lockout..."
"True, that does seem to be the gist here.

I think he was absolutely the most talented player at skillfully keeping the puck from going into the net, but there is a lot more to being a good goaltender and a LOT more to being a great player on a sports team in general."
"I can compare it because I'm simply not factoring that in.

Sure, Glenn Hall might have been a better goalie if he DID have the better equipment and training and advancements in medicine/quality of life that Hasek had, but he didn't.

I'm not really interested in any era adjustments beyond statistical ones. When you start to factor in things like equipment and just straight up questioning whether Hasek would even want to play without that equipment, the conversation gets a bit too ridiculous for me personally."
"I’ve always thought the UC was too quiet. Some arenas people are going nuts for 5 minutes after they score, the UC is pretty tame in comparison. "
It gets so quiet for so long. Aside from the idiots shouting SHOOT IT on a dump for a line change.
"It's tough because the comparison is always going to be 2009 and 2010 playoffs which were louder than anything since. Also, this season especially, I don't feel like it being louder really makes the games better to the point where people need to force it. When there have been exciting games though, it has gotten loud."
Started watching hockey 9 years ago Nashville fans>Chicago fans don’t @ me
"If your username is true, you're getting a whole lot of overreactions."
"To me that's more of a ""most valuable player"" vs ""best player"" debate. I agree with what you're saying for sure but it's like saying Malkin is underrated because he plays with Crosby - slightly true but he's still super recognized as a top player"
"Thought about mentioning that, but Coffey was already Coffey before he got to the pens (if that dumb statement makes sense). "
I'm more incredulous that this is his first year of being an assistant coach. I'm sure he's a nice guy but give it a little time
"Yeah, Orr and Gretzky called Howe the goat, but this is another generation removed from that (also, I doubt the NHL/WHA had much penetration into non-NA markets back then). "
"I was being sarcastic. Every time he's mentioned, his speed gets talked about. I think I heard it about 65 times when we played the Oilers."
how are you posting this without wi-fi?
TBD.
"You're probably right, maybe I'm misunderstanding what rolemodel means in this context"
No kidding.  I remember hearing of a player who told their kid to model their play after Bergeron and not themself
"Hes a Leafs fan, so he watches the Kings twice a year. He doesnt know shit about Quick"
"I mean, that sounds like Cam Ward to me. Is he anywhere close to being an elite goalie any more?"
"If you change the cut to more than 30 games, he drops further (behind Crawford, MAF, and Raanta, all starters who were injured for part of the year). 

I'm not saying he's bad. But he's just not elite any more."
No.
[deleted]
3% of NHL players think Carey Price is the best goalie of all time! That's absolutely insane. Their status as NHL players doesn't mean they know the game's history better than everyone else.
Or the judgement of any other hockey pundits just about ever? 
"Probably losing to him in the Stanley Cup final and making a completely uneducated statement. Surely, anyone who has read anything about what Crosby has done on the ice AND off the ice, particularly for youth hockey-in Pittsburgh and in Cole Harbour would be hard pressed to think he's not worthy of being on that list. But hey, ggs 😉🐧"
"He has a reputation around the league, among fans of the other teams, as one of the [dirtiest players in the league](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdfsSqqxcf8)."
Also captained Team Canada to two gold medals
"I would think so dude, but someone has already brought it up here this year again. 

Just to clarify also my thoughts on Crosby. 

I love me some McDavid, he’s awesome to watch and a great player. 

I would take Crosby over him any day. "
Its a player poll though.
"Pick a new sport to follow of you're butthurt towards Canada. 

Maybe these players see things on the ice differently than you. 

Id wager you cant skate and have never played. This is a player poll. People who have played see the game differently. (Ovechkin hasnt made it past round 2. The ""controller disconnect"" plays) 

But go on making massive generalizations about all the Canadians in the league lmao. Are you referring to the ones who brought chicago cups? 

Its a canadian dominated league, get over it. 







"
"Does he have his own toaster though like Toews, Gretzky, and McDavid tho?"
"> All the seniors are sleeping and not bothersome

Isn't Florida the most dangerous place for pedestrians or something?"
"Facility overhaul was one of the most significant improvements in the Vinik era. The arena got major upgrades, and I believe a new ice crew that takes really good care of the ice there."
Heel Crosby is my spirit animal
That would honestly be hilarious. 
Also it's important to note that this sub is a small minority of hockey fans. When I talk to my relatives about hockey they often times haven't even heard of lesser name stars out east. Just because we all know how good a player is doesn't mean the average fan will. I'd bet a lot of hockey fans don't know how good Barkov is or even recognize names of players like Slavin and Schwartz. 
"I don't think he's underrated by the media. He just has 0 personality and isn't all that flashy, so he doesn't get much attention. He's forgettable despite being great."
"> he's an elite centre in the league and has been for almost his entire career.

yeah and since ~2013, no one would dispute that, he's no longer underrated, he's elite and rated as such"
I swear I had it earlier.
Yeah they would change for the better.
"Should other teams be punished BECAUSE it was a close game?

Somehow two of your rivals get three total points out of a game because it went to OT? While you win 5-0 and only get two?"
"The problem is right now going to overtime is the mutual best interest for both teams as long as they don't care about their opponent's points since you go from 1 point on average for a regulation finish to 1.5 for OT. If you took away a point just for going to OT then instead of seeing both teams playing lame duck hockey in the last 5 minutes of a tie game it'll be some intense shit as both teams try to get all three points. Not to mention that I don't think NHL OT as it currently exists does a great job of deciding who the better hockey team is, it's a much more limited skill set and limited set of players on display, and thus I think the reward should be limited as well."
"You're not punished for winning, you're punished for being tied after 60 minutes. "
"But you should be punished for not trying the last 2 mins to win the game in the regular time, at the risk of losing it. Just because its win/win."
But the team didn't win in 60 minutes. That's why they get one less point. 
"He means make regular time wins worth 3 points for the winner. 3 for regular wins, 2 for OT wins, 1 for OTL. Basically making it so points aren't created out of nowhere in OT games"
"Definitely not saying your opinion is invalid, but r/hockey definitely has a certain smugness about it. That’s all. Are people actually surprised players opinions differ from your average redditor? 

Side question - what’s with everyone here starting comments with “I mean.” I see it in every thread, multiple times. "
Grabner probably got votes because people know him. Who aside from the devils know miles wood? He's still so young.
"The entire team is yelling [""Stop! Stop! They're already dead!""](https://giphy.com/gifs/amnZC37fDEuoE/html5)

but Toews is calling for [more dogs](https://i.imgur.com/2yAEOYj.gifv)"
"Ive been a Wings fan since 94 and Forsberg was a better player than Lidstrom. Obviously they played different positions but everyone who thinks Crosby is the best player of all time doesn't need to look far to realize that the best comparison to Crosby is Forsberg. They play a nearly identical game and if Forsberg didn't suffer foot issues later in his career he would be even higher on all time lists. 

"
I am going to have to disagree with that one. And don't get me wrong - i love Lidström. For sure he is one of the best defencemen. But the raw skill that Forsberg had is just unmatched from ANY swedish player. 
"It's not always the guy who makes the move first that gets his name on it. Foppa did it in a much more meaningful and memorable moment, which is why most people will remember him for it and thus call the move the Forsberg."
"Yeah, I am aware that the move is ""stolen"" - but he did it with everyone watching him during One of the greatest hockey memories in Sweden. 

Yeah I mean - just think of what more His legacy could be If he wasn't plagued by injuries."
"Well, [it's not the Penguins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UumKqBscT00)."
Shouldve had a 'none of the above' choice
Except all the Wes McCauley fans
I absolutely believe 4% of people would vote him as a joke.
All the players know all of the refs by name. It isn't as if Tim is more well known amongst players than other refs.
These players KNOW the refs dude. It isnt just name recognition. If he was as bad as this sub claims then he would have BAD name recognition.
"This tends to be a league-wide issue, IMO, one that frustrates me to no end. How many boardings get called these days? Charges? Checking-from-behind? Hardly any. But the league clamps down on the super ticky tack stuff for some reason.

Parise's back surgeries are a result of the league not calling that kind of stuff. I hate those cross checks to the kidneys, but they let it go all the time."
"The article says he makes mistakes, no shit. Every ref does. Including horrible, glaringly obvious ones. I've made them myself.

Get a clue dude."
"That must be why the NHL has had him ref over 1000 games, officiate Winter Classic games, always do the postseason, and why he's reffed the Olympics, including medal games.

Makes perfect sense."
"Oh, I watched him play and I know how good he was in his prime.  It's just not often that his name gets thrown out there among ""best of all time"" discussion because 

* his career isn't littered with awards (one Hart, one Art Ross, one Calder, five all-star games)
* his time spanned between the end of Gretzky/Lemieux and the beginning of Crosby/Ovechkin
* he never scored more than 30 goals (and that's usually what gets people's attention as a forward)
* he had a very short career (~700 games) because of his injuries
"
"Hasek has two Cup rings, as many as Mario Lemieux and Bobby Orr."
"I completely agree with all of this. A very well written, and detailed response fartswhenhappy. "
"Sure you can. Ken Dryden with 6 cups, 5 vezinas, 1 smyth, 1 calder in an 8 year career no less"
Yeah I mean I naively had Roy ahead of Hasek and Brodeur for many years.  Seemed like a no brainer.
"For the cups, you can't fault Hasek for not winning as much because that's a team accomplishment, one player can't win a cup.

As for the Conn Smythes, again if the team doesn't make the final, then a completely dominant player who was on that team but didn't make it out of the Conference Final can't win it, even if they were better than the player that does.

You can't add up awards and compare to see who's better. All you get is who has more awards.

Pretty silly to assume anyone who has a different opinion just isn't as informed as you. If we were going by that logic, I was a goalie for many years so my opinion must be better than someone's who wasn't. See how silly that is?"

"Life long Hawks fan since 2009.

Apparently too many NHLers were to young to remember when Hawks fans did not show up to games or care about the team at all."
You guys have amazing fans. Lots of bandwagoners in the past bit? Yeah. But every successful franchise in any sport has that
"almost *one third* of players said that, too. pretty cool"
"Toronto even ranking in the top 5 for this was a even biggest surprise. I'd bet those votes are from players in other teams who just recall noise levels, and not jerseys thrown on the ice."
"Meh, it’s an entirely different perspective for the players. Fan to fan interactions with hawks fans in my experience are usually pretty shit. Might be because I’m not in Chicago but often the ones I’ve met are pretty ignorant about the league outside their team. "

"Just last year he was a Vezina finalist, it’s not like he’s been garbage since 14-15"
"come on, the habs blow this year but he suddenly isn't total shit because he's bad this year. He and the rest of the team checked out ages ago."
I'd rather have Grubauer than price tbh
"Yeah, Lundqvist has been playing for 13 years behind some great, some terrible teams, and his lowest ever sv% is .910. That's the *worst* he's ever done in 13 seasons. That's nuts."
They have identical career save %'s. Henrik has been a bit more consistent but Price has had much better top seasons. His best is better than Henriks. 
"Price had one year better than Luongo and Lundqvist's best year. He's had 4 years worse than either of their worst years. 

And both Lundqvist and Luongo have also won olympic gold as a starting goalie, both playing behind teams that were far less dominant than the 2014 Canada team. "
"The Rangers were pretty bad for the first half dozen years of Lundqvist's career, and he dragged them kicking and screaming to the playoffs. They've also absolutely bled shots for the last few years, this year especially so. Luongo started his career with a bad Panthers team and has spent recent years with a pretty mediocre panthers team as well. His best season was with the Panthers early in his career on a team that finished 12th in the east. 

>Carey Price has really had to battle with some bad Montreal teams. And is routinely the best player on their team.

Substitute Lundqvist or Luongo and their teams in for this statement and it's just as accurate.

"
"I think the real greats like Gretzky, Lemieux would be fine in the modern era.  But the drop off as you went down the roster would be stark.  Guy 7 on their team probably wouldn't play."
I think you take most third liners now and put them on the ice in the 80s and they would blow people away. The general skill and fitness now vs then would be shocking.
"Yeah for sure - the game has evolved so much that it gets really difficult to compare between eras. You have to give some weight to era they played in - Gretzky obviously wouldn't be dropped 200p seasons all over the place in today's game. With that said, can you imagine Gretzky with modern training methods and equipment? His IQ was completely off-the-charts bananas, and that would shine through in any era. Same with Lemieux... imagine what he could do with modern training in a league where you weren't allowed to defend by trying to waterski off forwards. He's a rich man's Malkin and that's really saying something.

IMO the best bridge we have between eras is Jagr. Guy nearly won the Art Ross and Richard in 05-06 at 34, well past his prime. And he was *clearly* a few steps behind Lemieux and Gretzky.

Joe Sakic was another good bridge between eras. He was never on the same level offensively as any of the all time greats and he still dropped a 100p season in 06-07 at the age of 37."
"It would be interesting to see how modern players would've fared in the ""high scoring"" era, and how the guys from that era fared in the current era.
What kind of numbers does Ovi put up in say 92-93 when 14 players hit 50 or more. Does Adam Graves get anywhere near 50 post shutdown?"
"Athletically it's a no contest, but hockey sense than and hockey sense now are more or less the same thing. You can watch old games and be impressed by the skill of players even if it's half as fast and slapshots from the red line go in."
There's also the argument that they'd put up even sillier numbers considering all the hooking and holding going on back then. Mario in particular has highlight clip after highlight clip where he's going bar down with 3 guys literally skiing off the back off him.
But that's like comparing the wealth of someone without taking inflation into consideration.
Wouldn't that make McDavid the best ever then?
"Are you serious right now? It absolutely is outrageous to justify Crosby as the best forward ever. Gretzky had a level of domination never seen before in professional sports and likely never seen again.

If you're ignoring anything era related, then you're comparing a guy with:

2857 points, 9 Harts, 10 Art Ross, 5 Lindsay, 2 Smythe, 4 cups

vs.

1097 points, 2 Harts, 2 Art Ross, 3 Lindsay, 2 Smythe, 3 cups

In what planet are the two players even close to each other? It's not even close to being close. "
"And Luongo and Lundqvist haven't had any seasons nearly as bad as some of Price's. Luongo and Lundqvist have played longer, and been more consistent in their length than price has been in the amount he's played. Price has had one unbelievable season, and a few really good seasons. But to claim he's one of the best ever is a complete joke."
"But Luongo and Lundqvist have been playing for far longer, it is an unfair comparison."
The reason Lidstrom didn't have 90% of the vote is because he's nowhere near as good as Orr
"That too ""oh just go back out there its just a head boo boo youll be fine"""
Yah and I imagine those that can handle the demands would love him as a coach. Not everyone wants that though
And judging by cups is a fantastic measure of goalie skill. 
"One of them was Dougie Hamilton, guaranteed"
Huh. Good to know I'm still a shit curler on the world's best curling ice. 
I highly doubt McDavid had any input on the science side of how to make the ice but having one of the most gifted skaters in the NHL as a tester for different makeups would be valuable imo. Also it was probably a bit of PR on the Oilers side of things to say Connor helped improve the quality. 
"Not on making it, but he could test the finished product and tell them what was good about it and what they could change."

"I happened to attend a Detroit-Chicago playoff game a couple years ago.  You lost 4-1, btw.  (Sorry about that).

But what got me was that, for all the reputation the UC had, I didn't find it any louder when you went up 1-0 than I do a regular season Calgary-Edmonton game at the Saddledome.  It really surprised me, tbqh.   Of course, I never got a full picture of how loud the arena usually is, since Detroit proceeded to shit all over you for the rest of the game."
"Why do you feel like you have to yeell or scream to enjoy the game? It gets loud naturally for more exciting games, but not every game is going to get non-stop noise from the cloud depending on how the teams are playing."

No. He is hated a lot by all other fanbases. I like him, but this is just untrue. If anything his success in general is the biggest factor in the hatred, not your specific team losing to him."
Not agreeing or disagreeing but your argument that he's dirty rests solely on a video of <10 cheap shots throughout a 13 year career.. 
I don't think anyone considers him one of the dirtiest players in the league. A lot of players have a compilation like this for every season they play.

"I figured, from your comment and stuff. I definitely thought it was funny lol.

"I was at an airport (Dulles) a few months ago and ended up talking to a Blackhawks fan.  This guy *seemed* well-versed in the NHL, but said he couldn't name a single Capitals player outside of Ovechkin. 

Maybe he was more of a Blackhawks fan than a hockey fan, or maybe it was an East/West thing and he had little exposure to the Caps in general. Maybe it's the Ovechkin effect, as national coverage of the Capitals rarely reaches beyond #8.  Maybe he's just a busy guy.

Either way it was just a little disappointing.  

In retrospect, I guess I wouldn't expect my ""sometimes watches Caps games"" friend to know the Blackhawks' stars either."

That's not true.  While it is best overall, each team would rather win in regulation than go to overtime, especially because trying your best to win will make positive results more likely."
Teams will still do that because two points is better than zero points. 
"The issue with this is while it makes the last 5 mins of ties more exciting, it creates a huge gap in the standings way earlier on in the season which makes ENTIRE GAMES way less exciting earlier on because both teams have almost no chance of catching up in the standings.

I have no argument that Forsberg was a more dominant player. He was the best player in the league for 2-3 seasons. However I think Lidstrom health and longevity gives him an edge. Lidstrom was a top flight player for about 15 seasons where Forsberg was 5-7

"My point is that the players do know of him mostly because of his poor officiating. Then when asked to name a referee he is what comes to mind even if they don’t remember exactly why.

True.  Peel always has seemed like the perfect ref from the league's standpoint.  That's probably why he's in charge of training the younger ones.  Maybe it is a league problem and not a refereeing one.

In lots of situations that is true. You have first hand knowledge of how the position is played 

I don't necessarily disagree with everything else.

I just ask myself ""Which goalie would you want in the Cup final game 7 OT""

As for how they conduct themselves? People are people, every franchise has had their moment's of embarrassment. I'm biased of course, but Hawks surprised me it has to be a Canadian team we take this sport more seriously."
"That's not fair. Every fan base has idiot fans. I see so many Leafs fans who stuck by their team in the dark days, truly great fans imo. I definitely wouldn't consider the Habs fan base a bad lot if one or two decided to abandon their team out of frustration."
Can confirm.

"I'm just disagreeing with this:

> who have been every bit as good as Price for much longer

Two years ago Price went on a run that may have been the most impressive run by a goalie ever, and unmatched by any point of Lundqvist or Luongo's careers. Price was considered by most to be the best player in the league, an extremely rare achievement for a goalie (and never something said of Lundqvist or Luongo).

I can't find the article now but I read somewhere that if you adjust ovy's 65 goal season from 07-08 to the goal scoring levels of the 81-82 season when gretz put up his record 92, Ovy's total would be somewhere around 99 goals. People can form their opinions around that however they want, but I point it out to highlight that recency bias will always affect people's opinion of a player if they're still playing.

"Someone who is making the argument can make it by arguing in absolute player skill level (ignoring the limitations of the era). 

Think of it like we went back in time grabbed players and put all the best ones in a rink in their prime. I'd argue the more modern players would dominate - better training, better nutrition, advancement in sports science, etc. 

Also I liked how you flipped out over the fact I mentioned that something could be argued. "
"It's part of the circle jerk among media (not only Montreal medias) and players that Carey Price is the golden standard for goaltending nowadays. Add a bit of recency bias and you get the 4th best of all time. 

Agree with it or not, that's the result of a poll, it really means jack shit. I do think that if he can maintain his really good seasons level for the rest of his career he should be considered easily in the top 5 best of modern hockey with the likes of Brodeur, Roy, Lundqvist and Luongo... but that's going to be a tough ask with the garbage team Bergevin is putting in front of him XD.

But I can't imagine this result not being all a result of recency... if that poll was done 5 years ago instead of Price you would see Tim Thomas."
You overlook one important thing. Price has won an Olympic gold with Canada. Lundqvist has only done it with Sweden.
"Prices bad seasons were when he was an 18-19 yr old shoved into a larger role than he was ready for. He honestly should have spent time in the minors to develop longer, buts it’s obviously worked out for him in the end regardless. "
"And neither Luongo nor Lundqvist reached the peak that Price did. Not just one season either, Price's '14, '15, '16, and '17 seasons are unmatched by the other two on a 4 year run."
"When talking about the best players of all time, longevity is a consideration. Else Tim Thomas is better than all three of these guys. 

But I thought about that too, so in terms of opportunities (seasons not massively shortened by injury) the comparison looks like this. Price has done it 6 out of 10 opportunities. Luongo has done it 13 out of 15 opportunities. And Lundqvist has done it 11 out of 13 opportunities. This isn't purely a matter of them having played longer. "
And why do you think that? Is it because Bobby Orr is a Good Ontariyah Boy and Lidstrom is a Sissy Yurupian?
to be fair curling is fucking hard
"Taking career stats like that is completely irrelevant though. Obviously Brodeur and Roy are going to have more down years when they each played at least 300 games than Hasek.

Brodeur almost doubled his games in the NHL.

Roy was dominant at save percentage for a majority of his career and it's not fair to knock his stats down because Hasek got the extra time to cook over in Pardubice until he was 25 (Roy's worst two years were when he was 20 and 21).

If you recalculate that stat and start from when they were both 25, Roy blows everyone out of the water."

"That's what most want, yes. Every game is a three point game."
Correct. Each game has three points to allocate. Win em all in regulation or give one up to the team that took you to OT
"Yes obviously winning is still the goal, but the loser point makes it where not losing is more important than winning, essentially. From a game theory perspective, teams are encouraged to not take any large risks in the last several minutes of a game because getting the loser point is so valuable. This is brutally obvious in some games where D-men are making way more d to d passes to kill time, are less likely to pinch and join the rush, and even forwards end up playing the trap. "

...not how downvotes and upvotes work haha
Don't know why you are getting downvoted.  If I had to pick any goalie currently going forward I'd pick Price.  But this is based on assumptions that he's having a down year.  I think we see more of 14-15 Price but lundqvist has to be one of the most underrated goalies.  And yes I understand how well regarded he is but the dude dragged some mediocre and decent teams well beyond what they should have.  And he's been doing it his whole career.  How is Price considered a better goalie already?
Players aren't ranking other players and goalies on stats but on what they see when they play them. My guess is price is actually harder to score on compared to orhers because of his reflexes or positioning or something. Thus the votes. That's my guess at least since players see it from another perspective. 
"Carey Price had one season where he went .933 SV% which, while outstanding, isn't even close to the best run ever. 

Price, Luongo and Lundqvist have identical career SV% and yet Lundqvist has over 200 games on Price and Luongo over 400. The fact that those two have played at the same level as Price for that much longer is crazy."
"And the players all clearly respect him still as a top goalie and difficult player to go up against. He still does absurd shit this year but I really do think he has the chronic fatigue syndrome because he looks off.

If he can get over it, he'll go right back to normal. Outside of 6 weeks last year, Price's peak was absurd and lasted 4 seasons (2013-14 through 2016-17). If he comes back next year and goes back to his old self you can chop this to a down year and give him 6 seasons of arguably being the best goalie in the world. 

This sub has 180'd on him so fast. We've seen stars have down years all the time but to say Price has only had one good year is stupid. He was in the league a lot earlier than most goalies, of course it will impact his stats from the early seasons. "
">he’d be in Vezina consideration if not outright win. 

Don't sugar coat it, he *would* win. People might not want to hear it but goalies from that era sucked compared to modern NHL goalies. Anyone who plays the position at any level can see that."
"Yeah but they would be playing without waterproof pads, without modern goalie skates, they couldn't use any element of modern profly, they would have to t-slide laterally, etc. etc.

They'd have to completely rebuild their game"
All I see is a flawless specimen of skill and fitness. 
"Ken Dryden actually has a bit on this in his book The Game; he posits that players today are much more structured and trained in skill than before. And it's true, kids who make it in the NHL today have parents who spent thousands of dollars on extra training and summer camps and off ice an etc, etc. Basically, a shitload of skill development. Back in his day, players grew up playing endless (and I really mean endless) hours of pick up on the local ice during the winter. He has a good story about Guy Lafleur getting in to the Thurso arena every morning before the day started just to play around with the puck. 

The point is; back then players spent a lot of time playing hockey and developping a style, whereas today it's all skill based. I wouldn't doubt it if playing on the outdoor local rink would be considered a rare threat for elite kids today, god knows their schedule probably wouldn't allow it."
"They would also have worse skates, worse sticks, worse equipment, less powerplays, no TV timeouts, no sports science, worse medicine, no understanding of concussions, etc"
"""Absolute player skill"" is such a nebulous term that's impossible to define or measure, just like intangibles. It's an argument that can't be substantiated in any way other than gut feeling which isn't really productive for having any sort of conversation. 

If you want to be pedantic, everything *can* be argued, but some things are so lopsided that it's exceedingly difficult to put forth a reasonable argument. 

I *can* argue that Crosby is a better goal scorer than Ovechkin, but that doesn't mean I can put forth a reasonable or credible argument for that. It would be outrageous to argue that Crosby is a better goal scorer than Ovie, just like it's outrageous to argue Crosby is the best forward of all time."

Thats false

"If you don't consider longevity, Theodore would be in the top 5 for his Vezina season... I don't want that top 5, NO THANK YOU."
"A number of players seem to view the criteria in a different way.

That said, I would not put Price at 4th best overall either, and I feel those kind of rankings are better suited for when a players career is over.

Best seems to me as if it would be strictly based on skill which shouldn't really weight longevity."

"Given that Hasek wasn't in the NHL at 25, I'm sure Roy beats him... Hasek played fewer games, but they're all out of his first decade as a goalie.

(In case you weren't aware, Hasek started his pro career at 16 but he was behind the iron curtain until his mid 20's and then came over to Chicago who had Belfour, traded to Buffalo who had Coco iirc and only at about 28 iirc got a shot at being the #1 guy.)"

Pretty ridiculous statement. One of the highest SV% ever put up by a starter in one season, and despite being one of few goalies to ever win the Hart, got 139/167 first place votes.

And the fact that the Boston Globe thought he was Boston's greatest sportsman over the best hitter in the history of baseball and the greatest winner in the history of sports (Russell) shows how full of shit that rag is.

You're discounting changes in play that would happen in a 3-2-1 system. You'd see much more aggressive offence in the last few minutes of a tied game. Late in the season you'd see teams on the playoff bubble pull their goalie in a tied game to try to get 3 points.

The best run ever by a goalie has to be Hasek in the 90s when he won 6 of 8 Vezinas
"Price had 2013/14 and 2014/15 where he put up .927% and .933%, which is phenomenal. In the absence of any standout scorer, he deserved his Hart. He was definitely the best goalie for those two years.

Problem is, he played 10 games the next year. The year after he put up a .923%, which is still good, but not otherworldly good. 

Compare to, say, Dominik Hasek, who put up back-to-back-to-back seasons of .930%+, including a .937 SV% in 1998-99."
"Price is also younger than them. If he doesn't get hurt in 2015-16 then you could say he had two years. Last year was a good season as well where he was a vezina finalist. This year is a down year but if he comes back next year as the best then that could have been 4/5 seasons of being the best goalie in the league and looked at as a top 5-10 player, which is a higher peak than Hank and Luongo.

Obviously this is purely hypothetical and I'm not saying Price is better than them due to shit that didn't happen. But context is key. His prime isn't necessarily over yet so you can't compare him to two of the oldest and most storied goalies in the league before his story is finished. 

Price isn't above Hank/Luongo in terms of total career but his peak was higher and isn't necessarily over, so I can see the argument both ways."
"Thank you. He has arguably the highest peak of a goalie since Marty and was just as dangerous as the best in his peak which lasted years. That isn't a run, that's just being the best goalie in the world. "
"Sure, I can agree with that. My only serious point of contention is we have loads of data for players whose careers spanned across eras and it doesn't indicate nearly as much of a drop off as you might expect.

Joe Sakic in his prime put up a career high of 120p in 82 games in 95-96. In the same year Lemieux dropped 161p in just 70 games. So Lemieux was producing at about a 60% higher rate than a prime Sakic.

Joe Sakic also put up 100p in 82 games in 06-07 at the age of 37. This was the year where 19-year-old Crosby set his personal best of 120p in 79 games. So Crosby was producing at about a 25% higher rate than a near-retirement Sakic. I realize Crosby wasn't quite in his prime yet, but that's a much smaller margin of dominance than should be expected from the best player of all time compared to a great but not all-time legend player from the 90s.

I'm not seeing any reason why Sakic's production would remain so strong against modern competition if we're to believe that modern players are so much faster, stronger, more skilled than the old timers."
Is it exhausting being this shallow and insulting to people about something so casual and unimportant?
"Are you being willfully ignorant here? First of all, we only won 2 cups because Orr was plagued by injury and retired incredibly early.

Learn to think critically and not just circle jerk yourself to the point of saying dumb shit. It might make you look like less of an idiot. "
"You ever think that maybe Orr was so prolific offensively is because he constantly held the puck and never let the other team actually play offense? It's fine to think Lidstrom is the better defenseman than Orr, it's an absolutely justifiable position to take, but you just sound like a pimply ass fucking tool when you call Orr a terrible defenseman"
Probably just ignore this guy. Likes to engage in weird inflammatory arguments all the time because he loves being a contrarian. 
"> And Orr never, ever played defense once in his career.

This is how I can tell you've never actually watched a game that Orr played.  Anyone who says this and claims to have watched him is either blind or stupid.

Orr won the Norris more than Lidstrom ever did, and I highly doubt that he would have won it more if he wasn't Swedish.  A lot of people argue that Lidstrom only won the Norris in 2011 based on his reputation as well."
"> ""No. He is hated a lot by all other fanbases...""

If you took that to mean he is hated by every person of every fan-base, then that's on you haha. You are being disingenuous about what I said just to argue, and you know it.

I argued against your notion that a Preds fan would question Crosby being best role model because he beat us in the Finals (talk about an asinine statement). I did it with a civil comment, and in yours you decided to talk to me like an idiot for some reason... and then you couldn't read so you got even *more* defensive.

"> Forsburg was a way better player and it's really not even close.

Its Forsberg. 

Nah, dude, Lidstrom is literally top 3 best defenseman of all time. Smartest guy on the ice, put up tons of points, near perfect positioning, hand eye coordination and rarely fucked up his entire career. He made everyone he was paired with better (ie. Ian White being a legit top line guy and having a career year beside him). "

You're cherry picking and being irrational. 
"Orr was an offensive weapon. His junior coach said he played him at defenseman to get him more minutes and told him to play like a top winger.

Orr often led the Bruins rush, most defensemen don't do that because their primary responsibility is to get back on defense. So unless there were two Bobby Orrs on the Bruins in the 70s, there was only one player who was always leading the rush and was never, ever back on defense.

There's a difference between Erik Karlsson, who plays like a defenseman, and Bobby Orr, who was deployed as a forward. Orr was the primary puck handler in breakout, neutral zone and offensive zone situations. Since he was always down low in the offensive zone, he wasn't back on defense when the puck went the other way."
"Orr always led the Bruins rush when he played. Which is fine, he was an offensive weapon who should've been leading the Bruins rush, but that means when you're up on the rush, you aren't back on defense. 

In his own zone, Orr wasn't the defenseman retrieving the puck, he was the defenseman that was responsible for moving the puck, whether by skating it out of the zone or making a breakout pass, when his partner, who did the work of getting the puck back, got it to him. That's because Orr was, as he was always deployed, an extra forward. He was better than even Paul Coffey at that role.

So saying Orr wasn't there to defend (he wasn't) isn't blind or stupid, it's how his coaches used him. They used their time with him to refine his offensive skills and wanted him to lead the rush, make plays down low in offensive zone situations and be the primary puck handler in breakout, neutral zone and offensive zone situations.

By contrast, Lidstrom was deployed as a defender first and everything else he did was secondary. That's fine, too.

As for Lidstrom losing out on the Norris due to his country of origin? From 1998-2000, he lost out to players he was obviously better than that year by virtue of them being born in North America. It happened in 1997 to Vladimir Konstantinov, too."

I'm downvoting you to prove your point.
"I'm trying to find a way to compare players today to players 30+ years ago. I agree that players today have gotten faster, the equipment has gotten better, their conditioning has improved tremendously - I don't agree that this automatically makes the best hockey player of this era (Crosby) better than the best hockey player of a previous era (Lemieux, Gretzky). Personally, I think this has a much bigger impact on the lower end player - I think 3rd and 4th liners today are significantly better than 3rd/4th liners 30 years ago. I don't think that same level of improvement necessarily carries over to elite players because so much of this game is hockey IQ and pure skill.

I'm trying to find a comparison between eras by looking at players who careers bridged the gap. I'm trying to show that elite hockey players do well in any era and that Lemieux and Gretzky were so much better than everyone around them that they'd still clearly be the best today. If you don't like Sakic, look at Jagr. If you don't like Jagr, look at Selanne. If you don't like Selanne, look at Forsberg. 

If you think I'm cherry picking - give me counter examples that show I'm wrong. If I'm being irrational - call me out on what part of my argument is irrational."
"You're still going, huh?  Quote from [Red Fisher from the Montreal Gazette](http://montrealgazette.com/sports/why-bobby-orr-is-simply-the-best).  Extremely well-respected journalist who actually saw Orr play a lot:

>“Orr is the best hockey player I have ever seen, offensively and defensively. He was somethin’ else,” Red told me a couple of days ago. “He’d carry the puck all the way to the other blue line and if for some strange reason he lost the puck, he was waiting for you by the time you came to his blue line with the puck. Not only was he the best two-way player, he was also certainly one of the five toughest guys and among the top five fighters in the league when he had to.

>“When people ask me about Orr and what made him so great, all I tell them is that I only saw the guy 14 times a year, plus the playoffs, but he pulled me out of my seat more than any player I ever watched,” added Red, who ranks Gretzky No. 2 and Lemieux No. 3. “I don’t have any beef with anybody who picks Gretzky first or Lemieux second, but as far as I’m concerned, Orr is the best I’ve ever seen and he always will be.”

Orr's insane speed meant that he would always be first back playing defense if the puck was ever lost.  He could skate circles around the players of those days, and that always showed on the backcheck.  He wasn't afraid to go into the corners or fight his way out of situations.  The idea that Orr was a glorified forward is ridiculous."

No way I'm spending any more time on you thanks though. 
"So this was part of an article from 2013, Red Fisher at that point would've been 77 years old. I'm doubting his memory on this one. Nobody's saying Bobby Orr wasn't tough, or that he wasn't a great player. But I sincerely doubt that any player is a good enough skater to win a race where the other guy starts in the neutral zone and he starts below his own goal line and gets there.

Could Orr do what he did if both guys were in the neutral zone? Of course he could. He could lose the puck at the blue line and win a foot race back to the other blue line. Could he do that if he was below the goal line? No. That's impossible."
Ok.
"[Backes suspended three games](http://md-akc.med.nhl.com/mp4/nhl/2018/03/07/70630f37-a0cd-4d68-bc94-603df7a538cc/1520451479571/asset_1800k.mp4)

^^^issues? ^^^contact ^^^/u/pacefalmd"
David Backes has been awarded not having to step foot in the United center.
"Can't complain about the NHL taking headshots seriously but that's definitely higher than I expected.

He did leave his feet and was late. Video did a good job."
"I didn’t actually see the hit, but I’m assuming we’re mad about this ruling as that’s kind of our thing"
"Surprised he got 3 games.

But at the same time the hit was late and not necessary."
Still trying to figure out why Hornqvist got nothing on his hit to the head on McAvoy.  
The wheel has spoken
"🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿 

Take One^"
That seems excessive imo. I didn't think he'd get any more than the max fine. 
Honestly I’m not mad. It was a bad hit and you cannot have these types of hits in the league. It sucks its 3 games but player safety is more important 
[Heres](https://streamable.com/aoc6c) the hit
"About as impartial as can be here - Bad hit, good suspension.

Lack of suspension for Horny is the elephant in the room though. Inconsistency for sure. "
Yet Hornqvist didn’t get suspend for his hit on McAvoy? The wheel of DoPs strikes again 
"I'm surprised based on Backes' history. But don't hit someone in the fucking head, and don't hit someone who doesn't have the puck."
"He’s played 848 career games. He plays a hard physical game. Always has. Has never been fined or suspended. EVER. And he gets 3 games for that. 

Okay..."
"What is the maximum someone with no prior offenses has been suspended? 

The hit definitely called for supplemental discipline, but just wondering if someone with 0 fines and 0 suspensions has ever had this heavy of a suspension before"
Ahhhhhhhhh......The inconsistency of the DoPS strikes again.
"The guy they use to narrate these is going to make them age hilariously, it already sounds like a guy from some workplace safety training video from 1997. In twenty years I think these videos will be kind of fun to watch, not any with really bad injuries of course but I can imagine them feeling like they're older than 2018."
"Looks like Backes took the three game suspension part of the Rat Trick in last night's game.  (A Rat Trick is when Marchand scores 3 goals and gets a 3 game suspension.)

I declare a RAT TRICK!"
"I'm surprised at 3, but it was a dumb hit."
*eye twitches slightly*
Was Backes a repeat offender from his time in St Louis? If he wasn't this doesn't seem like the right call...
"It's a Bruins player, he MUST be suspended."
Bruce Cassidy's next man up!
It was a bad hit and he probably deserved a game. 3 games for a guy who has never been fined or suspended before seems excessive. 
this would NEVER happen in MMA
WHEEL
"I think that is a fair suspension, hit in the head and the fact that it was so late just made it worse.

It seemed like he had plenty of time to avoid dishing out the hit, the puck was already on Pastrnak's stick before he had even initiated the hit..

Edit: To the people downvoting me saying that this is fair. I'm with you other Bruins fans that think that you have gotten shafted by the DoPS before when it includes your players getting hit. I'm only commenting on this specific hit with this and that is where I feel like the level should be when it comes to suspensions, which obviously means that I think the McAvoy incident for example should've warranted a disciplinary action of some sort."
Hopefully this suspension wakes him up
"Was it high? Yes.  Was it late? Yes.  Did he deserve to be suspended? Yes. I'm okay with this.  It didn't really feel like it was that bad of a hit at the time, and I actually felt as if Frans was trying to draw a major call.  However, during the replays, it really works worse.  "
"He hasn’t been fined or suspended in 800 games and the guy gets suspended for 3 games? He plays a physical game and hasn’t gotten suspended yet so I think I’d give him the benefit of the doubt that he just made a mistake. I was thinking there would be a fine but you wack him for 3? If he didn’t hurt Nielsen there wasn’t going to be a penalty never mind a 3 game suspension, they didn’t call it until after the whistle and saw the replay"
oh
"not trying to be a homer here......but what does everyone else think of the DoPS this year, i think its been all over the place. I dont understand how this is a 3 gamer...."
Hardly surprised.
I'm really liking our plan of resting our best players before the playoffs. 
Fucking joke
"So now we're without Bergeron, McAvoy, and Backes.  Tuukka getting healthy meant someone else had to be out :/

Also, interference causing injury is now three games?  Since when?  Backes has no fines or suspensions, so this doesn't make sense to me."
"Aaaand Hornqvist doesn’t even get a hearing. The officiating is a joke this year, and so is player safety. "
3/5s as bad as Marchand's brutal flying elbow? 
"Serious question: is it a thing to give out more harsh suspensions to a team that has multiple offenses? Like Marchand getting 5 earlier in the season and then Backes coming in with a late hit now, could it be possible since it’s the same team there a little bit extra to try and promote cleaner play? "
It's unbelievable how under the radar Backes has gone his entire career as a dirty player. Does being an Olympian count that fucking much? 
Way to be consistent DOPS!
What a joke 
Wheel of Punishments
"Whaaaaat that's insane for a hit that happens 50 times a game, it was so small just flipped him on the chin when he tried getting out of the way."
"Not sure I really get this one, but the will of the wheel is the will of the wheel

Won’t question it beyond that. "
"Gotta love a hit that didn't get called in real time and only got called after the Bruins had a missed chance deserves a three game suspension. Seriously, go back and watch the play, it's only called after the refs blew the play dead when the player didn't get up. Not when the Bruins had possession, not when the Bruins nearly scored. Yet a call that was only made retroactively deserves three games. Wanna call a game for a head hit? Sure. It's still wildly inconsistent for a whole laundry list of reasons, but fine. But three games? Yeah no, fuck off with that. The NHL seriously needs to fix their punishment system. "
Excellent and fair suspension. Backes went out of his way to hit Frans. 
"Would have happily accepted a game or a big fine for backes if hornqvist copped something similar for a very similar act. 

Inconsistency, DoPS, etc etc"
"Yes it was late and not very good, but I don’t think he shoulda gotten 3 games. Not to mention McAvoy caught the people’s elbow in the face the other day without anything"
"So, per the video - if Pastrnak isn't there to intercept the pass, the hit by Backes is somehow not late, or not as late.

That's some insane logic right there."
Bullshit
"Another set of bullshit from DoPS. Hornqvist can drill McAvoy in the face, but Backes barely taps Frans and it's three games. Suck my balls, DoPS."
"What a joke, no history and that has to be one of the softest hits for a suspension ever"
[deleted]
"Wow, first time in his career he won’t play the Blackhawks in a season. That may actually be tough for the ex-Blues Captain :/ "
So we won't get to see Backes rip Seabrook's head off? Damn shame
I would love if the refs would have to do that kind of video after every goalie interference decision. It would at least let us all know why the decision was made. 
"We are fanatics so there is some limit in our ability to act rationally about incidences, particularly those that involve the striped fellows. "
"meh, 3 games seems kind of appropriate for this hit."
He knocked Nielsen out for most of last night's game and at least 2 more...so it's fitting
"I'm also surprised at the 3 games, but this seems like the kind of hit that can be used as an example of exactly what kind of hit is unacceptable in the league. Nielsen wasn't skating with his head down and got popped, and he didn't make a last minute adjustment that caused the head contact. It's simply an extremely late, and high hit, which might be used as an example in future situations.

Still, even though I hate that hit, I don't think it was worth more than 1 game."
I would have been fine with 1 but 3 seems steep.
Because Hornqvist plays for the Penguins
"Horny shoulda gotten a game for sure, but this hit was worse than his.  McAvoy was low and it was a quick hockey play.  This was slow, well after the play and completely unnecessary, non hockey play.  I figured this would be 1 or 2 games after Horny getting away with nothing, so 3 seems a tad bit excessive, but let's just get these hits out of the game so I'm ok with it."
"Because it was a shoulder to shoulder check that wasn't even late?

Edit: there's no conversation to be had here, Boston homers are spamming downvotes on anyone who disagrees."
"Because when players put themselves in dangerous positions people who hit them don’t get suspended. 

[No penalty, fine or suspension](https://youtu.be/UvS6sWdiOUA)

[No penalty, fine or suspension](https://youtu.be/BJkffjoG0EE) 

It’s the same as when players turn towards the boards at the last second and then get plaster from behind. Keep your head up kids. "
Let it go dude. The fact that you are trying to compare will just make it worst for your fan base.
Because keep your head up is the first thing you get taught?  I thought the Bruins were supposed to be big and bad but based on yall reactions to a rookie getting punished for a rookie move yall have gone pretty soft eh?
🍿 Extra salt please!
🍿🥤🛋
Got some seasoning?
💥🌽
You'll need a lot of that since your season won't extend past mid April.
"Considering he has never been suspended in his previous 800 games, yeah I think it's excessive."
Same! I’m honestly pretty shocked
"I'm mad the inconsistency of the NHL, I'm not mad at the suspension itself."
"If player safety was a real concern, these kinds of unnecessary hits would be penalized much more heavily. A lateral hit right on the chin induces serious rotational acceleration on the brain, which is known to be the BEST way to cause a concussion. I would love to see an NHL where bad head hits are 10 games at a minimum. These are professional hockey players, they know what they are doing and where they are hitting their opponents.

The real tragedy is that after the bad hits he's taken recently, you'd think he'd have some empathy in regards to targeting the head."
"Wow, non delusional Bruins fans. Nice to meet you extremely rare people!  Upvotes for everyone!"
Doesnt excuse this. 
"That wasn't a late hit.

Edit: Alright /r/hockey, [notice the distance between the two players as the puck is leaving McAvoy's stick](https://i.imgur.com/2H8c2OE.png). 

Now [look at the distance between Forsberg and Vesey as the puck leaves Vesey's stick](https://i.imgur.com/nwIZCBM.jpg). This subreddit imploded when Forsberg was suspended. 

And finally, the [distance between Backes and Nielsen](https://i.imgur.com/y5labtc.png). 

In order of lateness: Backes>>>>Forsberg>Hornqvist



"
"This sub was all over Burrows saying he deserved every game he got when other guys like Marchand who actually have suspensions that get considered as history when they make the judgement got less. I see no reason why another player with no history shouldnt get more. 

Hell I think this should be done more often to anyone and I think guys like Marchand who refuse to lose should be getting 15+. I dont see why Torres got the harsh suspension as a lesson but guys like Marchand keep getting away with relatively light ones. I didnt even pick Marchand for my point as he was a Bruin. I just think they should be penalizing everyone more harshly and he is a prime example of someone who could use it."
"""No history of misconduct"" doesn't mean ""free pass for dirty hits"". It means there's no reason for additional punishment on top of what the play in question demanded. 

3 games is the right call. That check wasn't just a hard hit that got a little out of hand. Even if it had been clean (in terms of the contact and such) it still would've been a penalty. He's going after a player way outside the play and targeting his head. You can see Nielsen isn't at all prepared to take a hit, because there's no reason to expect one in that situation. Backes didn't even start winding up the hit before the puck was already gone. That's an inteitonal and malicious foul."
"Frankly, after 848 games of playing clean, he should know better than to make a stupid hit like that. 

It's a pretty rough suspension, but no one should be upset about the NHL cracking down on those dishing out serious head injuries given what we know these days about the effects of concussions."
"Just as Hornqvist wasn't suspended for a bad hit, Backes has never been suspended for his history of bad hits:

Nyquist got a bunch last season
"I can't help but think back to a certain hit on Backes

In the exact same spot

On a very similar play

hmmmmmmm"
Clean history with the DoPS
never fined or suspended by the league with over 800 games played until now.
True. They are definitely dirty. Surprised it took him so long in a B jersey to throw that hit. :) 
"It was a dirty hit to the head... he SHOULD be suspended.

You guys got the benefit of the doubt in 2011 so I'm not sure there is much room to complain here. "
OF
Bad joke
">If he didn’t hurt Nielsen there wasn’t going to be a penalty never mind a 3 game suspension

Well obviously? If the hit *didn't* hurt him then the hit itself would probably not have been as bad as it was. Seems pretty self explanatory?"
Who cares if he played 8 or 800 or 8000.  
"The DoPS needs to start handing out bigger suspensions across the board if they are serious about protecting the players.  3 games for this is just fine.  If anything it should be more just like all suspensions should be more, but given that people are losing their minds over 3 games I don't think they could move that fast."
"I think 2-3 games is fair for a hit like this, since they're trying to get this out of the game. The problem is that the punishments for similar incidents have been all over the place this season (as you said).

This just leads to a situation where everyone can point to an incident/punishment that confirms their opinion on this incident. "
"Best year in a long time. This is a bit excessive by 1-2 games but better more than less. There's a couple weird decisions (Dustin Brown's non-suspension *and* suspension were both the wrong calls, imo... Forsberg suspension was like wat?) otherwise I think they're doing the right things."
It’s a super late hit and he launched into Nielsen’s head
I think they are finally giving longer suspensions and I like that
I am it was a bit late but a first time offence come on. also it looks a lot worse when you slow it down at normal speed it looked like he barely got him
"Very late interference

Left feet

Head contact

One game for each seems fair."
"No, it's not a bounty system kind of thing.  It is an individual player decision.  However, there are teams, yes the Bruins, who have way worse reputation and is often earned.  We have had our fair share of dirty players and shitty plays.  But you can't hold an asshole teammate against a clean player who makes a mistake."
Typical Devils fan
Jerry this is the first time I can remember agreeing with you. He was such a dirty player for the Blues and everyone turned a blind eye.
No one cared until he went to Boston.
"Their punishment system is fucked up, I agree. But shouldn't the DoPS, henceforth known as DOPES, at least partially be there to level punishment for illegal hits that both were and weren't called? I don't know if there should be a sliding scale for calls that were missed or not. If it's a dirty/bad hit I think the DOPES should be able to level fines/punishment without factoring in whether the player got a penalty. "
"I agree with most everything you said but one thing you have to consider is maybe the 2 refs didn't see it clearly and refer'd to the linesmen after the fact.  Its something I wish they did more often as long as they don't kill the pace of the game.

Regardless, it was still deserving of a penalty and a fine or a single game suspension.  3 games is probably a little excessive for someone with a ""clean"" history but the biggest problem IMO is consistency.

"
"There's been plenty of examples of players getting suspended and fined without a penalty even getting called. If you think that's a reason to not suspend someone, because the refs didn't blow the whistle soon enough, then it would be a free for all behind the refs every game."
"He didn't go ""out of his way"" but he certainly could have held up and skated by him.  He was clearly initiating contact and anticipating him taking that pass."
"They used the fact that Pastrnak had the puck simply to illustrate how late the hit was. Nowhere in the video did they make a point that the hit was late specifically because Pastrnak had the puck. The only thing they looked at, or that matters, is how long ago Frans got rid of the puck relative to when he was hit. 

>That's some insane logic right there.

Irony."
I think they were using Pastrnak only to demonstrate how late the hit was - that he had enough time to gain possession and start driving into the zone.
"McAvoy had his head down and was playing the puck. Bad hit yes, but it was a clean play."
"Bruh, I've watched two of my favorite players of all time have their careers cut short from bad hits.  I don't think the perspective thing works against us."
Tommy Wingels will step up and hopefully get 2 against his former team.
Damn that's crazy to think he won't play us this year. But I'm sure he'll make up for it next year by throwing 10 hits each game
He got him right in the face.. I dont see why this is being downvoted.
Damn the Bruins fans are becoming the worst.. VERY FAST.. just by watching this thread.. They are delusional.
He was back 5 minutes later in the same period. Stop lying.
"Just weird that they crack down on the guy who [took this hit, which didn't get a call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5AJCquW9XU)"
Most of the suspensions this year have been longer than in past years
"Yea, I am not defending any head shot or hit from behind. People on here justifying certain hits to the head where none should be at all. "
His nose literally had an extra hole. It was not shoulder to shoulder.
Um what?!? You must be thinking of a different hit
"Hornqvist started going for the hit long after McAvoy's head was down, so he either intentionally hit him there or extremely recklessly hit him there, neither of which should excuse him."
The first one should have warranted a suspension as he was the second guy in throwing a hit to a guy that was already down. Second one seemed like a shoulder on shoulder. [Not at all the same as this](https://youtu.be/F1yfXjKXTVc?t=6s) 
"If the situation were reversed, you’d be crying about it. I guarantee it. "
Vancouver salt is the best. 
Oh normally the Salt in these suspension threads works just fine. 
only white cheddar 🙄
Not just regarding Backes but every player who plays on the edge has gotten away without hearings or fines.  It makes it seem that much crazier when the DOPS finally wakes up and hands down harsher suspensions.  In a fair world Backes would've at least had past phone calls from DOPS (as would many others) and there'd be a base of information to build suspensions on.  Now everything seems excessive because DOPS has been so inconsistent.
Valid point 
Yeah judging by the downvote they just proved you 100% right.
Consistency would be nice though.
They didn't say it did. It's infuriating to see such inconsistency.
Never said it did. 0 consistency from DoPs
"But this wasn't that bad at all, and purely accidental.....the other was a direct head shot"
Either you’re dumb or you haven’t seen the hit but I’m going with both in this case. 
"As a neutral fan who didn't see any of the hits, is this not a fair assessment?"
"Doesn't the DOPES look at history when determining suspensions/fines, though? "
"Sorry, which of those were bad hits?

First one was completely clean shoulder to chest, no head contact. At worst, it was *slightly* late.

Second one wasn't NHL so it wouldn't matter for any sort of historical purposes.

Third one was a borderline penalty, but he had just passed the puck and you could argue he was expecting a hit so he reverse checked.

Fourth one was another borderline penalty but nothing dirty.

Fifth one can't tell based on angle.

Sixth one was a penalty, but it wasn't dirty and wasn't with an intent to inure the guy. He went into the boards to fight for a puck and in the process boarded a guy and got 2 minutes for it.

Backes is no saint, and has taken plenty of dumbass penalties and has done some dirty shit in his career that maybe warranted a suspension, but none of these are good examples for whatever case you're trying to make.

It's like you googled ""David Backes penalty"" to try and make a case for him being dirty...
"
"Ah, good call, looks like that was 6 with no history. Although a much more egregious offense"
[For reference this got 0 games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5AJCquW9XU)
🤔
"I keep seeing people bringing that up.  Don't mean to tee off on you specifically but does everyone who brings up ""800 games no history "" not understand that number of games played prior to this suspension worthy hit has nothing to do with how long he should be suspended? It means diddly squat that if he played 8 or 800."
Thank you for excusing us for something that happened 7 years ago. 
FORTUNE
CHEESE!!!
Well I thought it was funny.
Who said this again? Was it Backes or was it someone about Backes? 
So by that logic if somebody gets hurt on a 100% clean hit there should be a penalty just because there was an injury? I’m not arguing it was a bad hit I’m saying 3 games is way too much.
">The DoPS needs to start handing out bigger suspensions across the board if they are serious about protecting the players.

Then the NHLPA needs to renegotiate."
They have been giving longer suspensions this year I think. I dont have the data to back it up but there have been a lot of longer ones
But when you jump into a hit and only get his head that isn't gonna go over well. DoPS certainly isn't consistent but I would prefer to see them come down on the hard side for head contact.
"The direct head contact to McAvoy a few games ago didn't even get a look, so I'm not really buying that the league is taking head contact more seriously"
And I don’t think you should hold everyone accountable for the actions of one. 3 games seems excessive so I was wondering if it had any ties to the previous suspension. 
I’m seriously asking a question. Just trying to understand the game better. 
"On behalf of the STL Blues, we would gladly take him back. We've got a like-new Bouwmeester to throw in as well. "
I guess I disagree. 
"We can only hope, FLY, WINGELS, FLY! "
And punching Toews in the back of the head every chance he gets. 
"Becoming the worst?  We are the worst atleast once a year.  When it's not us its philly, when its not philly, its montreal and the rotation goes on to pitt and chicago.  Simply our turn for the trashy fans to rise up."
Same thing happened with Marchands blatant elbow. 
[Red Wings calling up Evgeny Svechnikov with Frans Nielsen sidelined at least 2 games.](https://twitter.com/HeleneStJames/status/971506463645544448)
Are you fucking retarded?  He played 5 minutes and averages nearly 16.  He never came back out of the locker room.
YOU STOP LYING.. He was out of the fucking GAME.. DONT LIE.. I know its hard for you.. 
"I totally get it, because that's absolutely brutal. I guess the *only* redeeming things about that hit is that it wasn't super late and his feet stay on the ground, but holy hell, that's literally targeting the head. 

Considering Ritchie could've delivered just as effective of a hit if he simply went shoulder to chest, it's tough to watch, and a stupid decision on his part.

I wish the DoPS would release videos explaining why players *didn't* get suspended as well as why they did. I feel like that would help players (and coaches/fans) understand even more."
That should never be the basis for punishment.
"* Ritchie initiated the contact while Backes had the puck.

* Shoulder to shoulder hit

* Feet stayed on the ice

Was it a blindside hit? Sure? Should it have been called? I mean, it does deserve at least a minor. Was it as bad at Backes' hit on Nielsen? Absolutely not!"
"You realize head contact on the follow-through is legal, right?  That was a perfectly clean hit and backes got smoked because he wasn't paying attention."
Did you watch either of the links I posted? It doesn’t matter. Precedent shows that if you put yourself in a dangerous situation the DoPS doesn’t care. It isn’t a suspendable play in their eyes. 
"> The first one should have warranted a suspension

But it didn’t. And Ruhwedel got a concussion from it as opposed to McAvoy who barely missed a shift. So you don’t really have a leg to stand on calling for Hornqvist to be suspended. "
Well it has happened to a penguin and [the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/6c7mk3/bobby_ryan_takes_out_chad_ruhwedel_with_a/) was full of people saying it was on Ruhwedel for being bent over. 
Negative.
"Damn, was hoping you had top cheddar"
I think the DOPS has been WAY better this year personally. Longer suspensions for more dirty plays.
My first real downvotes. I feel so loved. Does this make me part of the reddit family? Thanks Bawhston!
"Regardless of if it was accidental or not, you should not allow yourself to get into a situation where you can make contact with someone else's head, otherwise you have to face the consequences. While I'm sure Backes didn't mean for it to be dangerous, he should've known that Nielsen didn't have possession and was away from the play in addition to having his stick up and coming close to his head."
"Username either checks out or you're just an idiot, I can't quite tell. "
"Even your Captain said the Horny hit wasn't dirty 

🤷‍♂️ 

No skin off my back either way. It's just hilarious that the top comment by a Bruins fan isn't to admit the hit was bad - but to deflect to another team. "
Are you serious? Not even your homer announcers thought it was late. Look at the distance between Hornqvist and McAvoy at the moment the puck leaves McAvoy's stick.
"Boston fans have just gone downvote happy because they feel like they’ve been slighted for some reason. 

Even though the Hornqvist hit played no role in Backes hitting someone and Hornqvist being suspended does nothing for the Bruins. "
"""Backes is no saint, and has taken plenty of dumbass penalties and has done some dirty shit in his career that maybe warranted a suspension, but none of these are good examples for whatever case you're trying to make.""

You just agreed with the case I'm making. He's a dirty player with a history of injuring players with questionable hits. Just because he hasn't been suspended prior to this shouldn't give him the benefit of the doubt on this play. He knew where he was skating, he's a professional."
"It didn't even get looked at. The DoPS just ignored it. People ask why we hate the DoPS, this is why."
"That hit is should on shoulder, and not as late."
"Honestly I wouldnt expect them to suspend for that when kadri got nothing for an even harder blindside hit on Sedin last year. I do wish they would call blindsides though.

This hit didnt make first contact with the head though and I imagine thats what they look at"
"Wow its like the person hitting didnt even take one stride after puck left stick and didnt hit him the head, HOW IS THAT NOT A SUSPENSION."
I will admit Ritchie does a lot of stupid shit but that hit doesn't deserve a suspension. Might be a tad late but its shoulder to shoulder.

Thank you for complaining about a dirty hit getting a suspension from this year.
"You were in the negatives, so I was trying to draw the attention to the fact that it was a joke

Also, bad joke as in a groaner dad joke"
"No, they're saying that the specific hit he gave was what injured the player, and that's why they're being suspended for it."
"No because I'm talking in the context of this specific hit, where it was late and hit him in the head."
"Renegotiate for what?  The NHLPA is always on the side of the guy getting suspended, and the owners don't want to hand a serious suspension to a star.  "
"There have been a few that seemed higher than normal, I hope the trend continues."
Because the head contact on McAvoy was caused by him cutting through the ice staring at his skates.  Backes had to jump to make sure he made head contact.
They review everything
I absolutely love him. He's living up to his contract this year. He's so versatile and fits in well. Keep your gloves off him. 
I'm guessing Acciari is gonna be 4C and Kuraly 3C?

I hate that I'm a hypocrite for liking that so much, cuz if it happened to one of our guys I'd be livid. "

Did I say he wasn’t going to be sidelined? Don’t say he was taken out of most of the game when he came back for his next shift.
">  that's literally targeting the head

This is literally the worst use of the word literally I've seen in a while. That check should've been a penalty, but the initial point of contact is shoulder-to-shoulder."
"Try to ignore my flair, but I actually don’t see the head contact on this hit. I definitely agree that Ritchie is, in general, a stupid hot head that makes some extremely stupid hits (last year in the game when we were eliminated from the playoffs comes to mind), but I just don’t see how this hit is even worth a penalty, let alone a suspension. He was definitely in the window of finishing a hit (the very tail end of it, I guess you could argue it was late enough for a penalty) and it was shoulder to shoulder. Elbow stayed down and feet stayed on the ice. If someone could show me the headhunting I would be willing to change my mind"
"I agree, it can however be frustrating to see the inconsistentcy "
What kind of crack are you smoking? and are you willing to share with the rest of us?
You are not a smart person
But 3 games for someone with no history?
You think backes targeted his head? 
"Even if the hit was late it wasnt even close to suspension worthy, 2 mins charging thats about it."
"My point was your ""evidence"" that he's a dirty player is all bullshit.

>  He's a dirty player with a history of injuring players with questionable hits. 

Citation needed, because none of your videos above proves this point, and having watched a majority of his professional career I'd say he was frequently borderline, I'm surprised he was never suspended before now because the league is finally starting to crack down, but he's certainly not Brad Marchand levels of dirty."
Because a shoulder-on-shoulder hit took Backes by surprise?  That hit isn't even really late.  If you think these two hits are equal your homer glasses are prescription strength.
Wrong.
Maybe when trying to show dirty hits by a player your first link shouldn't be a terrible call. Backes got a match penalty for a clean check to a guy's chest and they called it a head shot. Not even two minutes.  
"No hearing or supplemental discipline though, for a direct hit to the head where the player was injured. "
"I have no idea. 

Marchand - R. Nash from Canada - Pastrnak 
DeBrusk - Krejci - R. Nash from Canada 
Heinen - Wingels - Gionta 
Schaller - Kuraly - Acciari 

Maybe? Wingels, Schaller, Acciari have all been centers at some point, don’t know about in the league though 
"
"That's an incident where the best way I can explain how I feel is  from a quote from ""Watchmen"". 

""Without condoning or condemning, I understand."" "
What's that supposed to prove? 
No he didn't.. STOP LYING. 
On Backes/Nielsen or Backes/Ritchie?
"It's really hard to tell between whiplash and head contact. I think since Ritchie is a big dude, and Backes was in an athletic stance, the contact *may* have started in his chest/shoulder, but since Ritchie's shoulder was up so high, it caught his chin and popped his head back. Tough to tell."
I’m not the one ignoring evidence and precedent because muh feels
"I agree it's excessive, but at least one game is warranted. Unfortunately I think Backes got caught in the situation of them having to set a precedent."
I believe they are referring to the fact you say it’s not that bad
"Both were late, both were blind side, and both made head contact.

Hmmmmmmm..."
"yeah I;m struggling to see the issue with this hit. In slow mo you see he goes through him ass to shoulder, elbow tucked in with his feet on the ice the whole time. "
Username checks out
agreed
Boston....homer glasses....noooooo........
No u
Blindside late hit that injured a player. Just because they called it a headshot when it wasn't doesn't excuse his history of bad hits. 
Saying McAvoy was injured is a but much he had a cut nose and was out the next shift. His injury came in the next game.
Do you think there should have been a suspension?
Yeah that's pretty much it. A lot of people aren't able to comprehend when I say I can understand someone's motivations for something without approving or disapproving it. 
It's not supposed to prove anything. I was just dropping it by in hopes that it would get a video response of Backes punching Toews in the back of the head.
Backes/Ritchie. There is no initial head contact
Lol gotcha. Not bad
"Ritchie wasn't late and he came in shoulder on shoulder, that's on Backes for admiring his shot.  There wasn't head contact made on that hit either, unless you've got another angle, that was clearly shoulder on shoulder."
"One was significantly later than the other. Both are blind-side, but blind side hits are only illegal if they're targeted at the head. The head contact in that hit was secondary at best while it was the principal point of contact in Backes' hit. 

I'm not calling either a clean hit, but Backes's hit is leagues above in terms of dirtiness."
"> Blindside late hit that injured a player. Just because they called it a headshot when it wasn't doesn't excuse his history of bad hits.

Blindside hits are only illegal if they're targeted at the head. Whether that hit was late is 50-50 but not being a headshot eliminates the blindside argument from the discussion.

"
"It was literally half a second after he passed the puck, aka every single time a person finishes a check on someone. Don't be dumb. He's had some questionable hits but choosing that hill to die on is laughable. "
The league defines that as an injury. Its the same delineation for minor vs double minor high sticking. Blood is considered an injury
Uh...........Yes.
"If this hit is worth 3 with no prior history, the hit on McAvoy is definitely at least worth a fine"
"That sort of shit he does like that, it's sneaky shit away from the play. It's not blatant so good luck finding video of it. "
"""[No head contact](https://i.gyazo.com/78f94f6566aabf506bd7cb462848b978.png)""

And Backes came in for the hit against the boards. Nielson turned away. We can try and justify both hits all we want. Both were late. Both were blindside. Both were high. Both were shit hits, and both should be punished the same. "
"Ok sure then, I'll remove it and grab another video from youtube to post on there. Plenty to choose from, after all."
"Ah TIL, still comparing the two is crazy."
So they got this one right?
So if they get one wrong they should get every other one wrong?
Have you considered sobbing uncontrollably in the fetal position? 
[Marchand will step up!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwuvn6kCdk)
"His feet were on the ice and he hit him through the body. Their thighs and up are all in contact. There will always be some head contact in hockey unless you eliminate hitting. I bet a large amount of Charas hits have head contact simply because of his size but are still legal. If you want to argue lateness or something else then fine. The contact itself however under the current rules looks legit to me. Elbow in, feet on the ice, through the whole body. "
"One frame means nothing, Backes hit Nielsen in the head, Ritchie hit Backes in the shoulder and because he wasn't paying attention and bracing himself, Backes ragdolled.

Ritchie's hit wasn't late or high and it's only blindside if you think skating with your eyes closed means every hit is blindside."
Yea you basically hit all of them already in his 800+ games except for one other I can think of. 
"> I'm not really buying that the league is taking head contact more seriously

he wasn't saying they got this wrong, just that they're inconsistent"
"They're bitching about DoPS' inconsistency, and they made it very clear that that is what they're bitching about. What of that is confusing you?"
"All of it, apparently."
I don't know if this is satire or not...
">After that I'll probably hack his Twitter account to tweet out how overrated Black Panther was. It's going to be a full day.""

God damn that's evil."

This is hilarious.  I could see Joey doing something trolling back to Kesler.
This has to be satire right? If not I think Johnasen is in Kesler's head.

This couldn't be true. This could also be true. 
I don’t doubt that Kesler would do this....

It was indeed well done. I only poked around to find that because I wanted to be sure. 
Just so dumb that we all have to pretend it was a good movie when every superhero movie sucks
It's not bad but it's not that good either. It is your average Marvel movie but the cgi was noticeably terrible at some points and the fight scenes were bad at times.

Well ya 
Don't know why ur getting downvoted. I liked the movie but it's just ur opinion man.
"I didn't see it but I'll partly agree with you on that one. I'm not crazy about Marvel movies or superhero movies in general. Excluding Deadpool and X-men movies I haven't seen a Marvel movie in theaters since the first Captain America. My friend told me I should go see Black Panther a week ago or so and looked at me like I was a piece of shit when I said I didn't want to see it. I can't comment on anything about the movie itself, but it is ridiculous that its so polarized"
"Personally I don't think they suck, I'm just sick of them. There have been so freaking many Marvel movies now (I'm not talking about DC's attempts at playing ""cinematic universe"" catch-up... those mostly do suck). And I *like* comic books. And action movies! I just can't drum up the kind of excitement I felt for the first Avengers movie anymore when every new movie or tv show I see seems to have a superhero in it.

If I saw Black Panther for the first time 10 years ago, I would have fucking loved it."
When fans of the team the guilty player(s) plays for are even saying it's dirty then you know it's dirty lol

"Personally, I'm not sure what all the hype was about. I like basically every Marvel movie that's been put out, Black Panther included, but everyone was acting like it was a masterpiece and it just...felt like a normal Marvel movie to me."
"I mean there was no excuse for that. Joey just got Gudbrandson straight in the gonads and that was fully intentional for anyone to see.  I thought for *sure* that he was going to at the very least get a game or two, couldn't believe when there was just straight up nothing. Not even a fine."
"I met Mike when I was very little. He signed my jersey along with a lot of other Devils over the years. Around 2000-02, I went to a signing for the A-line. It took about three hours to get to the front of the line and the players all seemed a little worn out. I plopped my jersey in front of them, Arnott signed it, slid it over to Sykora and he started looking at the names on it. Then his face lit up. Mike Peluso! He nudged Elias to take a look. His face lit up. They started asking me questions about when and where I had met him. If it was recently? I told them it was many years ago. They started to reminisce about him. You could tell he was someone very special to them. It screwed up the whole flow of the line and the people running it came over to get it moving again. It was just a name on a jersey but it meant something to them. They had played with lots of players but Mike stood out. He had made a serious impact on these guys. Hearing about his struggles hurts. I hope he finds peace."
"I feel terrible for Mike.  I was a Devils fan growing up and this was a key nhl memory of my childhood:

https://youtu.be/zaalwyFdtBQ

Man sacrificed so much.  I hope he can find peace and comfort."
"“Peluso filed his workers' compensation lawsuit in Santa Ana, Calif., six years ago.”   That’s a long time.


“Peluso told TSN in September that he is determined to proceed to trial after rejecting in late August a $325,000 (U.S.) offer from the defendants to settle his lawsuit.”  That doesn’t sould like a lot, or enough.


“Peluso alleges he is now permanently disabled and he has named four of the five NHL teams he played for – New Jersey, Ottawa, St. Louis and Calgary – and insurance companies, including Chubb Ltd., as defendants in his claim.”   Didn’t even offer $100k each for all that sacrificing the body."
"A psychoanalyst is woefully incompetent to render a professional opinion on someone whose health is endangered by a neurological (as opposed to a psychological) disorder.  What is really needed here is the expert testimony of a neurologist, not a psychoanalyst."
"This kind of hurts to read. I grew up playing hockey and now at the age of 42, having not played for years, am experiencing the same issues. I had a few concussions and many close calls growing up and now seem to show signs of CTE. A few months ago I got up out of bed to use the bathroom and woke up surrounded by medics with a bleeding head from hitting it on the sink during a seizure. I have them in my sleep normally so this one was scary. I increasingly have trouble dealing with confrontation and my fight or flight response is amplified. I refuse to return to work as to avoid hurting somebody or myself. The thought of speaking about it gives me anxiety and panic attacks. None of what the article describes is a surprise to me. I'm waiting to get tested by a neurologist and maybe figure something out. I do not wish this on anyone. "
"Was a big fan of Peluso, but he fought like fucks given = less than zero and got pop'd more than a few times because of it.  The man had no defense in his fights."
"This hits me hard. As a neurologist who grew up playing hockey, I never knew the risks until I was pretty much into University and playing for a college club league where hitting was more prevalent than the high-level travel that I played as a kid. I eventually stopped due to the fear of concussions, as I knew neurology was my future and it exposed me to the great risks that came with the game that I loved. 
My dad played for a bit professionally and took on the role as an enforcer, so their vital role in hockey has been ingrained in me since I was young- I am definitely not advocating for the removal of fighting, but it is tough to see signs of what I fear could become  CTE in my dad. 
That decision to call it quits was the single hardest moment of my life. I pretty much played hockey every day from the time I was 4 until I went to university at 18, and then continued through much of undergrad. 
As echoed in another comment, a ""psychoanalyst"" is definitely not the person who should be treating a person who has a true neurological condition, I hope that Mike can find a neurologist who can further help him in this matter"
"There's a brief Wikipedia article on Mike.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Peluso_(ice_hockey,_born_1965)

[career stats](http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=4224)

"I feel absolutely terrible about this. Especially if Mike is having a high frequency of grand mal seizures. 

My father is diagnosed with epilepsy, and has grand mal (now known as tonic-clonic) seizures.  If anyone hasn't seen what one looks like, [this gentleman recorded what his looks like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nds2U4CzvC4) I'm so used to seizures by now, it's an immediate fight response to help my dad.  The one thing that still shakes my soul to the core is hearing the ""tonic scream""--where, during the tonic phase, the body's muscles tense up and air is pushed out of the lungs where it sometimes results in the individual screaming.  I've only heard my old man scream a couple of time before he goes clonic (aka, the seizing/shaking part).  What is always sad to see is how long after the seizure, it takes my dad to ""recover"" his memory. He used to recover his memory in about 10 mins.  As he's gotten much older, he's now approaching 20-30 mins to recovery his memory.

Just look at that video, and imagine Mike doing that 10 times in a week.  Having his family and people he loves see him go through that, and nothing--and I mean **absolutely* * nothing can be done to help.  Just have to ride the seizure out, and make sure they don't throw up, swallow their tongue, or bite their tongue and choke on the blood.  I'm not saying anything about the place of enforcers or fighting in hockey.  But, just look at the tough place someone's hero is in.  Look where Mike is and what he's dealing with.  If I could give the guy a hug... "
"In light of all the well-documented suffering of former NHL fighters, what is the ethical argument for allowing fighting to continue in the league?"
"I used to love fighting in the game, still enjoy it sometimes but most of the time I see people giving each other brain damage. I feel bad for Peluso. "
"I grew up playing hockey and had practice before and some times after the devils at South mountain. He would regularly come on our ice early or stay late and hang out with us. Show us a few things, and just have fun. He was one of the nicest devils on the team. He was just a genuine good guy, and I'll always remember him"
"At what point does personal responsibility come into play?

Nobody forced him to play. They just let him when he wanted to."
Yet people still give me a hard time for not putting my son in hockey or football.
"Wow, thank you for sharing this. It’s those small moments that make me appreciate the players so much more."
"> I hope he finds peace.

After a tenth grand mal seizure and possibly dying if he travels, I don't think the way he ""finds peace"" will be a desirable one."
"Fights makes the game more exciting, they can jump start a lethargic team and wake up a quiet crowd. They get your blood pumping as a fan, and I'm sure as a teammate even more so.

But what is happening or has happened to people like Mike Peluso, or Stephen Peat, or Steve Montador, or Rick Rypien, or Wade Belak, or Derek Boogaard is terrifying. 

Remember this [fight](https://youtu.be/yJJPivHWy2k?t=14)? I loved PJ Stock and I remember watching that fight as a kid. It's often linked on threads talking about the best NHL fights, which is where I saw it recently. It was only this last time that I watched it that I recognized Stephen Peat's name and connected the man in that video to the one in this [letter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/21/sports/hockey/stephen-peat-concussions.html), and this [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/sports/hockey/stephen-peat-nhl-enforcer-concussions-cte-health.html).

I wonder if Stephen Peat remembers that fight. I wonder if Mike Peluso remembers winning the Cup.

Which current players are we going to be talking about like this in 10 years?"
I would like to point out Bob Dylan was born in Duluth. and raised in Hibbing.
I wonder why he didn't name Chicago? Did they provide treatment or did he not play there long enough or something?
"Yes, Peluso will definitely require the expert testimony of at least one neurologist.

However, there is also a limit to what a neurologist can say about the psychological implications of brain injuries.

If he's suffering grand mal seizures, he shouldn't be travelling; the further comment about loss of identity is the purview of psychoanalysis, not neurology."
">As a psychoanalyst, Dr. Reynolds is not a medical doctor. Peluso’s lawyer Shawn Stuckey said on Dr. Reynolds’ recommendation, he is trying now to get treatment for Peluso from a psychologist or neurologist for his immediate mental health concerns.

That's what the article says as well..."
"Also, to be clear, psychoanalyst is not the same thing as a psychologist. We have no idea what kind of qualifications this person has."
"This *Dr.* Leighton Reynolds seems sketchy to me. I say this because when I tried to look him up online, the details of his education are not well documented. Usually when you claim to have a PhD as part of your credentials, you list all your degrees and where you studied.

I get angry because various governments have allowed people to legally call themselves a ""Dr."" based on some very questionable education or training. But the public sees the word ""Dr."" and understandably believes that a person with that designation is well educated, when in fact they can barely spell."
"Yup. He even ""treats"" Peluso via Skype.

> Dr. Reynolds, who told the court that he treats Peluso between one and four times a week, usually via Skype, wrote that the exams “end up torturing him because they continue to point out to him just how much he is ‘not the man I used to be.’ This needs to stop because they are putting Mike at risk for further seizures, possibility [sic] deadly seizures.”  
>...  
> As a psychoanalyst, Dr. Reynolds is not a medical doctor."
How high of a level did you play?
"> As echoed in another comment, a ""psychoanalyst"" is definitely not the person who should be treating a person who has a true neurological condition

Is it possible that Mike simply can't afford a neurologist, but a psychoanalyst is more affordable?"
Did you quit completely or just contact?
the amazing part of the 400 pims is he did it in 63 games.
"Thank you for this comment and the video link, had no idea what it was and now I know. Sounds like a horrible situation for everyone involved, I hope somehow your father gets better over time, and I wish the same for Mike Peluso. "
"The same we allow punching in boxing or hitting in football.  The fighting Peluso did is no longer part of the NHL game; from pee-wee up into the NHL, its all but gone.  Case in point, the entire Blues defense have fewer lifetime fighting majors than Mike Peluso had in just one season (1991-92), and if you take out Bortuzzo, the Blues D have fewer fighting majors over their career than Peluso had playing just half the season (44 games) for the Blues in 96-97"
"I realize that I’m not picking my spot very well here but if people will hear me out instead of meeting me with vitriol and emotion I’d like to answer this question. 

The reason that fighting and violence should still be allowed is because no one is coerced into a fight, it is entirely consensual and both parties are accepting the risks involved. This is the main reason it should still be allowed. It entertains the fans (which is the goal of the NHL) and the players that fight want to fight. The NHL doesn’t need to be a nanny to tell grown men what not to do that may or may not damage their bodies. 

An additional side note to think about on this subject would be the fact that all these enforcers who had little skill wouldn’t have been in the NHL if it weren’t for fighting. My favorite example of an enforcer (for obvious reasons) is Shawn Thornton. Do you think he’d have the standard of living and improved quality of life had fighting been disallowed in the NHL? 
"
there is a massive difference between the fighting peluso did and the fighting that happens today. 
"I think the helmet rule is a timely step. It bothered me at first because it seemed as silly as it could be, but I've grown to appreciate that knuckles wrecked by plastic are way better than heads wrecked by knuckles.


There are virtually no true enforcers left in the game, guys who can fight but can't play hockey. On my team we've got guys like Lucic and Kassian (and up and comers like Nurse and Khaira) who can strike fear in a lot of guys either from pure strength or the knowledge that they'll go with anyone without fear of their own, we had Hendricks, who maybe didn't strike *fear* per se, but he's a guy who knows how to fight really well, enough to punch up, and when he's out there you know you're not going to get away with dirty shit on his teammates.


But none of those five guys are enforcers, not like the word used to mean. Because if they're not putting up points (eventually... don't jump my point) and playing responsibly in both ends, they're not going to be on the bench. Guys don't sit on the bench for 55 minutes anymore, with their only expectation being to go out for a few shifts to make troublemakers reconsider or to tune them in.


So even the Lucics and Byfugliens and Reaves and Charas are not just boxers on skates. Some of them are just big guys, I don't think a guy like Patty Maroon is a natural fighter, if he was 5'11"" 190, and playing in the NHL, I don't know if he'd ever fight. He's not mean, he's just a big dude and has the heart to stand up for his buddies.


So what's different from the days not-so-long-gone-by of the Proberts and Laraques? For one, there are no more boxers on skates, the guys who still fight are not honing it as their craft night in and night out, so I'm thinking that in the first place, today's fighters aren't as good at it; they're not throwing the same blows (and not receiving them.)


For two, the majority of those blows are now landing on plastic. Lighter, fewer, less-skilled punches, to your helmet, not your head.


But fighting isn't extinct, despite those who ludicrously claim it is, and its role is still being served, refined even; two guys getting their aggression out, whether it's one in defense of a teammate, whether it's both of them trying to stir up their side in a stale game, whether it's just passion boiling over and needing a resolution, two guys getting their aggression out and it's safer now than it's ever been, and the aggression is still out. Maybe their knuckles are bleeding, maybe a guy's nose is broken, but the bare dome (usually) didn't just take a pounding, and it doesn't matter. The aggression gets out regardless of the injury, so the reduced injury is better.


You know that scene at the end of Dazed and Confused? Buddy says something like ""yeah, no one remembers who won or who lost, people just remember, 'oh yeah, they got in a scrap.'"" Of course he's kind of bullshitting to console himself, but a lot of hockey fights are like that in a way. The fight doesn't have to be two pro fighters, it doesn't have to be a brutal conclusion, the act of the engagement into the fight itself accomplishes pretty much everything it needs to: you've stood up for yourself or your team, you've let it be known you're willing to, you've blown off the steam you needed to, and hey, at the end of the day the fans in the stands also got loud, and if it's your home rink they appreciate you standing up for *them* in a way too.


So that's my argument. I perceive fighters to be less specialized than they have been in a while, and rule changes with equipment are lessening damage, yet the fight still accomplishes the goal."
"Considering how much fighting is down this year, it seems like the problem is resolving itself.

Furthermore the critical issue is that if you don't allow fighting, you invite cheap shots, slew foots, vicious slashes, boarding and the like to your star players. Unless players are held accountable by enforcers, they can run around doing whatever they damn well please and all they have to do is sit in the box as a result. Maybe a suspension."
"From my, admittedly limited, understanding it's not just the fighting but the culture where it was expected even if he wasn't well he would go out and do it again, stacking concussions on top of one another essentially without any chance to recover."
"I would suggest watching the Ice Guardian's documentary. I think it provides very good insight to your question and you'll be able to make your own conclusions based on the testimony of the players who lives were to fight for the NHL.

I honestly don't think they make the games more exciting.  I know they fire up the teams playing.. But for me as a fan it just grinds the game to a halt.  Hockey fights are never that entertaining in my opinion. Just guys holding onto each other for balance and taking wild swings till they fall down or the refs get in the way.  Take fighting out of the game and i wouldn't miss it a bit.  But that's just me.

You point out Shawn Thornton's quality of life right now, but what about the guy we're talking about in this very thread? What about the enforcers who have killed themselves? Or Matt Johnson or Stephen Peat? We never make choices with full information-- a player might think it's worth it, only to find it's not. Governing bodies regulate things in part because of how choice operates unevenly. The market's desire for something doesn't authorize an activity simply because someone else might be desperate enough to do it.

"It is an interesting topic of debate about if the league is responsible for protecting players from fighting if they are doing it between two consenting parties.  I don't really have a decisive opinion on that.

Where I do have an opinion is allowing the teams to have designated ""enforcers"" to fight.  If two players who are highly skilled get in each others faces enough all night they decide to drop the gloves that's perfectly acceptable.  Like when Malkin gets in fights.  It's out of rage and the fans all love it.

If a player only puts on a jersey because he knows his job is to go out there and fight another enforcer then that's stupid.  Is that the league's responsibility?  Idk.  But we as fans shouldn't support the league having guys like that who add nothing to the game but knuckles

As for Thorton, his financial situation would be worse if the league didn't allow enforcers, but his body would be much healthier.  What is more important is pretty subjective I guess"
"How prevalent is this sort of thing in boxers? With how often we here of this in the NHL, I’d think all boxers would be afflicted. "
"> The reason that fighting and violence should still be allowed is because no one is coerced into a fight, it is entirely consensual and both parties are accepting the risks involved. 

As others have pointed out, employers bear a degree of responsibility for putting their employees at risk.

But more persuasive, I think, is that players have always been terrible stewards of their own safety. For example, they fought hard against the adoption of helmets.

>Do you think he’d have the standard of living and improved quality of life had fighting been disallowed in the NHL?

If they are accepting the risks then what are these lawsuits for?
"If no one is coerced into a fight and it is entirely consensual then what do you call it when somebody throws a big, legal hit (or even a medium-small legal hit against a star player or a player who immediately wants revenge because he's so embarrassed by how cleanly he was gotten) and gets jumped immediately afterwards despite not wanting to fight because they want play to continue?"

"How many pure enforcers are actually left in the league?

Either way, if they don't want to keep fighting but need to to stay in the league they can always go to a different league with less fighting or where they're considered more skilled. It's not like enforcers sign contracts without understanding the risks they are taking, especially with all the new research about concussions in the past ~15-20 years"
But the NHL isn't like every other business.
"A player DOES have to choose between a paycheck and health. At least some players do. Again I’ll use the Shawn Thornton example. You think he makes the NHL as anything other than a fighter? He was born/trained with that ability but not the ability to score. He had to choose between paycheck and health. If there was no fighting, there’d be no paycheck, and there’d be no Shawn Thornton that you and I’d be discussing. He thought it was worth it. 

There may not be enough information on brain injury for these guys to have a clear picture. This lack of information should signal to these guys perhaps some trepidation or pause before they base their career on this risky action. Again, they still should make the choice for themselves as they are the only ones that can decide risk vs reward. 

Also your edit is unnecessary. I appreciate the healthy debate. "

"No kid starts out in hockey wanting to be nothing but a face-puncher.

At some point, he got approached by a coach who said, ""Unless you start fighting, you're getting cut."" By this point, the game is bound up in the kid's identity, and he may even have some financial stakes or expectations on the line.

That's not coercion in the strictest sense, but it's far closer than what your'e suggesting, which is that becoming an NHL enforcer is just any other job."

Toilets are icky. Permanent neurological damage is more than icky.

I'd say it'd be more like having to clean up dangerous chemical spills with a known substantial risk of harming your long-term health as a part of your job. It's not the only task for your job, but if you were to stop doing it you would be fired. If you pay people enough or if people are desperate enough, some people would definitely still take the job. That doesn't mean we as a society can't say hey, this is exploitation and an unsafe work environment, and the company needs to provide workers with protective equipment or better practices."
"You could say that they are in a sense coerced into cleaning toilets, I guess, but there's nothing wrong with a job cleaning toilets and there's no tradeoff between work and health.

The problem isn't that they are in a sense ""coerced"" into doing their jobs. The problem is that they are in a sense ""coerced"" to sacrifice their health in order to keep their jobs."
"There are very few enforcers because the game has changed so much. Removing fighting from the game would change nothing other than the stupidity after big hits and the small but significant chance of landing on the back of your head after getting hit in the face. 

The same things were said when hockey mandated helmets, and then mandated visors."
"Not trying to be a dick or obtuse, but why shouldn't the NHL have reasonable worker safety standards like every other business?"
"Yeah everything you said is valid, because at the end of the day it is a contact sport.  Guys who play the enforcer role are similar to say, UFC fighters when it comes to looking at long term injuries.  They know 100% what they are there to do, and there's no one to blame but themselves.  Injuries are part of the game and role they play, and it has nothing to do with the league

To agree more with what you said, it's why hitting to the head is so much simpler than fighting.  Hitting to the head is an act that was not in the rulebooks/not called for many years.  The main issue with headshots compared to fighting isthat it is not consenting between 2 players.  Fighting is two players agreeing to punch each other in the head so it is okay.  Taking a run at someone is not okay

Marc Savard has more of a case against the league for his injuries than an enforcer.

The fans objecting to the enforcer type is something that is slowly happening as they get phased out of the league.  As league gets faster and more skilled, fans get upset when they see guys like Rinaldo and Matt Martin in the lineup.  They see those ""enforcers"" as guys taking up a roster spot that could be used for someone who is much better at hockey.  

I see on here people(not you) trying to turn the issue into a black and white ""100% enforcers and fighting"" vs ""100% ban on all fighting"".  So my opinion comes as me trying to fit into both groups as I'm not that passionate about fighting for the most part.

Shawn Thornton (wow I’m hitting this example hard today) is in juniors (or wherever fighting starts) and is approached by his coach who tells him to fight or get cut. If fighting had been outlawed he’d have just been cut.

"But for the enforcer the danger is his only job. He wouldn’t be a hockey player without it.

"OK. So your problem isn’t the supposed coercion itself. It’s more that the coercion has bad side-effects. 

I don’t really know how to debate you on this one as I have already stated that the enforcer in a world with no fighting would be barred from the sport because it is a meritocracy. If don’t have something to offer you don’t play.

"Galen conducted a study of boxers and gladiators, looking specifically at head injuries.

To give a little more historical context:

Galen was 2nd century CE.

Before him, Hippocrates (primarily 4th century BCE) discusses brain trauma in some detail, e.g. re: loss or disturbance of speech and affect.

Rhazes (9th century CE) was the first physician to use a variant of the word 'concussion'.

LaFrancus (13th century CE) discusses concussions in surprisingly modern terms as the shaking or 'commotion' of the brain inside and against the skull.

A little closer to home, Ken Dryden creates a fairly chilling theme in *The Game* (1983) of the ""old goalie"" suffering from the unmistakable symptoms of CTE before CTE was defined.

We've always known; we just didn't want to know."

> One document is a Dec. 18, 1993, medical report confirming Peluso suffered a concussion after hitting his head on the ice during a fight. The second document is Feb. 21, 1994, report from a neurologist warning the Devils that Peluso could have further seizures if he suffered more head trauma.

They knew something bad was going to happen and warned the Devils that he could suffer another seizure. Maybe not CTE, but they had enough concerns that another concussion could lead to a seizure. 

> Four days later, on Feb. 18, Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello told The New York Times that Peluso’s seizure “was primarily due to dehydration and lack of nutrition.” The Times also reported the Devils were concerned Peluso’s seizure could be related to his Dec. 18 concussion.

> In his Feb. 21 report sent to Lamoriello, the team’s trainer and doctor, Ruderman wrote: “[Peluso] likely experienced a major motor seizure on 2/14/94, which I believe is most likely related to a post-traumatic seizure as a consequence of the cerebral concussion in December 1993. I do not believe this was related to dehydration…I do not believe that the participation in playing hockey in itself poses an excessive risk for the development of further seizures unless he were to sustain head injuries.”"

"The Freudian psychoanalytic tradition of Freud, Jung, and others is far less practiced (almost completely extinct really). However newer schools of psychoanalysis (relational psychoanalysis for example) are still practiced regularly and have a fairly strong research backing for their efficacy (just not RCTs due to the difficulty standardizing an inherent idiosyncratic form of therapy).

Psychiatry hasn't moved away from any school of psychology really. Most psychiatrists recognize the importance of both on a higher level treatment basis. While individual psychiatrists may have opinions, the field as a whole doesn't have a stance."
"I agree. However it does play a bit of an apologist role and makes the argument that head hits due to hard equipment are a more serious health problem. 
While I agree the equipment needs to change, the suicides and addictions among the enforcers indicate there is a serious issue.

">...they still have a choice wether to be a goon and accept all the risks involved...

And those risks were not explained, and were in many cases implicitly dismissed.

Not necessarily.

The response might have been, 'Shawn, you're actually a half decent player; go get some skating lessons and take a few stickhandling classes with this guy.'

> ...in juniors (or wherever fighting starts)...

Thorny was taken in the 9th round of the OHL draft; he'd already been fighting in Bantam and Midget in the OMHA.

It was commonplace for older players to unstrap and toss their helmets prior to a fight; even when that was outlawed, you just undid your chinstrap and let the other guy pop the sidesnaps in the initial clinch, or wore your helmet so loose, with a cage so oversized, that it could be pulled off by a stiff breeze."
"But your example isn't applicable - that might be true if players were boxers but no player is on a team solely to fight.  Their employers are not training them to fight, they are not going through the safety measures that boxing has to go through.  In your example, that person is hired to do that specific task, with training and safety measures and expertise for that specific job.  They are not doing a separate job where they might end up doing this risky thing in the middle of it."
"> What is the company’s responsibility **other than providing as much protection as they can?**

The argument here is that the NHL is not providing as much protection as they can because they are allowing a practice that is known to cause long-term neurological damage and debiliation because it makes them more money. 

In your example of an employee transporting hazardous materials, this would be like if employees were getting cancer from frequent chemical exposures. So, the company was debating on whether to force employees to have/obtain a degree or certificate in chemistry that ensures they know how to handle chemicals in the appropriate ways and know what to do in the event of different types of spills. If these new regulations were put in place, productivity might be reduced because they they need to do more safety checks, and the company might have to pay for the additional training. In addition, not every employee is able/smart enough to get this degree/certificate and so many employees might not want to have these new regulations put in place because they or their friends could lose their jobs. 

Does the company still need to put standards in place to protect the employees? Obviously I think they do, and as a society I think we have broadly agreed to this- aka OSHA exists."

I just not a fan of American (or Canadian) football, so it's an easy choice for me. The same goes for boxing and MMA. I don't want to watch them, so I don't have an ethical quandary about them. 

If I was a fan, then I think it's definitely a moral grey area. I don't know enough about the long term health effects of American football to make an informed decision today, though."
Here you have a doctor warning that peluso had a seizure after suffering a concussion warning it would likely happen again if he had more head trauma.  This would be a good case against the Devils
"I would agree that it does take an apologetic role and they left many items open for discussion (suicides and addiction). While they did discuss addiction, they did not really explore what started the addiction, more so that they themselves were at one point addicted but now they are not. I also think it would be good if there was some analysis for addiction among all ""groups"" of NHL players to determine if there is a higher frequency for enforcers to be addicts than other classifications of players (Goalies, Goal Scorers, Defensive Defenseman, Offensive Defenseman, etc) "
"Do you really think that Shawn Thornton didn’t know the risks of being punched repeatedly for many years? 

It’s true that there is a chance that he’d try to improve his other skills with the urging of a coach but I have to imagine that’s the exception to the rule.  I don’t understand why the sports fan always treats the athletes like they are cretins. As you said no kid dreams of being a goon, they dream of being Gretzky. So if (in this example) Thornton had that ability somewhere in his DNA why wasn’t he already attempting to access it? Why would he choose the easier path to the NHL when there are risks involved and the money is vastly less?

"I think there's no question based on my layman's analysis...Spencer, Probert, Boogard, Belak, etc....the analysis that needs to be done is also, how much is a psychological component ie these guys sitting all day every day with the dread of fighting, and how much is based on painkiller addiction caused by injury. And is a fighting injury a reasonably avoidable one? I think so. I also think that the league needs to deal sooner or later with the open secret that most of these guys, enforcers or no, are hooked on painkillers."
"The answer to this question for me is: do players commonly suffer debilitating injury to their longterm mental and physical health, especially ones that result in their premature death? 

I’m not a scientist, nor have I read enough to make a really informed choice. My sense is that the answer is probably ‘yes’ for NFL players and NHL frequent fighters, thanks to the constant blows to the head. 

I think it’s probably ‘no’ for hockey players who do not fight. So, no major moral issue for hockey without fighting.

"At the meeting:

BETTMAN: ""Are you sure? Our revenue is up and I think the fans are getting ti-""

DALY: ""Outdoor. Games."""
The easy solution is to take the call away from the refs on the ice and go to the situation room like they do with other things. If the call is always made by the same 1-2 people then there will be clear consistency and no one will be confused as to what is or isn't interference anymore.
It would be good if they can sort of this issue before playoffs. This has been an absolute disaster this season so far 
"Oh, this will be better than the stupid offside camera addition just before the playoffs in 15-16. I don't doubt the playoffs are going to be a shit show filled to the brim with extra salty salt this year. "
It's so nice how long they let this dumpster fire burn before finally trying to find a solution.

Theres bound to be a huge screw up over this in the playoffs that will cost a team. I can only imagine the outrage if it happens to the Leafs for example.
"You'd think it'd be simple.  Touch the goalie in the crease while he is in the process of making the save, and it hinders his ability to save the puck, it's goalie interference.

"It will likely be more than 1 or 2 but i agree and there is another point of this that i like.

The league can then explain the decisions made after the game and give the reasons why it was / was not interference. 

To be honest that is one of the things we are missing the most, and with the league and ref giving different explanations to Babcock the other night it is confusing."
"It worked for the NFL and ""what is a catch?"" The fans may have not liked the calls, but at least there was consistency in how the rule was enforced."
How do you do that on nights that have 6-8 games though?
The issue with this is that the Refs association specifically negotiated that they make the goalie interference calls. 
"You're assuming the call on the ice is often wrong. It's safe to say the call often goes against the team you're cheering for, but that doesn't necessarily make the call wrong.

But what are they discussing?
There is a definition. And the rules are clear. I don’t understand what needs clarifying. 
"It happened last year in the Oilers ducks series, and that is pretty much what started all of this. 

I would say we can blame everything this season on Kessler and Perry."
This rule would negate most scrums at the net and dramatically reduce scoring.
"In some cases, this rule would allow defensemen to push opposition into the goaltender to negate a goal."
"What happens if the goalie moves into the skater with the intention of interfering with him while having one foot in and one foot out of the paint? These situations are never simple.

Bettman isn't as bad as we meme him out to be. I doubt he's the one behind the stadium series games.
I don't think it's that surprising the explanation given to a coach yelling at the ref to fuck off is different than one given by the league after the game. 
I really don't care what is considered goalie interference. All I care about is that it is consistent ~~so I know when to get upset and rage at the ref~~ so the games feel fair. 
The situation room can make a ruling without seeing it in real time. They just have to review the play. 
The same way they review everything else in the situation room. It's not like goalie interference calls are going to happen simultaneously in all the games that are being played.
"Oh I'm aware of that...but screw them, they've botched the hell out of this thing. Take it off their hands, and if it hurts their feelings then tough luck."
I assume nothing of the kind. I just think I (and everyone else) wants to see consistency with the calls. It's easier to get that when you have only a few people making the calls rather than 30 different people.
outdoor games
I don't either. I've been watching hockey for 20 years. 18 of them this was never a big issue. I have idea why it's gotten so ridiculous the last couple of years. 
"What the definition is to non-officials. Take the Babcock example in the article. 

> Babcock later objected to the explanation he received from game officials, who allowed Larsson’s goal to stand after review. Video replays showed there was contact between the two players while Andersen still had one foot in the blue paint of his crease.

> ...

> “Well, what I don’t like is the report that came out from the league is different than what they told me,” Babcock told reporters in Buffalo Monday. “The (on-ice officials) told me he was interfered with outside the paint, which is not true,. That is goalie interference any way you look at it …

Babcock is getting an explanation (that the location of the contact is what matters, not portions of the goaltender's body), and then rejecting it because it doesn't follow his definition, or a definition that benefits his team. Of course things are going to appear consistent if you don't follow the same definitions the referees do."
"The rules are clear.  There's a definition.  Problem is, the people high up, and the officials on the ice don't seem to understand said rules and definitions at times."
Yeah throw Ritchie in there as well. He seems like the kind of guy who wouldn't tip the pizza delivery dude.
Or the goaltender to initiate contact with a player in the crease and have any potential goal called back.
"Then it's obviously a good goal...? If the goalie is moving into contact it can't possibly be goalie interference, whether it's in or out of the crease."
Can’t forget that fierce Bruins Wild rivalry 
Blackhawks-Team with the most Ex-Blackhawks players
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyP_sdlpJds

Goal or no goal?"
"I would like see a league where the rules are always called as they're written in the rulebook. 

Seeing as we don't have that, we have games with varying levels of leniency. 

So, we have a situation that becomes slightly more complicated. Should the consistency fit in with the flavour of the game being played, or should it the consistency be assessed separately and always to the letter of the rule?
"
"Video review and challenges. The refs haven't dramatically changed in those two years. What has is fans now can make their own opinions of the calls, with visuals to back it up, right away. That heats up a debate."
The contact occurred outside the paint. What you quoted and what you’re saying don’t line up 
"I think the problem isn't that the officials don't seem to understand the rule, I think the problem is that players, coaches, and fans either don't understand the rule or don't care to understand the rule unless it benefits them."
"I know it's very different sports but I like NLL's way of dealing with it (I know the NHL tried it and it ended with Brett hulls controversial goal).

If you are touching the crease, no goal. The players would need to learn to adapt to not touching the crease and find ways to make it work. At least when watching a NLL game I know if it's a good goal or not. None of this ""well his breeze disturbed the goalies jersey, preventing the puck from getting caught in the sleeve."""
"In my opinion, yes good goal. Which is why I, against apparently every Leafs fan and Babcock, think it was a good goal when they played Buffalo.

If the goalie is in his crease, he has to be allowed to move to play the puck so in that case it would be GI. 

It doesn't matter if a toe or foot is in the paint. What matters is where contact is made."
Blackhawks - Coyotes (?)
"It doesn't matter, I just want that call to be the same for all of the ten times it happens in a season. "
Yeah but the rulebook isn't specific on goalie interference. It's a bit of a judgement call. How much contact is interference? How soon before the puck goes in? etc etc
"But over the last month or two they did change it. And now people are mad it’s not consistent? 


Before it was “omg too many goals are being reversed!” And now it’s “omg they didn’t reverse that?” 

The league is crazy. Gms. Coaches. Players. It’s only okay when it benefits them and that’s fine. But don’t turn around and complain. "
"Quite. The contact occurred outside the paint, and the Babcock is saying that it didn't. It's not the refs being inconsistent here."
So a loose puck in the crease is dead? 
Blackhawks-Canes
"If the league moves the call to the situation room, I would suggest adding another rule. If the coach yells at the official after the ruling it's an automatic ejection. Also, every explanation is given to the team after the game. I'm undecided if the ruling should be public. Might help, might not.

I suspect if they do move it there, not much will change. Fans and analysts will still complain about calls that go against their team. "
They didn't change the rule. All Bettman said was make the reviews quicker. Quicker reviews imply that the on ice call is going to remain more often.
So Babcock is just wrong. What are you evening arguing? The contact occurred outside the paint. You can literally see that on video review from multiple angles. Following the rule if contact occurs outside the crease skaters have equal stake in that ice. 
"'Yotes have 3 former Blackhawks: Raanta, Hjalmarsson, Panik

'Canes have 5: TVR, Teuvo, Nordstrom, Darling, Dahlbeck

I forgot about Nordstrom & Dahlbeck."
I can't believe you're actually defending the current state of goalie interference calls
Right. Because the intent isn’t to nitpick. What is so difficult here 
"That's exactly what I'm arguing - that Babcock is wrong.

You don't understand ""what needs clarifying."" What needs clarifying is that Babcock (and others) are wrong, not the refs.

> What the definition is to non-officials.

> Of course things are going to appear consistent if you don't follow the same definitions the referees do.

The refs are pretty consistent. There is a definition, and the rules are clear. The inconsistency comes from what people think the definition is, or what they want it to be, not what it is. 

You seem to see my responses as antagonistic to your position. They're agreeing with you."
I said that out of a joke without even looking it up. Just hire me already NBC
"It's typical when the issue becomes a big deal because it's the Leafs, when teams/coaches have been complaining  for most of the season.


Here's the thing. People in this thread want to see the review moved to the situation room. There are NHL referees that have officiated well over a thousand games. I'd like to know how many calls the folks in the situation room have made.

Yes, I think the rule needs to be explained. I also think every close GI call should be reviewed. Moving the review to the situation room  won't be the solution most fans think it will be."
"I don't think this is just a Leaf's related issue here. This has been going on all season long to every team. See Edmonton, and their 16 straight call-against streak."
wow i cant believe Datsyuk never recorded a 100 point season. Looks like the closest he had was 97 in 07-08 and 08-09
Ovechkin in his prime was the most fun hockey player to watch. He literally just fucking smashed everyone and scored a shit ton. 
"I think you meant ""would"" not ""will"".  Since he didnt do it yet "
Malkin's probably going to do it with him. 
"Canadians who have done it in the last 22 years (since 1996):

"Good luck to Kuch! He deserved it in large part because of hard work, not only due to his talent"
"If you sort by year, you can see that Russians usually do it in pairs."
That's some awesome drafting by tampa
Because of this post he'll top out at 99 points.
"""He will be"" as if it's a sure thing"
"I see that my favorite player of all time, Alex Mogilny, [had 127 points in 1992–93](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mogilny#Career_statistics), including a very impressive 76 goals. And he had 107 the first year with the Canucks, 1995-96. I remember his chemistry with Cliff Ronning was phenomenal that year."
I dont think he will do it
The last being Mogilny when he was a Canuck. I was thinking Bure but I always forget about Mogilny.
"Datsyuk, Kovalev, and Kovalchuk are three more russians who only had 95 or more points but not 100. fun facts. "
"I dont know how to use that site, who has the most ""on pace"" points this year out of Kuch and Marchand?

EDIT: 

Kucherov 82 game pace: 108.49

Marchand 82 game pace: 106.12

Incredible, to think I didnt even know who kucherov was a few years ago."
Great job jinxing him to get hurt
Being on the juice will do that for ya.
"Datsyuk was responsible everywhere on the ice, he was truly an amazing two way player. I would argue that hurt his numbers slightly overall compared to what they could have been had he focused more on offensive output (not that his was bad). He was an amazing player everywhere on the ice, I love his defensive highlights almost as much as his offensive ones. "
"I believe Fedorov and Yzerman are the only players to win a Selke and score 100+ points in separate seasons in their entire career, and Fedorov is the only one to ever do both in the same season (which he did twice).

The fact that Datsyuk was 6 total points away from matching Fedorov in doing it twice shows how insanely good he was on both sides of the puck"
Dude remember those highlights when people would line him up and as soon theyd go for the hit hed fucking send them flying backwards
I think Hitting sniper in EASHL was created because of him lol
is ovechkin not still in his prime? hes put up so much impressive stats throughout his whole career its hard to pinpoint exactly where his prime begins and ends.
Are you trying to tell me that these eggs aren't chickens?
"I don't think OP meant that all. OP seems to be already decided that it will happen. The wording you personally should have used is ""should"". 

Side note: I was able to out pedant a pedant before coffee. This should be a good day. "
"I'd still call Heatley Canadian, cause calling him German is like calling William Nylander Canadian."
Backstrom didn't make the allstar team that year lol
"Ovechkin 4x
Malkin 3x"
McJesus!
"why exactly is heatley under germany just cuz hes born there.....hes canadian raised, trained, and competed lol put him under canada."
Yep he put a net in his garage over the summer just to practice his shot. He wants to win and get better
I downvoted you because you were at 99 points and I didn't want you to get 100. :)
They were an incredible pair: speed to burn.
Hard to say. He is one of those guys who could get 7 points in two games 
I don't think he will because OP jinxed it
"That is the easier bet to make for sure... But if he keeps up his average point production and plays the rest of their games, he's on pace for 105 points.. so he's got a 5 point buffer to decline in point production. I hope he does"
Totally wrong. Marchand is “on pace” for 89 points this year.
"Judging by your comment history, we shouldn't be surprised to see this. "
I love the highlights of his making people fall over from deking or causing them to run into their own teammates.
hey he didnt hog the selke trophy for almost half a decade for nothing.
"Ron Francis did it as well.  Won the Selke in 1995 and had a couple of 100 point seasons.

Edit: Doug Gilmour scored 127 points in his Selke season of 1992-93.

Further edit: Bobby Clarke won the 1983 Selke and had a couple of 100 point seasons earlier in his career."
"Fuck, I miss that guy in the NHL. There's not enough SKA St Pete's highlights on this sub. I know he must have at least 1 or 2 highlight reel moments every game over there"
"https://www.hockey-reference.com/awards/selke.html
Four of the top six and six of the top 12 in points for Selke winners were Red Wings between 1994 and 2010. Also, all of the top 4 by point shares. Draper won one too in 2004. We've had some good two-way/defensive forwards. "
"Considering Fedorov played with a better team too. Datsyuk just started his career with the 2002 wings, during the waning years of the super group. "
Always blew my mind how he could turn it around like that haha 
"Idk he might be a *little* bit slower, a *teensy* bit less aggressive maybe. Still a manimal, tho..."
No.  And the cart goes *behind* the horse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSVgKlk4f-w
"In that case, I'm fine with it."
He's on there.
"Tbh, I hear that story a lot and I don't think that is the best testament to his work ethic. I'm sure plenty of players practice their shot and several young players practice on their shot outside of a rink nowadays. I think the best example of his work ethic is grinding out his first season on the bottom lines and being benched several times. He was a pure offensive forward who made a lot of cute plays but now learned to round out his game. Never heard any bad news about Kuch complaining about not playing or playing more responsibly. Him calling out player's work ethics on the team, shows how much he values work ethic."
Ditto
Up voted to bring it back to 99!
I think what /u/saysnotbad is doing is taking Marchand's point pace in the games he's played and extrapolated them over an 82 game season
Do you know what an 82 game pace means?
I don’t recall making many harsh comments about players. 
Making professionals look like amateurs was a speciality of his. The Couture deke gets me every time
https://i.imgur.com/6LvfP99.gif
I miss him

[eh?](https://zeroturnaround.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/carthorse.jpg)
Good ol' Canadian boy. 
Only after that post reminded me that I'd missed it.
"I know, that’s exactly what they are doing— but it’s not a valid calculation in relation to the question

>who has the most “on pace” points this year

It’s misleading to place Marchand at 106 points at all, because he only has 18 games remaining. There is no possible way for him to achieve that at his current pace.
"
"I know that it’s totally not what you think it is— Marchand’s PPG is inflated by playing less games. The only accurate statistic that holds any value is (82-GP)xPPG+Current points. Marchand was never “on pace” for 106 points, and he never will be. Just taking a players PPG and multiplying it by 82 is farcical."
maybe cause you're on the juice?
Or the absolute ruinations of Turco and Vokoun.
"I thought it was his hands that made him leave? Either way, he still played the full KHL season as far as I'm aware (except a few games he might have been suspended?)"
"I used to love Mitch Hedberg. I still do, but I used to, too."
"Great Mitch Hedberg reference to kick off the day, thank you!"
"Ah, gotcha."
"look at what I wrote, I said 82 game pace when I added the stats"
"It's just a way to put all players on a level playing field. Marchand falls (not very far) down the stat lines because of missed games. So an ""82 game pace"" plugs those stats in and shows you where everyone really is.

He's played roughly 80% of Boston's games and they're roughly 80% through the season. So these aren't some outlier ""played 2 games got 3 lucky points"" numbers. Or even early season numbers where Marchand WAS on pace for 123 points after 6 games (or 128 after 7...) "
"Yeah, it was his ankles. Ruptured tendons led to surgery and the ligaments in his ankles now are from cadavers. "
"No, it’s a way of putting players on a skewed playing field to make them equivalent. Tell me: is there any chance, at his current point production, for Marchand to have that many points? If the answer is no, it’s a shit comparison. "
"Ah yeah that's right, I remember hearing about the cadaver tendons. Either way, he's still at just about a point per game over there."
"I think you're confused by what ""82 game pace means"". It doesn't mean ""How many points will a player have at the the end of the season."" It does mean ""How many points would a player have (approximately) if they played 82 games.""

At the end of the year Kucherov will have more points than Marchand (Unless Kuch misses the rest of the season). But you can't discredit the fact that both players are producing almost the same PPG at 1.3 (MacKinnon is over 1.4! Despite being more productive he will also finish with less points than Kuch). "
"I’m not confused about what it means— I’m saying it is not a valid comparison, especially when Marchand has played only 51 games."
"Compare Marchand to Barkov instead. They both have 66 points. It took Barkov 63 games and it took Marchand 51. They are still tied in points but who is playing better?

It is fair to assume that if Marchand weren't injured and suspended this year that he would have more points. Even at HALF his Production rate on the season he would have another 8 points if he dressed those 12 games. That bumps him up to 74 points (Tied for 9th instead of 18th). If you give him full credit at 1.3ppg (with a sample size of 51 games I think most analysts would be okay with that) another 7 points are added to make 81 (3rd overall in points).

I think I know what you're trying to say, that you can't give him credit for 81 points when he has 66. You're right, you cannot. If they continue to produce the same and play every game Kuch will indeed finish the season 20 points ahead of Marchand. But this ""fake"" stat is still a useful tool to compare players. Marchand is more likely to get points than Barkov, even though they have the same amount of points. Or if Marchand had 10 less points he'd be buried in the standings like his linemate Bergeron (54pts in 55 games) and people are less likely to notice what an insane year he's having.

Why do analysts look closer at Goals against average and not purely goals against? Because the average is a better representation of how they are playing. Points per game is also a better representation than total points. "
Wingels mom looking for karma.  It's harmless.
Him?
"For any player,

Normal fandom: current NHL team jersey

Genuine, above-average fandom: current and former NHL team jerseys

Super fandom: juniors/college, AHL/minors, and NHL team jerseys that player played for, with an allowance for one dream-team jersey

Creepy, might-need-a-restraining-order fandom: this person's collection (caveat that if it's a family member it's okay)."
I didn't realize Wingels was on that many teams.
"And almost all of them are cheap Chinese knockoffs.

Which is probably a good thing now that I think of the cost of actually getting 29 full priced ones...."
I can get behind this collection. I love Wingels.
So I was at the tank the day or two after the trade and I see a guy with a Boston Wingles jersey on. No idea how he got one so fast. 
Can we list the teams? And where is the Miami RedHawks one? 
but he's only been on 4 NHL teams.. wtf?
I'm not trying to be rude but Wingels is an odd player to lose your sanity over.
I imagine this is close to what the Staals' parents house looks like.
This is weird. 
"I think you've been found out, u/foundinwonderland"
This is a very impressive collection here. Props!
"If you like Wingles so much, get a “Wingels don’t pass” jersey."
Could this be the mastermind behind the @LilTommyWingels account?
Will he buy a second jersey when we sign him in the summer?
"What is the point of this...?  And of all people, Wingels?  Nothing against the guy, but this is strange.  Like people buying Malkin Penguins jerseys as a meme after his multiple cup wins with Chicago.  

Edit: not saying anything about Wingels skill or whether people can or can’t like non-star players, I was remarking on the weirdness of having a bunch of jerseys from teams he never played for.  As the OP pointed out to me, there was an athletic article explaining it that I missed.  Also, I shoehorned in a malkin/Chicago circlejerk joke for which I will accept my just punishment.  "
"What, is he funny or something? "
"He wasn't. SJS, OTT, CHI, BOS."
"Thought the same thing, and as I was writing a similar post I realized it must include pre-NHL teams he played on."
"creeped his twitter, the guy has A LOT of disposable income it would appear. buys everything straight from the NHL shop"
Go mooseheads! 
"> And almost all of them are cheap Chinese knockoffs.

I didnt even know you could get Chinese knockoffs customized. I thought they just offered pre-made NHL players. "
https://twitter.com/michaelmoskie/status/971510395239153664
He was sitting right in front of us in Section 115. He was entertaining :)
Same guy
"I saw him too, wearing the Boston jersey the day after the trade. I know you can’t get a good jersey customization within a day so it blew my mind. This all makes sense but I’m not sure it’s really any less weird."
">And where is the Miami RedHawks one?

That's what I was looking for!"
If only I was that rich
"Kurz said in an Athletic article the guy refused to get a Sens jersey, so he got a bunch of different ones instead as a fuck-you to them.  Then his friends got in on it."
"People don't have to only love elite players man, it's their choice"
The guy's last name is probably Wingels as well.
"Ok but those jerseys are counterfeit.

EDIT: to clarify I'm not judging him for not spending $5800 on authentic Tommy Wingels jerseys for a joke"

Funny you should ask. This guy is one of my best friends. My cousin lives in Oxford and is always at the rink for the youth program. She calls me up two weeks ago and said that Miami was having a 50% off sale on their jerseys at the team shop ($80/jersey). I texted my friend and said they had three designs. 2 minutes later I had $240 in my Venmo. He just received them in CA yesterday.
Ah see now that makes sense and is pretty funny.  
Lol legendary

"Rinne's .928 and Gibby's .927, both goalies are hot right now... thursday should be (even more) interesting"
"Rinne is definitely one of the most interesting goalies playing.  While some goalies are definitely hot or cold, he either rides a .934 save percentage with 2 GAA or goes .885 with a 3.5 GAA.

The Predators could easily win the cup if he stays hot."
"Imagine if we had proper Finnish Olympic team with: Rinne, Rask, Laine, Barkov, Rantanen, Aho, Ristolainen etc."
Nobody say it
"Rinne-O-Saurus Rex is a terrible nickname, no?"
I really hope he wins the Veniza. I feel like he will be punished due to rest days. His save percentage and GAA are best in the league and he plays on the second best team in the league. Unfortunately it feels like wins are the most important stat for this award and with him resting more often to prepare for the playoffs it will cost him the award
Guys how come our goalie can't be uninjured like the rest of them
It's definitely going to come down to Rinne and Vasy for the Vezina.
This kills the Central.
He is just too good right now
Didn't y'all hear? That guy is washed up.
Pekka Rinne is too good right now
You know what that means. 7-6 game coming right up. 
"Last year he was inconsistent and trending down big time until the postseason.

This year, he's had maybe three noticeably bad games out of 49. 

If it's really because he adjusted his positioning in the offseason, massive props to him. "
That's not really fair. The only truly garbage season he had was because he had an undiagnosed infection in his hip from a surgery complication. His worst season besides that was  a .908SV with a .248GAA
Are there goalies that don't do this? It's a volatile position
"Rinne’s thing is being average all year, and then being a brick wall the entire post season. He’s probably one of the best playoff goalies of all time. Dude knows when to flip the switch. "
Imagine if everyone had a proper Olympic teams.
it
https://youtu.be/hLfgRZxGKeY?t=10m17s
Honestly it’s awful.
"I've never heard that before last night, and now twice. It's a goddamn atrocity. Just call him Peks or if you HAVE to get cute about it, Rinne Wall since [that dude](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/closeup-of-nashville-predators-fan-wearing-phony-brick-wall-news-photo/693043280?esource=SEO_GIS_CDN_Redirect#/hockey-nhl-finals-closeup-of-nashville-predators-fan-wearing-phony-picture-id693043280)'s been doing that forever."
If you delete the O in the middle it flows better. Person who wrote this was high. Even then it doesn't make sense for a goalie to be compared to something historically mocked for inept tiny arms
unfortunately the Vezina is pretty much the Most Wins Award like the Cy Young Award is in baseball
"Hey now, if we stay hot there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to win the President's Trophy. We're only one point behind TB right now, and they've played one more game than us. It should be a tight race. "
We even have a city wide title drought of 1 season havent we suffered enough?
Gibson deserves some credit too
Can someone explain thid reference to me?
Too good right now
I’ve been hearing that for a couple years now as well.
"As long as we score the 7 goals, I'm ok with it"
"I’m thinking the Carolina home game, and the 2nd home game against Winnipeg. "
"Yeah but would be the first time that Finland fields a roster full of NHL talent. Especially during a year like this when Finnish players left and right are popping off.
"
You monster.
This is why we can't have nice things 
GET THAT EVIL AWAY FROM ME
I think it should just be Rinne-or-Saros Rex(rule).
"That hasn’t been the case in baseball in years. For the most part if they go with the guy with an extra win or two, it’s usually because they threw 20+ more innings with more K’s than the next guy and not because of the extra wins "
You got downvoted but the /s was implied heavily and i laughed super hard 😂😂
"There is a YouTuber named UrinatingTree that makes comedy sports Videos. He did a prediction video for the SCF last year and he said ""I can't see Nashville losing Peakka Rinne is just too good right now"". Nashville then lost and if memory serves shoty goaltending was a big reason why."
https://youtu.be/hLfgRZxGKeY?t=9m59s
Hopefully Kesler has three of those goals too. 
That carolina game was brutal
"He was bad in San Jose back in November (4 goals on 23 shots) and everyone played badly against Boston and Pittsburgh to open the season

(Fuck that Carolina game)"
First game that pops up in my mind. I want to forget it.
Ayyy. That Carolina game was the one game i choice to go to this year. Brought my sister to her first hockey game... Rip her hockey interest when we went down 4-0 in like 4 seconds 
Remember World cup? And Filppula's goal..
https://youtu.be/Vgf0XA8f4QY
"fair enough, I don't follow baseball but I've heard that that was pretty much how it's been being determined. Thanks for letting me know!"
"Shit I didnt even see the downvotes just checking now. We even have a long list of things that have happened since the Cubs last title

Edit: The world when the Cubs last won the world series (there more people can probably add as well)

- Obama was President

- Catalonia had not yet declared and withdrawn Independence from Spain

- Kendrick Lamar had only released 3 Albums

- Hugh Hefner, Chuck Berry, Chester Bennington, Princess Leia, and Adam West were all still alive

- Harvey Weinstein was not known as a rapist

- Vegas had no professional sports teams

- Taylor Hall was still an Oiler

- Jagr and Hossa were active players in the league

- Datsyuk was fresh off his NHL retirement

- Subban was still a Hab while Weber was the Preds captain

- The Hawks have never been swept in a playoff series during the big 3 era :'("
Ugh that guy 
I clenched at every shot on goal for the next couple games
I think I just picked that Winnipeg game because they scored the GWG on him right in front of me at Bridgestone and it was just an uncharacteristically poor play from Pekka. 
The biggest obstacle for teams to beat the Ducks is Gibby. 
"Also 5 PP goals for during that stretch (meh), so 7 special team goals to 1 (not so meh)."
"That's what you call a power-kill, ese. "
"Shhh. Stop telling people about Gibson. It's nice having people not realizing how good players not named  Kesler, Getzlaf, and Perry are."
Inb4 We should have kept Freddie (miss him tho!)
"Definitely. He's only given up more than 2 goals once in the past 10 games, and that one time was a blowout win anyway.  You have to shut down our offense to beat us."
5 PP goals on how many chances? If it's only 15 chances that's good. If it's 25 or more than not so good.
That kid backing up Gibby ain't bad either. He could definitely find a starting job in a couple years once he matures.
"Nah, I need people to come in knowing, because we really need y’all to start losing sometime here. "
To be fair the biggest thing stopping teams from beating the leafs is Freddie.
"Even as a Kings fan, I have nothing but immense respect for how good Gibby is. It’s honestly ridiculous. "
"It was 26. Yeah, PP isn't great (hence the ""meh""), but I've got to believe a +0.5 special teams goal differential per game is fairly good, especially since the best teams in the league are in the +0.7 to +0.9 total goal differential. "
No thank you. It's nice being in 2nd place in the division and not having to worry about being in a wild card spot.
Oh FredEX is legit I'm aware. I'm just tired of the Gibson sucks circlejerk every time we are doing bad.
"Last time I saw the statistic, when adjusted to the first 10 years of all goalies' careers, Gibson's save% was 3rd all time only behind Hasek and someone else. That man is good at that whole goalie thing."
"For sure, I figured it was in that ""meh"" range, just wanted to confirm "
The Pacific will be right down to the wire this year
"Boy, I remember what that feels like. "
"Holy hell, this is the worst."
If only he wasn't made of glass so far. It'd be fun to see what he can do in a full healthy season. 
"His 5on5 save percentage among starting goalies is first in the league I believe. Kid is just insane, and still a few years away from peaking. "
">When Ovechkin was a 20-year-old rookie, the Penguins’ equipment manager sought him out after a Capitals practice in Piney Orchard, Md. He had a gift for Ovechkin: a signed Mario Lemieux stick. It was the first one he had ever received from another player, so Ovechkin then started asking other stars for their sticks, typically offering one of his in an exchange. He has roughly 100 sticks from other players now, including Pittsburgh centers Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and Edmonton’s Connor McDavid. Lemieux’s is still his favorite.

This is one of the coolest things I've ever heard"
biggest collection of backstrom signed sticks ever
"Now I want a painting of Ovi on a horse playing the mandolin, hanging right over the fire place "
"Is there a player who loves the game more than Ovi?

Stuff like this show his appreciation for history and his teammates' contributions to his accomplishments, and then how he gets as excited for his 598th goal as he does for every other goal, and not only that - he gets just as excited for his *teammates'* goals. The dude just fucking *loves* hockey.

Some may love it just as much, but I don't think any could be said to love it more."
"""Just four players in NHL history have scored at least 50 goals at 32 or older; Jaromir Jagr was the last to do so during the 2005-06 season."" 

... 32 and older ... 05-06 season ... "
Watch this motherfucker try to steal the Cup for his museum when he finally wins it
"Ovi is the man. dude is arguably (in my opinion he is) the best goal scorer the game has ever seen.

to top it off he's got a wicked personality off the ice and is super humble for being a massive star. we need more Ovi's"
"Things like this are what make Ovi my favorite non-Ranger. He's a hell of a competitor and hockey fan. Never takes it for granted. Thankfully, it doesn't seem like he is taken for granted either"
That..... Is freaking cool. And shows that he acknowledges and appreciates the teammates who have helped him through his career. Awesome piece of TIL trivia
"So what I learned today is that, no matter how much success you have in life, you're still a kid who left a bunch of his shit at his parents' house."
That is freaking awesome
"That’s fuckin awesome, love hearing the respect he has for the game and looks out for those who helped him in his NHL career and scoring those milestone.

I hope Ovi can win a Cup at least once."
TIL: Kids hockey trophies in Russia look identical to those in Canada.
Jamie Benn would love to snap those sticks over his knee. 
Not gonna lie that last line choked me up a little. 
I would love to just walk through this and examine everything
The world doesn't deserve Alexander Ovechkin
I love how much Ovi loves the game. What a beaut.
He's definitely building a Game of Thrones Iron throne. 
Not one stick pic
"> There’s a painting in the living room depicting Ovechkin riding a horse while playing the mandolin

I need this"
"What a beaut! Bring the cup home, Sasha! "
"In Russia, is he considered a better player than Federov?"
"He's also known for being a pretty prolific stick trader.  A lot of guys in the league like to trade sticks with particular opponents after they play against them, and apparently he loves doing this.  I saw a picture of the room he displays them in once, and you literally can't see any wall through all the sticks that he traded for."
I work for For the Honda Center. If he scored his 600th goal tonight against the Ducks he wanted to take the goal net with him. 
now that's classy
Ovie eats hockey shaped cereal for breakfast
"Saying this a Pens fan, this makes me like Ovechkin even more. It’s amazing how humble of a guy he is. Lemieux and Sid are my favorite players making these connections between these three even more special for me. I was kinda young when these two teams played in the ‘08 and ‘09 seasons and didn’t know much about the Caps except that I didn’t like them because they were beating my team haha. Crazy to think that was the beginning of their latest rivalry, it feels like Sid and Ovi have been playing forever. I love this game. "
"This is a great read. OV is a DC hero, I'm glad he loves what he does. It's a beautiful thing to watch him play. "
"As a fellow game worn/used memorabilia collector I'll say that I was very skeptical of this article at first.  MANY players collect stuff just to later cash in on it due to the lack of items out there.  I won't name specific teams but there are a lot of them doing this today. 
 
I've always been aware that Ovechkin kept memorabilia from his milestones but I'd always assumed it was from a capitalistic (mind the pun) point of view.

Honestly it seems that's really not the case as he seems to be collecting certain items for sentimental value as well such as the Penguins stick and Turco's helmet.  It makes me so happy as a collector and as a fan that he's so committed to celebrating his own personal milestone's this way as a collector, but also as an athlete.  It gives me hope that he may one day hit 900 goals.

More athletes should take such pride and celebration in their accomplishments.  It might elevate and motivate them to reach greater achievements like we've seen from Ovi.  

From a Leafs fan."
That's adorable.
"Can we please get a pic??

"
"I love hearing things like this. He knows he's an amazing player, but he doesn't boast or brag about it. He even shares the credit for all his goals with his teammates and commemorates them by keeping their signed sticks. That is such a humbling thing to hear. Much more respect to Ovie for this. "
"This is incredible, this makes me love Ove more than I already do. "
Aha what a coincidence just last night during the Calgary-Pittsburgh game they were saying Crosby likes to collect opponents sticks and asked for a stick from Johnny Hockey
"Do I see a Penguin on the couch in this room?


Ovechkin to Pittsburgh. Its gonna happen. "
Is anyone gonna talk about the duck in the room??
Can we please get a pic??.
His parents are so happy and proud. I hope he wins a cup for them. 
"The must be extra blessed sticks or some call lucky.

It is good he puts them away.  It would be unfair if he used them in another game."
Hopefully whoever inherits this incredible collection appreciates it as much as he does.
I love Ovechkin almost as much as Ovechkin loves Ovechkin 
I love OV
Solid emergency retirement fun if he ever becomes wreckless with his spending 
i mean sometimes the guy celebrates harder than his teammate who did score the goal. hes obviously loves the game and his teammates 
Greatest Of All Time
"If there's any player I want to see win the cup, it's Ovi.

I understand that they are all kids who grew up to realize their dream, but I think for most, that kid dies once they see their first paycheck. I feel like Ovi still has that kid somewhere in there."
luckily we don't have to worry about him winning the cup and trying to keep that. 
This is so wonderfully wholesome
"I think everybody wants to see ovi win a cup. Pens fan, just dont have that pen marker attached to my name. Very lazy, 420 and all of that ... what were we talking about...?"
I very rarely watch hockey... but goddamn they got some of the best quality people in professional sports that all seem to have the deepest personal connections to their chosen sport!
If anyone deserves a Cup...
"That cup assist stick though. Signed by no
One ever."
Lamo anyone else peep on that sharks jersey hanging on the far right wall?
Somewhere Steven stamkos is laughing (only few people will get this joke) 
Except we can't win a Cup with him to save our lives.
Still not rooting for him to get past Pittsburgh in the 2nd round of the playoffs.  
"He's really just researching opposition stick curves and flex, to help him optimize his goal scoring. The whole ""significant goals"" thing is just a cover. "
"Him saying Lemieux's is still his favorite is awesome (obvious bias acknowledged). God bless this man, he deserves a cup. "
Man I can't imagine Alex Ovechkin coming up to me after a game and asking to trade sticks. What an honour
"It's awesome to see it mentioned here, that rink in Piney Orchard is where I grew up playing! The Capitals used to practice there before they moved to Kettler. It's in a small community in Odenton, MD, I really have no idea why the Caps practiced there, but it was so special to have that be my hometown rink. Lots of memories in that little place.

Any other redditors here who have played there? "
"I’ve never been a fan of Ovi, but that just changed my mind. Mad props. "
"Right? There's just something about a player that's never lost that childhood spark that always brings out the kid in me, too. "
"That’s fucking awesome hearing this. Always collecting other player sticks who are worthy adversary, but always cherish Lemieux the most.

"
I agree. This made me warm and fuzzy. 
"The dynamic of giving/receiving sticks from players is really cool. Elite players will give their sticks to rookies as a show of respect. Veterans might ask for a stick from a rookie for the same reason. If you're a rookie, you don't just ask for Crosby's stick. "
A well known tradition in soccer is the coolest thing you've ever heard?
A lot of players in the NFL do this with their game jerseys. 
It probably smells like success. 
"So Ovie's just a really, really talented hockey fan?"
"He cornered the market, dudes gonna be rich"
Damn.... Didn't think of that. 
Backstrom Ovi museum. 
This is why they don't play on a line anymore. Need to save Backstrom's wrist for the playoffs.
Gotta be shirtless too 
Are there any picture of this? I can’t believe he has this. 
Who has that picture in their own house?? That's insane.  I need to see it too.
It will be a fucking tragedy if this man never wins the cup. 
"I remember when he broke into the league, he got a lot of hate for being so excentric/showing passion. Hockey is probably the Big-4 sport the most lacking in personalities/marketable stars. Ovies done more than any other player to change that imo. "
"I honestly don’t think so. Nobody made me fall in love with the sport more than Ovi, who looks like he takes absolutely nothing for granted out there. I love it "
"With the risk of being biased, Crosby is one I can think of that is borderline obsessed with his love of the game."
Jagr
Well said. It's refreshing to see his child like love and passion for the game. 
He’s like he Ichiro of hockey
I was never really a Ovechkin fan until I attended the All Star Game in Columbus a few years ago.  Watching him play and just genuinely having fun out there made me appreciate him more as a player.
Scheifele? There was that sportsnet promo on how he goes home after practice and just waits until the nhl games come on tv
"Jagr is a freak. A wonderful, beautiful-to-behold freak of nature. To be NHL caliber at his age... I'm grateful to have lived through such an incredible career. "
... Or just never turn it back in after his day with the cup
"I remember them saying his goal against Toronto was 598, and I had a 'Holy Shit' moment because *598 goals in 12 seasons* (roughly). I haven't been under a rock, I knew his numbers...but, it just hit me. 

And everything I ever hear about the man off the ice is just as amazing. Washington's lucky to have him.

*edit: *598*, typo."
"I remember that time when he was ""man on a street"" [interviewed during a blizzard](https://screengrabber.deadspin.com/ovechkin-spotted-getting-gas-to-plow-neighbors-driveway-1754639218). "
"Ovi is unquestionably a fantastic person and hockey player.

But fuck that guy. Cuz he’s such an unquestionably good guy and hockey player and he doesn’t play for my team."
"the amount of goals in the amount of time he has scored them isi unfathomable. 

I would say he is easily the best goal scorer of all time.  I remember Selanne getting 600 and being blown away, thinking about how many players came before him, and how he has done the near impossible.  Ovechkin is going to do it in far less time, during a scoring era where a rookie could never build up the scoring states selanne did in his rookie year. "
"I remember claiming a few years ago that he was the best natural goal scorer that the league has maybe ever seen and getting push back from my friends, but I do agree with you. The fact that he has been playing the same spot on the power play for so long that it's a narrative people have to talk about is impressive alone. ""There's OVI standing in the same spot as always. You know he's there, you know they're giving him the puck, you know roughly where, when, and how he will shoot, you still won't stop him."""

Just like to point out he also actively engages in propoganda for a dictator who wants to destroy our life. Not such a wicked personality in my books.
"Yeah. Caps fan for almost 30 years. I watched the entire 4OT  against The Pens in 1996. 

I will always support The Caps and not backing down. 

But just once I want The Caps to win Stanley. It would make all the years of pain worth it.

Honestly, how are Caps fans perceived by fans of other teams?"
he needs a cup or olympic gold.  Would be one of the biggest crimes in sports if either didn't happen. 
It's crazy how little emotion benn and Seguin have when they score. 
Woah wadup Norwich 
Only reason I opened the article.  And nothing.
Makes sense.  Dude just loves playing hockey.
I’d shoot myself in the face.
You shut your fucking mouth!

He is definitely one of my all time favorites. I will be sorely disappointed if he never wins one.
I'm there too now.  I hate they would probably have to go through us though.  Real mixed emotions.  Perhaps we could trade Sheary for Ovi and then I am fine with it all.  
"Yup! Baltimore Stars, St. Paul’s  and Jr Bandits all played away games there in the 90s....played some pickup there too. Loved that rink, saw slapshot Al there once hanging out with his sick skullet there too!"
"Only played there once, but I used to goto caps practices with my grand parents and run around collecting pucks that the players shot out.  "
"Yes! Learned to skate and play hockey there ‘til I was ten and we moved to the eastern shore (that was 1995). We would go to see the Caps practice a lot and wait in the parking lot afterwards and get their autographs. 

It was crazy to me how much they had built up around there later on. When I moved the rink was pretty much surrounded by woods. The next time I went there was my senior year and it was all developments."
I know a guy who's an expert on Ovechkin signed memorabilia *calls Ovechkin personally*.  I wonder if something like that's ever happened.
They've been playing on the same line for most of the season

"I 100% agree with you. Dudes one of be best players to watch on be ice, loves the game. I want him to win a cup, and very soon. He’s easily top 3, if not the best goal scorer of all time, so he deserves a cup. "
We need to send both Ovi and Lundqvist to Vegas to create a super team and get them both a cup.
"As a Flyers fan, I'll obit root for the Caps after the Flyers are eliminated from the Playoffs for this reason. Same with Lundquist and the Rags. 

It'll be a shame if neither of them win a cup."

"and of course the dummies from the previous generation saw it as a negative instead of embracing his love for the game.

""Act like you've been there before"" ""just do your job""

fuuuck you - these guys get paid millions to *play a game* - let them react the way your inner child would if he got to achieve his dream. Go apeshit when goals get scored. *Have fun*. That's the whole damn point of sports!"
"I think their loves are different in a way - to give it a weird analogy:

Hockey with Crosby is like a highly trained German Shepard drug/police dog on duty - its sole focus is to accomplish its mission and it gets total joy and fulfillment from doing so. It's an obsession.

Hockey with Ovi is like a Golden Retriever with its favorite toy - it's the happiest fucking thing in the world in a more unbridled, if more undisciplined, way. It's *the* source of joy for him."
"Crosby reminds me of Brady, they both seem to embrace the entire grind, dedicating every day of the year to being the best. They both seem so focused, with a little bit less of the Ovechkin reckless wild athleticism"
"Likewise on the bias, Patrick Kane may have the most knowledge of the history of the NHL outside of Pierre. "

you're right! I feel like the league in general is lucky to have a guy like Ovi."
He has seriously done incredible things for the whole entire D.C. area. Hockey has grown enormously around dc and I probably wouldn’t care about hockey let alone started playing it if it wasn’t for ovi. That doesn’t even bring all the philanthropy and shit into play. I seriously love that man so fucking much 
"The earlier post about stamkos and OV which being the better sniper kind of puts it into a great view.

OV is 250 goals ahead of stammer, but only 334 games behind. That means if stamkos wants to catch where OV is in as many games, stamkos has to beat his career high in goals in a season THREE FREAKING TIMES in the next seasons. Absolutely insane."
Didn't Joe Sackic injure himself snowblowing his driveway before the playoffs like 10 years ago? xD
"Thank sweet Jesus, the Avs only play him twice a year. It's so frustrating watching the PK against the Caps. They just cycle, and pass to Ovi, who houses it. Same damn shot, again and again. One time, Varly straight shot over so fast, it would have been an empty net for the passer. The puck gets to Ovi and Varly is 5 feet away from the crease and completely sold out to stop the shot... Ovi peeks it past his shoulder and goes top cheddar. "

The Yankees have sort of done that in baseball (as I'm sure you know) and didn't always win. Really more often than not didn't win. Everyone talks about them winning all the time but their huge team of all-stars went I think 10+ years without even being in the championship or later rounds of playoffs.

Alex Ovechkin. Also a nice guy. Also tries hard. Also loves the game.
"I hope he's out in the second round every year.

I certainly appreciate the player, but fuck my rival teams. I never want to see them win. You people are crazy."
plz no
Prepare to cut your balls off he has 300 to go.
"Ovechkin reinvigorated the franchise and made people EXCITED to watch hockey.  

I love how much he loves the game. Dude gets just as happy when his teammates score. Even more so when it's Backstrom usually."
What a delightfully imaginative and yet somehow accurate description.
That is actually a pretty accurate analogy. And pretty spot on for both Ovi and Sid. 
Damn you nailed that!
Doughty is pretty similar to OV in that regard. 
Somewhat ironic considering german shepards appear to be Ovi's favorite dog.
This is too perfect.  Well done.
Great comparison. Also works for Brady and Gronk!
I'll agree there. Ovi has been skating brain first into plays since he came into the league. 
Ovi = Gronk?

dude wtf?!
I would like to see them beat the Rangers and then the Pens if they're going to go on a cup run.  It will never happen though.  The Rangers stink
"I think that's the best way to do it tbh.

Otherwise you get a team with people like McDavid, MacKinnon, Price, Karlsson, Stamkos, etc"
"Impressive list you put together so quickly. Just to give a couple names I thought of while reading it: Price, Subban, Pacioretty, Parise, Karlsson"

"Please carry Iggy as the 13th forward. I know he's not ""active"", make me care. "
"I don't know how Phaneuf is on that list but Giordano isn't. If Phaneuf hadn't played in Toronto or maybe even Canada, I don't think there's any way his profile would be so high. 

Also, Plekanec should be at C, not on the wing."

Miles away Kessel awakens from a deep sleep. 
Hey I never said I want him to win on the Caps. Maybe he can come over to the good team in a couple seasons when his contract is up. 
"Come on, can’t this be the one thing are two teams agree on. "
Hel make it bar he has a career ending injury. 
More coke tho
Gronk more just seems to love life in general. Maybe Julian Edelman.
"'By all estimations, it took Crosby a little more than three minutes, including being interrupted by the media, following the final buzzer to line up for the handshake, and that was way too long for Lidstrom, so he left the ice.'

He died about a month ago.
"... Honestly I partially attribute his decline to him being a better rounded individual. As weird as that sounds, I feel like he's lost his ""Captain Serious"" mentality where it was winning over EVERYTHING. As a person, I think that's probably a positive development, as a hockey player, less so."

"I mean the Caps are obviously rivals, but it's not so much because I hate them. More so because we each have two of the best players in the world so every game has this heightened level of competitiveness, but not a hatred. Philly and the Islanders on the other hand, I hope never find success, cuz fuck them. "
"I'm not saying I want us to lose. Hell if we win every cup between now and the death of the universe that would be ideal. But you can't win every one, and if the Caps do win a Cup, I'd like them to have to go through us and some what make up for some of those years. Build the rivalry some more. Unless everyone enjoys one sided playoff rivalries more than me. 

But at the same time fuck the Caps."
winning the previous 2 years in a row probably helps...
"Yuck, who would want those players when you could have the Sedin twins!"
"Yeah, I put an arbitrary age cut-off at 30 which disqualified Subban, Patches and Karlsson. I went with Lu and Lundqvist over Price due to tenure, and think Parise is a worthy addition, though I wasn't sure who to remove in favor of him (Vanek maybe?)
"
"Oh yeah, I guess he's technically not an active NHLer which is why I missed him."
He would be in over Vanek for sure if I rewrote the list!
"Giordano: 740+ games, 370+ pts
Phaneuf: 950+ games, 480+ pts

I think Gio > Phaneuf is a totally valid opinion to have, but I don't think it's as obvious a choice as you think.

There were more centres than I could fit so I threw a few in as wingers (e.g. Fisher too)"
"If it were only 83 more seasons, I wouldn't have put the question mark."
"As a Caps fan in Denver, hell yes. "
Now I'm imagining him on the 02 red wings... What a perfect squad.
6 consecutive 50 goal seasons?

And here I thought his decline was him almost being 30
"I don't know Toews much at all but I could understand this sentiment. Almost as if he knows there's more to life than the NHL? There's a type of ""Kool-Aid"" lots of NHLers drink and he doesn't seem to be one of them."
"Also, while it’s easy to sit here as an American and say “Putin is a dictator who suppressed all opposition”, a large number of Russians honestly believe their lives have gotten better during his reign. If their lives have tangibly and noticeably improved with him in power, there’s not a lot you can say/do to convince them he’s not a great president/prime minister. 

When I lived in Bosnia, a lot of older people were nostalgic for the days of communism and Tito, with the reasoning something like “people say many things were bad and inefficient, but the standard of living for our family was better”. I imagine it’s kinda the reverse in Russia, with older people telling their kids/grandkids “ever since Putin came to power, things have gotten so much better, here are some examples of how it used to be” "
"I have no problem with anyone loving their country. But that Putin Team stuff, and Ovi's close relationship with that guy, who everyone knows murders his political rivals, is extremely questionable. I don't know anything about his community involvement. If it's all legit, that's awesome."
"After game 5 of the Nats Cubs series last season, I told a Cub fan friend that Bill Murray would pitch against LA.

You tried that before.
That's the difference between /r/hockey and so many other social media pages for hockey. Anytime the NHL Facebook page posts something about the Caps I give it a quick like but refuse to open the comments.
"I get what you’re saying, I’m just giving you a hard time for the way you worded it. I wouldn’t be “happy” with it, but it may be the best of a shitty scenario"

Came here to say I’d add Parise over Vanek. Very good list though
Don’t remind me :’( 
"Phaneuf started his career with a bang and gained a reputation he never quite lived up to. Undrafted, unsigned Giordano began his career the opposite way. In basically every facet of the game I think that both conventional stats (over the last 5 years, at least), advanced stats, and the good ole eye test indicate that Giordano is a much better player and a legitimate first-pairing defenceman, if not #1."
"Man, that late '90s early '00s period was unfair...

Let's go back"
Jagr plays at 46. Ove can do it for 10 years and have 30 goal seasons 
"He probably has another two 50s in him. He could probably play another 8-10 years if he stays in good health. 200 goals in 6 seasons isn't that bad. Hard to imagine him scoring under 30 until the last year or two of his career. 

Now obviously it's very unlikely, but giving up when it's well within his command doesn't seem like something he'd do if he can help it."
No one declines sharply due to age at 29. It's gonna be a combination of things.

"
"Its scary how good Nashville could be all that fire power, and all reports I’ve seen say that he will be joining them as soon as the KHL playoffs are over. Where do you even put him assuming you keep 9-92-33 together. If it wasn’t for the run Vegas is having Poile would probably get GM of the year again. "
"God damn it Eeli stop scoring already.
We want you here in Nashville bb."
Does anyone know how he slipped to 30th? Most of the the pre-draft rankings I saw had him around ~15th. 
Nashville wants him to stop scoring for Jokerit so they lose and he can come over. 
You still haven't seen our final form yet.
I don't like the idea of the predators getting better soon!
Conn Smythe incoming 
"At some point, he has to fight Ehlers for the 'Electric Eeli' nickname."
this is now /r/tolvanen
"Or replace Ekholm with Josi, Ellis, or Fiala 🍆💦"
Please give us Subban back 
Crazy that Tolvanen's shot is even close to some of the best snipers in the NHL. (By the way I am not even close to suggesting Tolvanen's shot is better than Forsberg based on KHL games).
Probably on the third with Bonino and Järnkrok or on the second with Turris and Fiala/Smith. I’d say preferably on the third to not to mess with the chemistry
"My guess would be

Forsberg - Johansen - Arvidsson

Fiala - Turris - Smith

Bonino - Jarnkrok - Tolvanen

Hartman - Fisher - Sisson/Watson/Hartnell

I could also see Lavy putting either Forsberg or Arvidsson with Bonino and Jarnkrok on the third line since that would keep it as a defensively sound line, and then placing Tolvanen on the top line in whichever ones place. 

I also wouldn't be surprised if he starts in the AHL, at least for a couple games. Dude has played a lot of hockey, and throwing him into an NHL lineup right away might be a bad thing. Bennett was kind of ruined when he was thrown into a hard-nosed playoff series at 18. "
"Oh, no, he now leads the sport in all time wins by a GM, he's gonna get GM of the year."
"~15 was the expected area.

Then due to school credits not transferring or something, his plan to play for Boston College fell through and teams got cold feet on a pick with no plan.

Combine that with some teams seeking out specific positions, and he falls to 30th.

[Between 15th and 30th, not including Eeli, there were only two wingers drafted](https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_2017_entry.html). Most teams sought Centers or Defensemen (6 of each picked.)

"
Something to do with college course credits? It could've turned into a game of Telephone where it turned into character issues somehow.
The consensus opinion is that he didn't have the required credits to play at BC bc his guidance counsellor screwed him over in HS. This was announced right before the draft and made GMs nervous.
"Some are, for sure, but I just don't want him to get hurt.

If we don't get him until next year, that's reduced risk of losing another great player in another expansion draft."
"Ellis should always be on the first PP unit in my opinion.
Dude has an absolute rocket of a shot. "
Fiala is clearly the piece that our D core is missing
no 
he is though
"It’s not really that crazy.  Every elite sniper had an insane shot at that age.  Ovechkin, laine and stamkos all had better shots at that age."
That’s kinda what I was thinking. Jarn and Bonino are pretty good on D so it would allow him to focus on offensive side knowing he has good line mates to cover his back. 
I've heard they may put him on the second line with Turris and Fiala. I'm sure Lavi will do plenty of experimenting 
I'd try something spicy and put him with Hartman and Fish/Bonino and see what happens. The first 2 lines seem to do well enough that if we found another line with insane chemistry without breaking up the first 2 lines it would be ridiculous when it comes to offensive power.
I’d keep Bonino at centre since that’s where he has the most experience and Jarnkrok does better as a winger but other than that I dig this.
I'm not sure Fisher is a lock for that 4C spot. I still really like a 4th line of Hartman - Sissons - Watson for the speed and checking.
"I at least want to see this for one game:

Forsberg - Johansen - Arvidsson

Fiala - Turris - Smith

Jarnkrok - Sissons - Tolvanen

Hartman - Bones/Fish - Watson/Hartnell

But at this point I think we could just roll like an open hockey bench and have guys come off when they get tired and the next guy in line is up. I’m comfortable with any player playing with any other player."
I am willing to be wrong on this but I believe that Tolvanen has to play one game in the NHL to be eligible for the playoffs. I recall hearing something about this with Sobokta for the blues last year ? Might be a little different because Tolv is on his ELC
Doubtful. No one saw Vegas being this good. 
"Respectfully disagree. All time wins by a GM is a career thing. GM of the year is just for this year. While Nash is having another amazing year, the team was largely in place and full of superstars. All he really did this year was get Fisher to come out of retirement and trade for Hartman. Which don’t get me wrong is impressive but GM GM took a team that didn’t exists last year and is going to win his division. GM GM And Gallant are locks for Coach and GM of the year. "
"Also is just a great passer.

Fuck I love your team."
"Stood behind the glass at practice a few weeks ago.  Every time an Ellis shot hit the glass, my ears rang!  Whole new respect for goalies."
And he's pretty freaking fast for a defencemen.
Yes! Ellis needs to be on the PP.
Using a forward at the point on the PP is something that's been done by quite a few teams. 
Tolvanen -  Bonino / Fisher - Hartman sounds fun
I don't think it matters. McAvoy only played playoff games last year.
"Honestly, i don't feel like that is because the GM is amazing, i just think the player pool option was that stacked. Obviously he had to choose them but we will have to see if the people who decide this disagree and think he deserves it. (not saying Poile should be GM of the year just not sure i buy into vegas gm being it either)."
"And trade for Turris.

But Poile did win last year, so I would guess he's less likely to win again this year."
Yeah Ellis is a tremendous passer.
"And let's not forget this:

https://youtu.be/N5RQUgNW0bQ?t=57s"
It's because he's so small. Less wind resistance. 
And we’ve been doing it for a while this year. 
"Yeah we seem to have Subban as the solo D man on a lot of PPs

Idk why thinking Fiala could replace Emelin immediately popped into my head"
"yeah, and we were gonna bring Vesey over just for the playoffs. they don't have to play in the regular season first "
He chose a very questionable group of players in the eyes of most people and it ended up being an incredible decision. Poile would win in almost any other year but it would be very surprising if McPhee didn’t win. 
Jeez that happened so long ago thought it was last season XD. Still have to give the edge to GM GM Nooooooo one saw VGK coming. 
Hobbits are known for less wind resistance
"Looks like we're seeing them going right now, though. "
I'd say RV is the Hobbit. Ellis is a dwarf through and through. 
Very dangerous across short distances. 
"I was going to say that 36% seems high, but then I realized the Blues are only like 2 points and two teams out of WC2

"Hi Reddit!

Posted this at the beginning of the season and about midway. If this post violates guidelines, then I apologize. Just want to keep you guys updated on how the simulation is going and how the odds are looking right now!

Here's some info on the project. I hope you guys like it and (hopefully) use it throughout the next season and coming seasons.


**Methodology**

Using a Python script, Elo ratings are calculated for each NHL team and the end result of the season is collected. This simulation is run 100,000 times which gives a reasonable approximation for playoff chances and Stanley Cup win percentages.

The Elo ratings are calculated starting from the 2013-14 NHL season. This is due to the current playoff format being dated back to that season. I plan to include past seasons up to the 2005-06 NHL season in the near future. The Elo ratings are used to calculate expected win percentage for each game.


**Motivation**

The motivation for creating this project was very personal. I have been an avid hockey fan for many years and I have always been interested in statistics in the game of ice hockey. To be able to be involved in the world of hockey and create these insights is something that I am proud of. I am hopeful that others will find this data interesting and useful. The main value of this project is to be able to check it every morning after a night with NHL games and see what your favorite team's current chances are.


**Future Plans**

* Views from season to season

This link is very informative: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system. Elo is a simple rating system that is, at its core, based on wins and losses. However, in order to fine-tune it for hockey, I had to mess around with the formulas a bit. I account for goal differential when assessing the impact of a loss/win on a certain team's Elo rating.

If you read the wikipedia article on Elo, then you'll have seen something called a K factor. For the NHL, I used 8. This is a fairly low number, since one game out of an 82-game season shouldn't have that much of an effect on a team's rating. However, a playoff game counts for more than a regular season game in my simulation.

Also, the Elo ratings carry over from season to season with a regression to the mean. One key thing to note is that players have nothing to do with the rating. If Sidney Crosby or Alex Ovechkin got injured, the rating system would have no idea until they started losing because of it.

If you have any other questions, please ask and I'll be more than happy to help.

Now for the posts claiming a team is mathematically eliminated followed by someone spending hours figuring out one obscure scenario where that's not true.
"Well that's the difference between playing in the East and the West/Central currently :(. Also, not getting OT/SO losses is pretty much killing us. 1 more win but 5 less points than Anaheim is kind of brutal.

"It's hard not being too negative right now. Or too positive. The past coulple of days have been a roller coaster for me.

Yesterday I was all ""we fucking suck, lets just lose as many games as possible and try to get a top ten pick.""

But today, I'm all ""We are two points out of the WC, let's kick it into gear and make the playoffs.""

Hopefully we make the playoffs."
It’s what Yeo does as a coach.. you skid but somehow are still in a playoff hunt so you don’t know whether to tank or try 
Technically and mathematically...
Avalanche are clearly still hurting from last season's data. Probably better if you reset Elo at the beginning of each year
"Excellent work!  I'll take the numbers sleeping on the Sharks at 4% and hope they outperform them.

Would incorporating an individual player stat like VORP influence the projections to be more accurate?

Is there an individual player stat that can be combined on a lineup-by-lineup basis (to account for player injuries/illnesses, healthy-scratch/goalie rotations, and AHL callups) that can be used to calculate a matchup comparison (TOI vs player X, per say) and create a more accurate game-by-game projection?  Or is that all too complicated for little or no gain in statistical significance?"
"Thank you for this description.  For a while there, I was thinking that ELO stood for Electric Light Opera."
nice
"Big thing to realize here: this is from 100,000 runs of a simulation. So, it is theoretically possible that a team **does** or **doesn't** make the playoffs in another run of the simulation. This does not guarantee any mathematical elimination or clinching."
Im just relieved we will know someone at this missed the playoffs party
"It’s amazing how like a week ago we are at more than 50% and now it’s almost a 10% chance. 
Team just amazes me. "
"I guess for a while when we were showing like 20% chance of making the playoffs, there was a glitch in one of the models that a lot of sites were using that caused us to plummet. I guess someone in twitter recently called it out and we shot up like 50%"

Watch next year we go 1-2 in the division and meet in the playoffs like old times......old times being two years ago lol"
"Sure we might be almost in the postseason, but even if we make it, we'll be the easiest teams to beat, hands down."
"I was optimistic a week ago, and now I hope we tank the rest of the season."
"After each season, I regress the team's Elo to the mean (1500). However, if you have a really bad season (sorry) it can mean that your Elo takes a big hit, regardless of the regression to the mean."
I think you mean orchestra? If you are referring to the band 
stahp it
"Yep - hopefully it didn't come off as me accusing it of that, nowhere does it represent itself as a guarantee. I just know the cycle of things and people will be posting mathematical eliminations after every loss by a team near the bottom of these standings around this point in the season."
"Hey, you didn’t go 1-2 in the division two years ago 🤔🤔🤔"
Q will have another crotch grab moment that will rally the team while being down late in game 1 and go 16-0 in the playoffs. Then my drugs wear off
Have you considered regressing each team 100% (starting them all at 1500)?
Shh I don't want to remember it any differently
"It's a valid argument, but **generally** teams stay around the same level from season to season, with a slight change. I wouldn't look to do that, but maybe I could regress to the mean further than I do now."
"It's just a thought. By the time playoff odds are relevant (50-70 games into the season), there should be a large enough sample size to distribute the elo rankings and make last year's data irrelevant/unnecessary

NFL elo ratings are forced to work with such a small sample size (playoff odds are relevant within 9-10 games), that last year's data is necessary to have a dataset. But for NHL, you can get away with using just this season.

I'm biased though because my team was dogshit last year"

Remember a time when if you hit an opposing player his teammates didn't all in unison turn to the ref with hands up crying for a call but instead turn towards the hitting player and a brawl started?  Claude Lemieux remembers.

"This hit was really bad, concussion-wise. Lots of rotational acceleration on the head. I wouldn't be surprised if Nielsen is done for the season."
"As someone without a horse in this, I don't see too much in this.  It is definitely late.  His skates come off as he hits which is normal, not a leap.  The hit is high but, I wouldn't say the PPoC is the head.  It looks more like high chest from the too angles I saw.  I don't know off hand of any suspension history that would apply.  

Fine and call it a day?

That being said, 5+ suspension incoming.  "
David Backes throwing a dirty hit? What are the odds?
I hope marchand gets 5.
Probably sits for 1. Deserves at least 2. No reason for him to clip like that. Could've bodied him through his shoulder but decided for some reason to clip him high in the face/chest only... dumb.
I'm hardly surprised.
He got 3 games.
"Wheel was spun to determine a hearing was necessary, let's spin it again! 

These are reaching goaltender interference levels of fuckery. "
"Wakey wakey Backes, you can't do that."
DoPS is a massive joke.
Ridiculous. 
"A hearing for interference? What the actual fuck. No head contact and yet a hearing.

LOL Hornqvist."
"Bullshit, Backes barely hit the man, just because a guy goes down you have to have a hearing? Shit happens, it's a violent game. "
"whaaaaaat, that wasnt dirty or intentional at all"
lol get fucked shitter
"What was wrong with that hit? He stepped to the left to not hit the guy from behind, and kept his hands down. I mean, to me it looks like pure shoulder on shoulder contact. Maybe the little jump was a bit unnecessary"
"late, but i don't see any head contact, at least any where the head is the principal point of contact"
God I can’t stand NESN. 
"Yeah they are both bad hits. Just because the NHL messed up on one doesn't mean Backes gets a free pass, it's a bummer in the short term for the Bruins but it obviously makes sense"
the difference was the lateness. most i could see here is a small fine
"Yeah this completely. Coming from a Bruins fan, I won't complain about Backes being suspended because it wasn't a good hit. I'm not totally sure Hornqvist deserves a suspension but the consistency should be enforced by making punishments universally higher not lower. It sucks but priority one needs to be making the game safer so we don't have players brains becoming useless by 50. "
RNG
"McAvoy didn’t go down, and Backes isn’t a Penguin."
"If you acknowledge your homer goggles, I will, too.

Hornqvist's hit wasn't good, but if you're looking for the difference, that one was a mile away from the play. McAvoy was about 2 feet from the puck and was actively trying to play the puck about a half second before.

edit: McAvoy was also leaned over a ton - Nielsen was standing up."
It's much much later.  
Or the hit on Carlo that took him out of the playoffs last year?
Yeah it wasn't that great of a look for him. He let a lot of punches in too during his fight because he knew he was in the wrong. A combination of that and a fine is acceptable to me.
The only thing the Turtle remembers is falling directly to the ice with his arms covering his head.  His teammates took the punishment for him ninety percent of the time.
The hit was so far away from the play that nobody knew that it happened. 
"I agree. 

Worth pointing out that Erickson did fight Backes later...punishment did not fit the crime."
"Grapes even shit on players that whine to refs, although that's expected. He told them to go play in Europe if they can't take a hit. Amusingly, his example was Backes wanting someone to answer the bell for his hit and they tried to hide behind a ref. Was really sad."
"The fact that it was late might be the driving point. The head also looks like the only point of contact other than maybe grazing the body. 

Being fair, the hit doesn't look malicious other than being late. I'd be content with a game. If he had gotten a 5 and a game misconduct, probably would've just been a fine and a ""don't do that again""."

"Yeah that did not look good. Even though I don't think Backes was trying to do anything too dirty here and didn't hit him that hard, this is the type of hit they need to get out of the game. Unnecessary, late, from the blindside, and to the head of an unsuspecting player.

Hope it wasn't as bad on Nielsen as it looked."
they should probably suspend Brady again too then...
Get.  Fucked.
It was clear head contact and Nielsen was immediately out for the game(and most likely longer).  
He jumped up and made head contact? Which one did you watch?
He hit him in the jaw long after the puck was gone...
the hit was both High and Late with the only point of contact looking to be the head. You cant do that.
"It is a physical game, it isn’t a violent game. "
This is rich when you consider all the crying Bruin flairs when Ritchie laid out a clean hit on Backes.
I guess Marchand is rubbing off on the rest of the team.. lol 
It was an unnecessary hit and it was late and high. Maybe not suspension worthy but it should be looked at. (Bruins fan just don't know how to change my flair from the old ECHL team)
"It is, but when you jump into a guy - even if slightly - and clip him in the head, you can still expect a call from DOPS."
"Late hit with contact to the head. Nielson is also injured (which factors into potential punishments)

Probably not intentional, but not a clean hit."
Username checks out.
Little jump and contact straight to the jaw. 
Fuck the habs.
"I'm French and I can't even stand RDS and TVA Sport, can't even believe how bad it is for you. "
It's nice that since the Pens ditched Steiggy I can safely say my broadcast team isn't the worst out there anymore.
"Mar-SHANNN. PAASSStrinAAAAAK. Its very cringe. I don't mind their knowledge-level its nice to hear the game from a different perspective but holy shit are they biased. They hate calls on the B's more than the players do. If you are a commentator, you need to keep that stuff to yourself."
Yea that’s why I mentioned that doesn’t excuse Backes for that hit. Just me venting in general. 
"But Backes also didn't throw a flying elbow to the head, he went for a clean hit and made head contact"
Backes had a -5 luck modifier 
*Backes isn’t a Penguin. 
Do we REALLY need to discuss Marchand avoiding suspensions again?
"tHe NhL fAvOrS tHe PeNs. 

"
Really? What about Marchand avoiding suspensions? Or are you just trying to be cute for fake internet points. 
Anyone have a video of the Hornqvist hit? I missed it live and I didn't see it get posted here. 
"Charlie was leaned over for quite a while before Hornqvist hit him. It's not like he changed his head position just before he got hit, he was looking for the puck a good 3 seconds before he got hit."
"Gonna have to disagree, I don’t care who you are you don’t just let people punch you in the face, even if you know you’re wrong."
I think we could be friends
"Reminds me of the joke:

""What went through Claude Lemieux's mind after he was cold cocked by McCarty?""
""McCarty's knee"""
Love the bastard 
Yup. Everyone was looking at where the play actually was and probably figured this was a shoulder to shoulder hit. 
"Did Neilsen ever even have the puck? I was watching the game, and don't remember him ever touching it on that play. Such a shitty hit by Backes.

Edit: Nevermind, I see it now. I don't think it was that late, but you have to actually make good contact. That was all Neilsen's head."
"Good on him, that is how you respond to a shit hit, not the chicken wing shit the Pens pull"
"Poor Grapes...he's like the last man standing on an island telling everyone the world is flat as they board a ship and sail to the New World, and I don't say that as a bad thing, but the game he loved, the game I loved, is no longer the game being played.  I remember when Kevin Maguire started something with Stevie Y, huge brawl...what did Probert do???  Not stand around with his hands up crying to the refs (who had him tied up), no he broke free, ran to the pile, hung around the edges trying to find an opening to get to Maguire (even punched Barasso a couple of times because he got in the way) and when he got his opening he drilled him.

If you rely on the refs/league to dish out the punishment you'll never get satisfaction.  I'll get off my caveman soapbox now."
His feet leave the ice though which makes it worse
they will look if it was targeting which is def isnt
Thanks!!
"Backes is the kind of player though who has lost the benefit of the doubt during his career, as this isn't the first time he's done this. Unnecessary, late, blindside hits to the head of an unsuspecting player are what he does.

"He most certainly did not jump up and make head contact. It was the upper chest after looking at all 4 angles. Both feet were planted on the ice on first contact. Anytime you spin, your feet come off the ice for re-positioning specially when you're off balance like he was.

So I ask you, what sport did you watch?"
I certainly wasn't crying. Real fans don't cry over missed penalties. 
"but completely accidental, that hit happens 40 times a game, just barely bumps him after the guy makes a pass, just a freak accident the way niels turned and got his chin clipped."
Not to mention way too late
"This season, yes.

"So you can’t hit a guy playing the puck because his head is down? That would change the whole league. Everyone could just skate with their head down and be totally immune to hits! 

Keeping your head up is the first thing you learn. Mcavoy made a rookie mistake and probably learned his lesson. "
Don't know why salty ass Pens are downvoting this. Hornqvist didn't even line McAvoy up until his head was already at the point of contact 
"Weird, I had the opposite interpretation. Late hit, but it was more of a body hit with accidental contact. "
"[Found the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vILwtRytZqU)

Obviously, Grapes over-exaggerates there but in a contact sport, collisions will happen and emotions will rise over them. If someone is gonna keep checking your teammate, you have stand up for them and if you are gonna be a pest, you better be ready to answer for it. 

Course Grapes loves the Bs and any reason to shit on the Habs for him is great."
"I don't think most people assume it was targeting, but the hit was a solid 1.5-2 seconds in real time after the turnover was made. In the playoffs the lateness wouldn't be considered strange, but in the regular season that's a call 9/10 times.

If this is anything more than a fine I'd be surprised though- one game seems to much, and a minor penalty was called on the play. Those things usually don't result in suspensions, but considering there's little consistency from the DPS we can't say for sure.

Most of the angles show the POC was high chest, but the follow through catches Nielson's chin. This isn't as much about the POC though- it's about slightly leaving the feet and throwing the hit late."
"Solid retort, bud. Keep winning."
You must be fucking blind
"Sorry man, but force of impact isn't why Backes left his feet on that one.  He was already coming up in the air before contact.  Not a huge jump, but he wasn't planted on the ice either.

This is an actually interesting call for DOPS, I think.  Backes did a number of bad things:  late hit, high hit, left his feet.  But none of them were flagrant on their own.  Really just a combination of small factors resulting in something bigger.   Perhaps he gets off with a fine. Seems the most reasonable to me.  But certainly not more than one game."
He did an ice dancing jump right into his face. There was no force that lead him to hit his face and then leave his skates. Sorry your fav team is bawstan.
"Accidental most likely, but if Nielsen would have turned the opposite way it would have been a full on hit to the head, luckily Nielsen began turning to his right and didn't take the full force to the head. Backes clearly left his feet before the hit too."
I think backes got lucky it was so late...the refs weren't really looking right at it or it might have been 5 and the game

Brick's one of the best color guys in the league. There's a reason he keeps popping up on NBC broadcasts.
Hahaha love Pens fans. Hornqvist should have got nothing right? Fucking dirty cunt. Hopefully McAvoy gets a shot in on him and puts him out of commission for a bit 
He went for shoulder on shoulder and Nielsen turned (probably because he wasn't expecting a hit to be coming) at the last minute 
I hear ya. You’re exactly right though. 
"Marchand didn't just trip Kronwall - he slewfooted him 50 feet from the play.

"If you do it 5 times and only getting suspended/fined once, then yes."
"We he does this shit multiple times a season, yes it I avoiding it"
Not a blindside hit and McAvoy has his head down. If you suspend Hornqvist you are telling players to skate with your head down because you can’t get hit.
"Probably gonna get blasted for this, but I don't see the issue.   Mac is illegible to be checked there but has his head down. Probably why Horny didn't get fined or suspended,  or even penalized. "
"I don't think it was as egregious as some Bruins fans made it out to be, but McAvoy had already played the puck and it was back in Penguins' possession. I would agree with a 2 minute roughing or interference call. No need for fines or suspensions, though."
"In today's nhl yes, you cannot make a hit where the head is the principle point of contact and the onus is on the hitter to avoid the head, not the hitee to keep his head out of the play."
"I think what pissed me off the most about that whole ordeal, is that McAvoy took it upon himself to get Hornqvist back when he had the puck. Then fucking Malkin has to come in and get involved.  Shit man, Hornqvist is a big guy, do you not trust him to settle his own debt with a 20 year old kid?"
You can't hit him in the head just because his head is down. Hornqvist fucked up and didn't learn shit and will cheapshot people again in the future.
"the principal point of contact cannot be the head.  that's the rule.  what is hard to understand about that?

If a guy is in a vulnerable position you can't hit them.  This has been the case for years when it comes to board play.  You can't hit a guy with his back to you facing the boards.  Did that change the whole league and make everyone immune to hits?"
Because it's incorrect.

"And if you call the slewfooting, then Kronwall slewfooted Bergeron. He got what he deserved. The hit on Tavares was retaliating for Tavares slewfooting him and then Pasta getting boarded by De Haan I think it was. Marchand got a fine for that and actually stepped up to answer for what he did, unlike several of your players who done dirty shit and don't get jack (Cooke, Orpik, Hornqvist). Wasn't that hit by Emelin a clip? Wasn't Marchand suspended 5 games for the same hit (to the knees on a player)? Again, don't blame him there."

"
"I have long said that the Penguins are favored by the league, way before Charlie McAvoy was ever on this team. My homerism has no effect on my interpretation of that play. I actually believe those types of hits don’t warrant a suspension, but I think that in the modern climate that hit typically does get a suspension. So I find it frustrating that there is no consistency. Regardless, don’t you find it strange that Hornqvist didn’t even get a call from DOPS? C’mon man be real. Most players get something from the NHL for that hit. 

But to say that the Pens aren’t favored by the league is laughable and shows who is wearing the homer glasses in this situation. I may even say it’s natural as the Penguins have been a cash cow for the NHL. Every league’s superstars get calls in their favor (even seen Lebron James drive the lane?), and this favoritism often also gets translated to teams. Let’s recall that the NHL isn’t a local rec league that is putting on games for the community out of altruism. It’s a business so of course they favor the teams and players that contribute most to their coffers. It isn’t fair but it is most certainly natural. 

My homer glasses most certainly exist but I am not wearing them on this subject. You however look like Burgess Meredith in his first appearance on the Twilight Zone. "
I'd avoid getting involved - the worst of the Bruins fanbase came out in droves for this thread.
"This post is about a David Backes hit.  This child (OP) decided to conjure about Marchand's history of avoiding suspensions because of reasons.

But yeah there are also idiots with Bruins flair screaming about conspiracy theories, I'm not in that boat.  I just think the thread should be about David Backes and possible supplemental discipline, not another circlejerk about Marchand. "
"I don't think you understand what irony is.

Also to hell with the conspiracy theories, I agree.  Sounds like r/hockey most of the time."
"I agree, but I also think it's a penalty per the rulebook. Just 2 minutes."
"The head is the principle point of contact, but I agree with you. There wasn't really any other way to hit him unless Hornqvist straight up took his legs out, and he is definitely eligible to be checked.

Still think it was probably a 2-minute penalty for illegal check to the head, but it wasn't outright dirty a la Backes."
">You can't hit him in the head just because his head is down. 

He would've hit him square in the chest if his head was up,  rookie mistake. 

>Hornqvist fucked up and didn't learn shit and will cheapshot people again in the future.

Because he's such a cheapshot artist. Right. 
"
Yeah he could've been hit literally anywhere else and I'd be ok with it. His head position was relatively constant it wouldn't be particularly hard to hit him somewhere else and it would've gone from borderline suspension worthy to borderline a penalty. To say you can't hit someone because their head is down based on this argument is an absolute straw man. I've played hockey all my life and have played enough to know that it is very easy to hit someone in their body when their head is down as long as you're not significantly taller. Seeing as Hornqvist is shorter he shouldn't have had a problem avoiding the head and instead chose to make a reckless play.
"Hitting a guy while his head is down is rarely suspendable and is hardly even penalized. Just like when a player turns his back before getting hit into the boards it’s up to the hittee to not put themselves in a vulnerable position. 

[No penalty, fine or suspension](https://youtu.be/UvS6sWdiOUA)

Jack and Brick don't do that either.
Name one home announcer that isn't biased.
Sounds like extreme bias to me. Very unprofessional!
"You said nothing other than the only difference is that Backes was late ignoring the entire, Backes tried to at least go shoulder to shoulder and whiffed and caught some head rather than came across on a player who already had their head down trying to win a puck battle and caught entirely head"
"What? Because I have gotten to the point of hope a player is hurt because their fanbases refuses to accept a player is dirty. I have heard the same song and dance for a decade with the Pens. ""Cooke isn't dirty"" then ""Neal isn't dirty"", then ""Orpik isn't dirty"", then ""Crosby isn't dirty"", now it is ""Hornqvist isn't dirty"". 

Most fanbases realize their players aren't clean when they aren't. Just about every Bruins fan will tell you Marchand is dirty, just about every Flames fan will say that Tkchuk is dirty, just about every Ducks fan knows that Kesler is dirty, just about every Habs fan knows that Gallagher is dirty. The only two fanbases I can think of that act this way are Capitals fans and Penguins fans"
"Ooooooookay bud, make excuses for Marchand being a rat all you want. I'm certainly not here defending Matt Cooke. My apologies for not going back and watching every damn hit to get the shitty Marchand penalty exactly correct."
"Jesus, y'all Bruins fans are super salty today."

"You might not be, but the vast majority of your fanbases refuses to believe he did anything wrong. They think James Neal did nothing wrong. They think that Oprik didn't have a few hits that he got away with because ""he had no history"". And now Hornqvist did nothing wrong.

Marchand has done plenty of dirty shit in his career, but of the 5 things that you brought up that he wasn't suspended for, he was fined for 2 of them, 3 of them were retaliatory plays where someone did something reckless to him (Emelin clipping, Kronwall tripping, and Tavares slewfooting), and 1 from what I have seen doesn't exist (the Letang one)"
Today and EVERY DAY.
"This is an interesting question.

You have to consider the fact that the Penguins and specifically a superstar like Sidney Crosby bring in many new fans which increases everyone’s revenue share in a few different ways (ticket sales, tv deals, etc.) 

Why don’t the owners have a problem with Lebron getting calls? 

When everyone is making money it’s hard to affect change. "
*A Bruins fan but whatever.
The lack of self awareness in this post is almost palpable. 
"That’s absolutely a rookie mistake. If you’ve ever played any hockey with a coach this is the first thing he tells you. 

Your argument is like trying to penalize a player because he hit someone that turned their back at the very last second. You are responsible for your own safety."
That hit was also deemed ok by the league. Not sure how but it's irrelevant what this sub thinks especially when the league agrees.
That's not my fault.

"Very easy to find his unprofessional clips, I'd also like to see you pull out the times they call Marchand on his reputation, or game 7 in 2013 when they were raving about the Leafs running the Bruins out of their own building, or literally any other time the Bruins don't show up and they shit on them for laying an egg when they could be playing better.

"The only pathetic thing I see here is some random asshole online deriding millions of people simply because they have a different opinion on how biased a home announcer is. 

Jack Edwards loves the sport of hockey more than almost anyone, is incredibly knowledgeable, and he's a huge Bruins fan. That's *exactly* who I want broadcasting local game: a knowledgeable fan. They care as much as I do that the Bruins win. And that's fun. Does it lead to them with a bias for the Bruins? Sure. But it's not nearly as bad as you and other people on reddit like to sensationalize. And even if it was, *who cares*? They're our guys and we enjoy them.

You and your ilk are absolutely pathetic. Let people enjoy the fact that the biggest fan of the Bruins in the world is the one announcing. It's better than your presumed ideal of complete apathy and neutrality. "
"Okay, whatever YOU say.  

This is productive!  I countered your argument without facts just like you!"
You see the odd clip that gets posted on here pointing out homerism. We watch him call 70ish games a year. Why would anyone believe your point of view when it’s limited to 5 minutes a year vs our 150+ hours? 
"Jack isn't even the worst Boston Sports homer.

I mean have you listened to Tommy Heinsohn?

Every market has the same home team bias guys."
Redmond won't go blind when a Red Wing does something greasy.  He's a homer but he won't lie about poor play or bad hits.
"He did, McAvoy had his head down the entire time, was in a puck battle with another player and Hornqvist didn't even attempt to miss his head. Primary point and only point of contact on the hit"
"Oh I know I'm an asshole at this point, but it has been a decade of Pens fans refusing to admit how shitty their players can be that has gotten me to the point of hoping for it "
"The Pens fanbase will, by and large, tell you that James Neal fucked up a few times. I didn't say Hornqvist did nothing wrong, either. I think it was a penalty, but I don't think it's suspension worthy. And btw, neither did Chara: 
> ""It was not dirty; it was just a physical game,"" said Chara. ""Both teams are battling and there was a lot of checks and a lot of battles. Neither team wanted to back down. It was just one of those games, that it was just a matter of time.""

Marchand does not give AF about fines, so I think it's fair to list. And you retaliate with a hard hit, not a dirty play. Marchand can't hit cuz he's like 5'8"", so he gets REALLY chippy. And those are the ones I remember - I'm 100% sure Reddit could come up with more if we put our minds together.

(Also I looked at the ""Letang"" one and it was Kunitz... don't think it was suspendable for most people, but I think Marchand deserves a hearing every time he does something stupid at this point.)"
James Neal is a piece of shit.
"But Crosby isn't the only superstar in the league. Marchand is a superstar, too. By your logic the league also favors the Bruins, the Maple Leafs, the Oilers, the Blackhawks, the Islanders, and every other team that has a superstar on it."
"One brought up Hornqvist, one brought up Pens bias. More than one."
Glad you know what palpable means....
He didn't change anything at the last second though. The onus is on Hornqvist to make a reasonable effort not to hit a guy in the head. He did not do so.
"it does because look at those hits side by side. Backes's hit was a hit that happens all games, slightly bumping into someone that just passed the puck, its just a freak accident. The other hit is a direct shot to the head that led to injury."
"Its not easy to find such blatant unprofessionalism from even decent announcing pairs.  Dude has straight up cackled as loud as he could while calling opponents cowards and crybabies for high hits and boarding that wasn't called against the Bruins when they looked for a call...multiple times.  

Yeah, he can run his own team down when they are getting embarrassed...big fucking deal"
Edwards' highlight reels are full of so much unproffessionism I would beg my team to fire him.  http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/the-nhl-local-tv-announcer-rankings.html#main-content
"No, it doesnt. Nust bc he isnt thw worst in boston doesnt mean hes the same as everyone else. 

Youre just being naive to your guy, bud. 

Tell me how many broadcasters have done shit like this:

"
"> McAvoy had his head down the entire time   
   
found another difference with the hit.  youre right, horqvist is a predator out there looking to hurt people. holy shit. if a bruin threw that hit on a guy with his head down in the neutral zone you would be fully erect and jack edwards would be rambling about ""old time hockey"" and how that kid ""really learned a lesson there"". get bent."
You sound like someone that has compiled every negative interaction you've had with the penguins fanbase in your head and decided to start acting emotionally instead of rationally. Maybe get off of reddit for a few minutes. Take some breaths. Try to understand your perspective is flawed. 
Piece of shit little far? More like just a dirty hockey player?
I would argue that the fact that the Oilers have McDavid is proof the NHL doesn't play favorites.
"There are other superstars and they typically get more calls than your 4th liners and perhaps these other superstars get more favoritism from the league than those 4th liners. But no other player is the face of the league. 

What ticket is more expensive, Buffalo at Florida to see Jack Eichel play or Pittsburgh at Florida to see Crosby play? No other team and player have the juice that Crosby and the Penguins do. "
So two?
I'm glad that Google is there to help you :)
"You are focusing on the wrong part of my post. My argument in both paragraphs is you can’t penalize both instances without fundamentally changing the game.

Penalizing Hornqvist sends out the message to the player to skate with your head down because then you cannot be hit or if you are hit your team goes on the PP.  This is walking a fine line on removing hitting altogether from the game. "
"Whatever dude, if you think Jack is a shitbag that's your problem. He's owned up to bad calls in the past and even has had interesting interviews explaining why he'd rather focus on being the way he is than calling a game monotone by the book. [I don't expect you to read it, but I'll leave it anyways on the off chance you do.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alansiegel/jack-edwards-is-americas-best-and-most-insane-sports-broadca?utm_term=.burv5YpyD5#.vwwrk5D7bk)"
"I loved all of that Jack Edwards stuff.  

I do however think that sports is entertainment.  So whatever floats your boats."
This thread has taught me why the Bruins are so protective of Jack Edwards. Many of them are actually Jack Edwards.
He had his head down in a board battle trying to dig it out of the corner. He didn't even have fucking possession when Hornqvist drilled him. Go fuck your mom you inbred cunt of a yinzer 
Wishful thinking asking an irrational person to look inward. That sounds like too much to handle for this person.
Not too far at all. He intentionally kneed someone in the head.
"> No other team and player have the juice that Crosby and the Penguins do.

I'd like to see a statistic on that. Pittsburgh has a big fanbase, but I doubt they'd compare to Toronto or even New York."
"Yep, hence the plural. "
"He acknowledges his mistakes, but then doesn't really work to correct the reasons he makes such horrible mistakes...all for the theater of it.  That's why he consistently ranks as one of the 2 or 3 worst in the game."
It's funny...I think jack is a lot like marchand.  Very talented but a complete shitbag.  Says a lot that Bostonians love them both so much
"oh cool so you also dont know what possession is. i just watched it again, mcavoy literally had touched it .1 seconds before the hit. keep youre fucking head up. hornqvist doesnt even go high, mcavoy is literally staring at the ice. jesus what a typical boston tough guy. "
Ah im not defending him you're right XD
That’s true that Toronto and New York probably have a larger fanbase but of the three which do you think is more of a national team? And which has brought in the most fans in recent years? These questions just lead to the larger and more important question: who does NBC want to broadcast more the Pens or the Rangers? I’d say the Pens. 
"Don't be coy, you know you meant the majority of Bruins fans. "
"Oh he won possession after Hornqvist has already committed to his hit... while McAvoy is still getting control of the puck and he still only makes head contact.

You know what fine, hopefully next time we play, McQuaid rebreaks Crosby's neck. It would be a beautiful sight to see the NHL a much cleaner place without him slashing fingers off "
"If the NHL wanted to bring in the most money, they'd grant a generational player to Toronto and immediately start favoring them, per your logic. It doesn't make sense for the NHL to choose Pittsburgh, a relatively small city, and just hope that they'll catch on."
"Haha, you guys are really fucking paranoid. It was clearly talking about the two people specifically at the top of the thread. Reread my original post man."
haha holy shit you are so fucking salty. why do you let this shit get under your skin so much sweetheart?
"“They’d grant a generational player to Toronto”

How would they go about “granting” a player. If the NHL loses its appearance of fairness and equality (the league IS mostly fair and equal) then they would lose all credibility and with that large segments of fans. Additionally how on earth could the NHL give one team a generational talent? How many GMs have made the mistake of thinking someone is a generational talent and them being s bust and vice versa. 
"
"I mean thats just like, your opinion man.  I see nothing wrong with the top post you are referring to.

EDIT: 
> What's the difference between this hit and Hornqvist hitting nothing but head on McAvoy? So random...

Was it the ""..."" that triggered you?

"
"If you think the NHL favors the Penguins, surely you think they were granted Crosby?"
"What do you mean by “granted”? I’m not saying the NHL is rigged and Bettman has a schedule of the next five cups winners in his office. All that I’m saying is the NHL treats it’s superstars a little differently. I don’t think that they have always favored the Penguins. I think that since the Pens are good and have been the trendy bandwagon team, the NHL looks upon them... favorably. "
10/10 goal call.

Rick came on that call
His hands are dirtier than my browsing history
im gonna throw the fuck up
moments like this are how religions are born. absolute euphoria.
That’s Brayden “Overtime/SO God” Point to you 
Rick's call was almost better than the goal. 
Can’t wait to hear the Mish streamable on this with Espo going “Hwoah. *WOW!*” in the background.
I absolutely cannot wait for filthy Point goals in the playoffs.
Wow he didn't have to be so mean about scoring a game winner like that.

The Panthers died for this! What a goal! Maybe we'll stop going into OT once McDonagh plays but if we keep winning like this I'm OK with it. 
My pants just got tighter...
Oh boy that toey was on Point eh?
"It legit looked like a ""What are THOOOOOOSE??"" video in my house. Five people losing their shit. My husband turns to me after I have dramatically simulated a heart attack: ""I'm mad at him because I think he beat me in getting you pregnant."""

Brayden Point out there breaking ankles

NASTY
James harden with the cross over or something 
wow that beautiful 
"That's fucking disgusting. I love when Point fixes his helmet, Killorn looks at him like he's stupid, slaps the helmet off and then gives him the dad-messes-up-the-hair pat on the head. Killorn is moving up my favorite players off the ice list with the quickness this year."
One of my favorite plays of the year from the ridiculous move to the call - noice
I just don't see how Tampa loses this year
Filthy. Straight up disgusting.
I was at the game. The place went nuts when it went in. Having seats almost right behind the Florida bench was entertaining too for the moment.
The series between Florida and Tampa had been really fun and high scoring this year. I'm really hoping we get a first round Thundercats match up
OH. MY. GOD.
What’s the Point in hurting someone like he did Dadonov?
Commenting to save for my alone time.
Filthy
Fucking filthy
What the fuuuuuck
A toe dragging goal in a tie game in overtime... The announcers and fans losing their minds. This is why we watch!
He won the game twice there in a 10 second span. 
**ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING**

"Holy open net, ~~Batman~~ Stralman."
God damn I shit myself twice watching that 
Dat 60fps so smooth
Stammer in there moshing is my favorite part.
Someone needs to teach Dadonov how to play positional defense.
so what happened to tampas defense. i feel like every game i see in the last 1-2  months is a 5-4 or 6-5 ot game
Who was that who got toe dragged by Point? That was some horrific defense. He could've easily got in front of him but instead he tried to skate past him and poke check it.

so out of character for Peckham. I love hearing Engblom losing his shit in the background too

I think they had >45 the other night as well. They're just bombarding the net.
Every time we play the Panthers and outshoot them we lose. I think they went with a different strategy.

"[Check this screen out] (https://imgur.com/a/5R9a0). It seems like he gets a piece of the toe involved when he drags past Dado and we lose sight of the puck. I think it qualifies, maybe it's the angle, maybe it's Maybelline. "

He really earned that point.
This attempt at starting a comment chain was.... idiotic
"Lived in my neighborhood and went to elementary and jr high with him. He was always nice to me, never knew he was so fucking disrespectful, especially to Evgenii Dadonov."
I followed the Regina Pats while he played in Moose Jaw :( 
I didn't take it as a mock... It was a badass call
"Holy shit buddy, do you find anything funny?????"
"To my memory, yes. Teams had shied away from guys like Point (and Johnson before him) because of worries about their size."
"Well...that means everyone else did too, right? Third try's the charm!"
He'll let him off mowing the lawn this Saturday. 
you have been banned from r/the_gourde for your heresy

It would've looked less stable than Cloverfield's cinematography. 
"As awesome as that goal was, no one skates in saying 'I'm going to shoot while losing an edge and then when the rebound pops up I'll smack it with my stick just below the crossbar but over his shoulder to score.' Don't get me wrong, tons of skill and awareness went into being able to score that goal, but ultimately I think most people would rate that goal as a fairly lucky bounce. 



Point on the other hand scores this hosed down driveway practice drill goal where he toe drags around an orange cone before he can shoot.

And the second period...

People don't realize how much OT drains players though. Line changes are probably the most important thing in OT.

Get my ex-rangers a cup. They deserve it
"UMM EXCUSE ME WHAT ABOUT THE FLYERS GAME? WE CAN DO COMEBACKS TOO, YA KNOW?"
So that's why u/leads has never posted anything!
Evidently you missed the second period too because that was our best period.
Got to love Esposito trying to get a word in while Mishkin is signalling other planets.
I love being able to visualize on the sound bar when we score based off Dave. 
"I think that’s the first time in a while we’ve heard the pure, unbridled ecstasy in Mish’s voice that causes it to crack... you know you’ve done something BIG when that happens."
I hate when people get downvoted for being right just cause their comment is perceived to be negative. literally worst thing about online hockey forums. the move was nice. it wasn't so nice that dadonov should've flown in the other direction. take the fuckin body daddy. so preventable. barkov also completely fucked up posession in the o-zone which caused this but he's the second coming of christ so ull never hear it from our idiotic fan base. I'd normally be cool with the loser point here but cbj and devils won so its a step back. sux.
"Exactly. I think Marty really helped break that mould for us, but a lot of other teams have been slow to adapt to/adopt that style of play. Seems likely that as the league moves away from the goonery of the old days, we'll be seeing even more speedy ""undersized"" guys getting a chance in the spotlight."
you mean Thursday - he's expected to play Thursday 
Big dick Rick deserves one more.
I SEEM TO REMEMBER LEADING IN THE THIRD PERIOD IN THAT GAME TOO. 
"You mean the period where we spent the better half in our own zone?  The third was almost no different... Yeah, we scored two goals, but they out-shot us significantly.  Just because we scored twice doesn't make it our best period.  Far too many shots on Vasy, the defense is full of holes and needs to be tightened up - we got outplayed for a good chunk of that game, plain and simple."
"> Mishkin is signalling other planets.

Lost it"
Fucking take my goddamn upvote. 
Esposito?  I thought that was Teddy from Bob's Burgers
Aren't you banned from /r/floridapanthers? 
"Yeah. It will probably take us winning a cup or two for the rest of the league to get wise and draft these guys. Really, the majority of smaller guys in the league were drafted or brought in by us first, then traded away.. (Looking at you, Marshy)"
No he's not expected until at least the weekend.
Nope.
"Yeah, but not with you."
"We allowed less shots that period than in any other period. We shot more in that period than in any other period. We scored 2 goals and only allowed 1. That was our best period by all simple metrics. If you wanna whip your dick out with some advanced possession metrics, go for it champ."
That's all I'm going to hear now...

"Rielly has put up 4 points in 4 games, and has looked fairly decent. "

Then again we gave up nothing to get him, so I guess it's not a bad deal.

"**A:** Spooner, Nemestnikov have both fit right into the lineup. Spooner is great on Hayes' wing and has turned that line into a potent offensive force. Nemestnikov has held his own centering his own line, but his lack of production is more on the Ranger's barren forward lineup then his own ability. 


**B/B+:** The prospects Brett Howden, Libo Hajek, Ryan Lindgren, and Yegor Rykov are all good prospects but none really project as a bonafide bluechipper. This is a wait and see, but considering all four instantly made the Rangers Top-10 prospects list is telling. 


**D:** Rob O'Gara is Holden but without the offensive ability and also just worse. Thanks for the 3rd Boston. "
"Rick Nash: A, he’s fit great on Krejci’s wing and is a possession monster. Upgraded our 2nd line from “decent” to “really fucking good”

Nick Holden: B+, i don’t know why Rangers fans hated this guy cause he’s been phenomenal for us. He has points in every game he’s played and fitting in great playing right and left side. With McAvoy gone, he is much needed depth. 

Tommy Wingels: B+, he’s produced early and plays with a lot of energy

Brian Gionta: B, rumors of his demise appear to have been unfounded. He’s been surprisingly good, we’ll see if it lasts. If we’re healthy, he’s a scratch but for now he’s playing well and producing. 

All in all Sweeney did a great job bolstering us without sacrificing any key future assets

Wagner - C, kind of invisible. Neither good nor bad. Just a roster player that is indeed playing on the roster."
"Chris Kelly: C+ 

I didn't get the signing at the time, but he's found himself in a very favorable role. He's a PK specialist - smart player, knows how to play within his game. He hasn't been amazing or anything, but he hasn't disappointing. 

Chimera: C 

Lateral move like we expected. Overall, both moves have made Ducks a lot older, and improves the PK. 

Ducks are basically rolling 3 lines, and a 4th line that rarely doing anything but PK. "
"Hartman, A+. In 5 games he has 2 game winning goals and a couple pretty assists. And he has taken like one penalty. Pretty happy. Also for making our fourth line the best fourth line in hockey. I mean it's basically a third line"
"Phaneuf A- I mean....solid is the first word that comes to mind...I know about that contract, but he's been amazing on the blue line

Thompson B- Hasn't really lit the lamp as much as I'd like, but he's active in the offensive zone, and doesn't seem to be too bad in our end

Reider C Haven't really seen much of him....so I can't say he's been too good or bad, tbh

JEFF CARTER A++++  Ok, so we didn't technically trade for him....but, I mean...COME ON.....HE'S AVERAGING A GOAL A GAME, MAN!!!!

GKG!"
Stewart and Shore cost us basically nothing and were worth a go; we can wash our hands of both in the offseason if it's not going anywhere (it's not).
Not having Stewart has been pretty good. We did have Kunin in his place but he tore his ACL... The 4th line is noticeably better without Stewart however. Cullen and Winnik both scored last night
"How’s Plekanec doing, Toronto fans?"
Adam Henrique: :)
"Vatrano: ?

He's still injured, so who knows. There's a nice spot on the second line for him with the injury to Malgin, so hopefully he heals quickly."
"Nash (A-). As advertised. Does basically everything, even when cold. Krejci line had been awesome since.

Wingels (B). Great depth at a low cost. Love what he brings. Gives 100% every time he hits the ice. Fan favourite kind of player.

Holden (B). Surpassed expectations. Shame McAvoy is out because I really liked him and Carlo. Clearly Sweeney made a good move since Holden fills in nicely when we had injuries.

Gionta (B-). Wow, significantly above expectations. I was expecting him to be awful, but he's actually done well. I wouldn't put him above the third line, but he plays well in our depth. Still has some gas in the tank."
"A

Pretty minor acquisition but Reilly's been great so far. 4 points in 4 game. He makes good passes and is pretty confident in his play "
"Kempny: B - pretty serviceable bottom 4 dman, a little weak in front of the net. good breakout guy

Jerabek: uhh..."
"Mrazek (little before the deadline but he counts): A-. He has looked really good in some games, like a franchise goalie. He's looked not so good in others, but it's hard to say what was our defense fucking up and what was his fault. Pretty solid overall. If we hadn't picked him up we would be rolling with 2 AHL goalies for the next month so in that case this move gets an A+.

Not doing anything stupid: A+"
"Letestu: B+ Big goal in his first game back home, great chemistry with Calvy, great leadership.

Vanek: C he is adjusting and it shows, but I think he will be a big help in the last 15.

Cole: A+ huge leadership role accepted already, great chemistry with Savvy and has brought his game up, couple of points as well. 

Jarmo did great and didn't give up too much."
F.Round-pick hasnt made the team yet
"Gaborik: C, About as expected from him

Money Saved: A+"
"Brassard: B+ Great presence on O and D. Creating scoring chances and building chemistry with Kessel that will be key to 3 great scoring lines

Oleksiak: C Big body and smooth skater but not using his body to clear the crease leading to many high chance scoring opportunities. Needs to put himself in better positions to unleash his monster shot in the offensive zone

Sheahan: No chemistry with Kuhnhackle on the 4th line, needs to get a chance with Sheary and Simon if a scoring line is what we want."
Grabner took a 2nd round pick cause of his defense
"Well McKegg was called Kegger in juniors, and Jooris didn’t have any cool nicknames so....

A+"
"Stewart - C, not much was expected and not much has been delivered. 

Shore - C+, smaller sample size but overall same as Stewart"
Maroon doesn't need speed to contribute. He's obviously slower but he has great front of net positioning. Good hands and good chemistry with Zajac. 
Hartman A+ for handsomeness
"Mrazek - B

Oduya - ?"
McKegg has 3 assists through 3 games so that's nice.... For the Checkers
"Vatrano: Incomplete (injured)
I do think the idea of getting some depth makes it a probable solid B.
The Panthers have been on a roll lately, but I feel like they're a bit shallow depth-wise. Enforcer Micheal Haley has played in all but one game for Florida."
"Miller: A+ -- 4 Games in, he has 2 goals and 3 assists.  He's getting pretty big minutes and is playing extremely well.

McDonagh: I -- It's disappointing that his timetable for a return has been pushed back a little bit.  I look forward to seeing him play, but I can't really grade it yet.
"
the 3rd round pick for maroon is really helping us reinvigorate our line up and also helping us defensively its great
Still feels weird seeing Pleks with a Leafs Jersey he needs some time to get used to the team but I'll give him a C+ he's been pretty good defensively.
grabber is so fast and great off the puck but needs to be set up. he can't do it on his own
"Chimera has been good.   
  
Kelly if he counts has been bad except for the PK where he looked good. and I want Vermeer back"
been pretty happy with brass
Oduya's been awful
"Nashville's 1st and 4th Rounder: A
Exactly as advertised, one of the bright spots of this season.

Edjsell Youtube Highlights: B+
Cautiously optimistic about this gigantic Swedish boy. Might need to learn how to spell his name eventually. 


"
All our draft picks have a lot of promise.
"Leipsic: **B+** Really works hard, never quits on plays, has caused a lot of turnovers with this speed and ability to stay on guys. Has been getting sweetheart minutes though, and defensively I haven't seen much to give him a higher grade.

Motte: **C-** Kills penalties I guess? I dunno I don't see the upside on this guy: he doesn't score, he's not particularly big or fast, and he's eating 4th line minutes that could go to a prospect.

Jokinen: **Why**"
"Greg McKegg: Leg/Arm and Arm/Leg. An improvement over Josh Jooris in the funny name game, but a step down in the bro game, does not rock a chain necklace or celly with his tongue out."
"Alt (C-) :  waiver claim in case we get more injuries on D I guess; he’s tall and is currently enjoying the nachos in the press box

Graves (C) : lateral move basically keep our deadline streak alive; traded a stalling offensive AHL Dman for a defensive one. 

Sakic (A) : I think he did really well for our position; we didn’t remove anyone since we’re in a playoff push but we also didn’t add anyone since we’re also still building for the further. We didn’t mortgage the future for old, slow guys on awful contracts, *cough, Roy, so as far as I’m concerned, we did well. "
"Bud dick Rick is amazing, and wingers is a stud. A-"
"Well, N/A I guess"
"Grade: Present

As in, we did the bare minimum by kind of showing up and doing something of no consequence"
"Leipsic: B+, isn’t very good on defense but he instantly gelled with Virtanen.

Motte: C+, he can kill penalties at least.

Jokinen: N/A he isn’t even playing"
"*nods head with appreciation* Go Paulie go.

"
"Glad Staz is doing well, he's a great player. "
Stats was the best acquisition of trade deadline. So glad he’s living up to hype. 
Still surprised you guys paid a 4th for Morrow. Hes probably gonna be let go in the summer anyways 
I'd give Morrow a C...he's been pretty average.
Morrow has been surprisingly good. Solid B+. I really don’t understand why he gets so much hate.
Also Stastny A+ because we got fantastic value in a trade for someone that we weren't going to pay that much money to. 
"We actually managed to get a point last night. As far as I am concerned, we've improved."
9 mil in cap space is an A+
And it has certainly given Coreau a chance to shine!
So glad Leipsic found a good home with his former coach. 
"I'd bump leipsic down to A- on account of some unnecessary penalties and a few giveaways. Bottom line though is he's definitely a steal for us.


I'm a Motte fan so far. Solid forecheck and penalty killer. It's funny how different he is from Vanek. "
Do we get an A because we literally turned Free Agents into Leipsic and Motte? Free potential upside
"Would have loved to keep him , took Leivo instead I’m not complaining "
I agree with leipsic but motte has had like one good shift in 3 games so id give him a C
"Wow, he sounds like a player you should re-sign once his current contract expires"
"Can't wait to see how he does with Thornton feeding him in the playoffs.

Though it was before the deadline:

Eric Fehr: B-

Filling the 4C role better than the rotating cast had been, good veteran presence to support the 4th line wingers, probably a lot of funny shit-talking and story-swapping about the '16 Cup Final in the locker room.  Low # of games played this season between the NHL and AHL means his body is in better shape than it otherwise would be at this point in the season.  Excellent trade of a very late-round pick to acquire him.  His grade took a hit b/c of injury and that he's just a placeholder until Thornton returns."
hope Evander  stays clean off ice.....guessing Thornton laid down the law on the drive home from the airport
Sure bb 
Woah that is a name i haven't heard in a while.
"He's been a bit snakebit this year, have fun with him he has a ton of skill and should very much benefit from playing with McDavid and Draisaitl"
"I really hope he does well with you guys

Always liked him, we just didn't have room for him really. Hopefully playing with McD/Drai can help"
"Ya he's better than I expected to be honest. Looks better than a good chunk of our wingers, although that's not saying much. "
His teeth died for our playoff bid. I will always be grateful for the effort that dude gave on the ice for us
Reminds me of Lander. 
"Good to hear! Hopefully he has a successful career with you guys. I still like Mikey. 

By the way, it's spelled 'Reilly'."
He's the best M.Rielly in the league
Ive been very pleasantly surprised how well he has played so far.
"An ""I"" is still a failing grade in my book, nice to see that we made moves to upgrade our offense... Oh wait? This is a first round playoff team at best"
Namestnikov*.  I miss him.
"Holden has been playing extremely well for Boston, idk the hate for him, seems like he was a steal."
The cupboard was barren. 
"I figured Spooner was going to play his best hockey in these last 20 games or so to get a nice fat contract from the Rangers.

Realistically what kind of contract would you be happy giving him? Honestly, I have my doubts he'll live up to it."
[deleted]
We didn’t like him because he should be a Third pairing guy not first 
Can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that we actually got better after the trade deadline for the first time in what feels like years?
"Holden was playoff scapegoat bc he made some bad turnovers and was deployed in the worst possible role, but he's a good, useful player. Physical, nice hands - I've actually liked how he played this season and he's definitely a great fit for the Bruins. Nice to see him and Nash doing so well"
Gionta is a lot quicker than I expected. I feel like he's buzzing around the ice whenever I see him
I miss my spicy chicken Wingels. :(
"I still think trading Nick Holden to the Rangers was a net negative for us a couple years ago. I think he got a lot of extra hate here for the positions he was put in, but he was a decent bottom pairing guy. Seems like he's only gotten better with time, too."
Glad to see Miller working out for you guys. Any chance McDonagh plays tomorrow?
"Well if it isn't my old friend Mr. McKegg, with a leg for an arm, and an arm for a leg!"
His face alone easily moves him up a half grade. He's like a young Patrick Sharp.
"With his goals against the Stars and Jets in games that were essentially decided by one point, he not only won us the game he also denied our in-conference rivals any OT points. Definitely A+ thus far."
"He's honestly been our most impactful forward so far. Not saying most talented or best, but he's basically won two games for us. I'm sure that won't last long but I had a feeling from the start he was better than this season's numbers implied. I think he'll be at least as good as Smith"
https://gfycat.com/infiniteimmaculateanchovy
"I was really worried we paid too much for Hartman but damn, he fits in so well. I love him."
"Yeah, the only reason I wouldn't give him a D or F is because he wasn't expected to put up a bunch of points playing in a defensive role for us."
I’m still happy to give him a few more games to settle in here. I think Babcock put it well that he looks like he’s just thinking too much. He’s in such an unfamiliar environment now he can’t just play like he could have years and years in Montreal. That and they’ve been on the road so much since we got him he hasn’t had much time to practice and settle in in Toronto
"MTL Trades

Plekanec A+++. MBs Tojan horse is doing his job"
Don't expect him to produce in the playoffs. He's usually invisible.
"The 4th line gets like 9ish even strength minutes a game.

Thats not that much less than most other teams. "
TIL Chris Kelly is on the Ducks
Idk why we even made any moves if you're not going to really step up the ladder. I'd rather of kept the chemistry than go for these Bargain Bob moves.
"> And he has taken like one penalty. 

And drawn two or more."
*just 1 assist
"Regarding Thompson, I wouldn't expect much scoring.  Maybe in the playoffs though.  Dude steps it up in the playoffs."
"I don't expect much scoring from Thompson that wasn't the reason for bringing him in, I give him a B/B+ because he has had a few games of absolute dominance in the Faceoff circle and has also been a very reliable pker in the absence of Lewis and shore and taking those minutes from kopi and brown...."
"He's been the very definition of OK.

"
"He took some iffy penalties and seems to be having a rough time settling in.  Hasn't been productive.   But the team has been struggling in general lately, and I don't think he's deserving of the general ripping on that he's been getting from the fans.  It's gotta be tough as hell for him to leave his family and life and try to head straight to a road trip with new teammates.

But generally, not great.  C- grade to me."
Not a deadline move but I'd say the same for Sami
"People think we did poorly at the deadline, while giving us no credit for making our big move much earlier. Not only has he been one of the best in-season pick-ups, but we also got 30-something more games of use out of him that the deadline guys."
Chimera/Kelly: :|
Is he injured or is he just scratched with you guys playing well? Don't remember him being injured when he was traded.
"I'm really surprised at how fast Gionta can skate, especially considering he is 39"
"Yeah, I don’t think anyone expects much from the Plek trade. Laval is a dumpster fire and it’ll be nice to have Rychel and (Russian D guy I forget his name) down there for possible injury call-ups. The pick was the best part even though it’s low, many people were saying he’d get a 4th and that’s it.

Reilly could be a great offensive mid pairing guy and replace someone like Benn in the long term.

I’m happy. "
"I have to wonder what is going on with Minnesota and their defense. It took Dumba forever to develop, Olofsson is injured, but has looked shaky, Brodin regressed massively, before taking a step forward. Spurgeon is the only one that has done anything decent since we've picked him up."
Has Jerabek played yet?
That's pretty much what you get with Mrazek... he'll be amazing for 2-3 games and then seem to completely lose it. Glad to hear he's been more good than bad for y'all.. 
I agree with this. Vanek has looked a bit slow and hasn't really found his place in the lineup yet but he started to look a little better last night. Hopefully he can find his game soon
"Vanek had a bit of a slow start with us too, I think. Once he adjusts he’s great though."
"I knew it was either going to be the Flyers, Caps, or Jackets that ended up with Cole, and I'm only hoping that it doesn't wind up biting the Pens in the ass. From an outsider's perspective, he's a perfect fit for CBJ so I'm happy he landed in a good place. He'll deserve that next contract regardless of who gives it to him."
Don’t forget the fourth
I have to raise the Big Rig to at least a B. His expectation coming in was a 6-7 D and he has been a solid #5.
"I agree with Brass, but c'mon, the rig has to be at least a B. he's been awesomely consistent for us. "
Sheahan was starting to get in a groove on the 3rd line but once Brassrd bumped him down to 4th his offensive production has not been then. The 4th line grinds it sometimes but they've had some goals scored against them as of late.
Oleksiak and Sheahan were NOT picked up at the trade deadline...
He stole my Hartman
I haven't been the biggest fan of Brickley. I feel like he never contributes anything when he plays.
"Huge thanks to blues, seriously. 

Almost feels like Stastny has always been a Jet."
"Worth it. Seller’s market this season, time to sell for the Blues, UFA, and I’m still bitter about the jets getting the Blues’ 1st from buffalo. "
I wonder if Armstrong made the deal with Chevy just to fuck with McPhee.
"He's insurance for the playoffs. In a perfect world, he doesn't play for us, and we don't care about a 4th."
"Ehh, if we'd paid a 6th instead there's really not a lot of difference. Chance to find an NHL player in the 4th rather than the 6th round is about the same. "
I was surprised too. Nice to get something of actual value for a player I had no interest in keeping. I still back the move by Winnipeg though. You only get so many opportunities and they're legit contenders right now. Depth going into the most grueling playoffs in pro sports is never a bad thing. 
"The Morrow situation is hilarious to me. Chevy actually wanted to acquire him in the summer, but he chose to sign with Montreal instead. So now we forced him to come to Winnipeg, also I'm pretty sure he's an rfa, so I would be surprised if we didn't sign him. "
Is that not what you would expect from a depth D addition?
Morrow is good for what you gave up. The circle jerk against him is crazy
"It's all relative - we didn't trade for him expecting him to be a top-pairing guy, we expected a 7/8 guy who can fill in for injuries. "
That game was wild. 
He was basking in a red glow fairly often.
5 points in 3 games I don't care what penalties he's taking. Plus we went 0/4 on those penalties if I'm not mistaken. 
"No we get a F because we couldnt even get a 7th round draft pick out of vanek

/s"
"1 good shift means you don’t know what you’re watching. He’s not producing offensively, but he’s playing bottom end minutes while being physical and defensively responsible. killed 20-30 seconds on the PK by himself a couple times. 

"
If he continues like this I hope so too
"I know you just want our first, but we will probably end up re-signing him from the play we've seen thus far. "
You’ll never get our 1st! We’ll sign him and stiff ya. 
"Didn’t even have to look at the flair, depending on how the rest of the season or even postseason goes I wouldn’t mind based on what I’ve seen so far "
"How about the Sharks win the Cup instead, then sign Tavares?"
"Even though he isn't a high profile impact player, I've still liked the effort I've seen him put out. Good acquisition to fill in on the 4th line, even if it's only until Thornton comes back."
I'd put money up that says he stays as 4C when Jumbo comes back. Or at least have it be his spot to lose.
I'm thinking Thornton showed him his other beard in the drive home and it freaked Evander out.
"""Evander, always do the right thing."""
"""Evander, people on reddit and twitter are gonna say you do dirty things off the ice even though they never bring this up much about  P Kane and Tyler Seguin. But we know you're a good player so don't listen to that noise"""
"Thornton is like the last dude to lay down the law. He's as laid back off the ice as guys get. Was a fucking animal in Boston, too.

If anything I bet Jumbo took Kane out and drank him under the table. And now it's a condition that if you want to party, you have to go with Joe and the memory of that evening is enough to keep Kane on the straight and narrow."
I mean he has been fine for awhile...
This is so overblown. Jesus Christ 
"He had one issue in his time in Buffalo and that was dropped due to insufficient evidence anyways. 

It seems like he finally grew up and realized he needed to just play hockey. "
Pretty sure I read that Evander and Thornton are big Vegas buddies. They party together there all the time in the off season.
We could get some midget AAA players to outperform some of our wingers though.
God dammit. Thanks for the correction!
did his ancestor fuck up with a birth certificate or
"Morgan Rielly is the best M.Rielly in the league I totally agree!

Mike Reilly is the best M.Reilly in the league though so you guys are doing pretty well too!"
But not in Canada. That obviously goes to M.Reilly of the Eskimos.
Me too! He has the skill and the size to be good. Just needs a chance. He was averaging less than 15 minute TOI with Minny and now he's close to 20 minutes TOI in the 4 games with us. Big difference
"Same thing that happened with Girardi, plays like shit on the top pairing, sees a marked improvement when moved to the bottom 4 where they belong."
He was solid in NY too. Just became a scapegoat after a poor start with the team. 
I think the hate stems from his time in Colorado
"The Rangers could conceivably re-sign all their RFA's (Skjei, Nemestnikov, Vesey, Spooner, Hayes) but I kind of think one of them gets flipped at the draft. So I'm not sure exactly who it'll be. I'm sure Spooner's extension will heavily be based on whether the FO thinks Spooner is a center or winger going forward.  "
This isn’t grading the trades it’s grading the players
"So you guys should be mad at your coach, not Holden."
Sweeney did an excellent job. Rick Nash is such a significant upgrade and we gave up completely expendable assets to get him
To be fair the Stafford trade last year was decent
Hasn’t taken me long at all to fall in love with Rick Nash. I hope we can keep him but I gotta feeling the price will be too high
"Everyone laughed when we signed him but he’s been effective for us. Having a guy like him to plug in the bottom 6 when an injury hits could be huge in the playoffs. Small sample size but I love the signing. Plus, it never hurts to have a “win it for this guy” veteran on the team for the playoffs "
Not till Saturday at the earliest was the last news I heard. 
"""Hiiiii everybody!!"""
"He’s like a Arvi, Watson, Smith hybrid and it’s amazing. Much like the way the Subban trade pivoted our blue-line to its two-way powerhouse, Hartman has turned our 4th from a checking shut-down line to a line that’ll kick your ass and then score on you while they do it it’s been amazing to watch"
"Honestly I think we paid as much as we did because Poile that he was exactly the kind of player that would thrive in our system, so he was gonna pay whatever the price was"
"I understand the idea behind deadline acquisitions is they come in with a short amount of time, but given our situation and Plek's reputation, I'm nowhere near calling this a bad trade yet"
"yep, totally. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fymAJLuz4hA"
"Bob did not see Wagner as part of the Ducks future next year. So I guess, might as well give Chimera a shot. If Chimera shows a sign of his former self, it's a win for Bob.I liked Wagner a lot too, but objectively speaking he wasn't that great. I doubt Chimera is back next year anyways. 

Shaw for JT Brown has worked out well. 

Chris Kelly was really weird, but Ducks have nothing to lose. 

"
Exactly
"Shouldn’t have made him shave, I guess."
He hasn't been productive for 2 years. Thanks for taking him.
Reached his career high in points last night. After missing so many games. Vats is unreal.
"He had a high ankle sprain.

> Frank Vatrano, traded to Florida from Boston for a third-round pick on Feb. 22, has not made his Panthers debut due to a high-ankle sprain. Boughner said Vatrano was scheduled to practice with the team Monday morning for the first time, but the team canceled practice after Sunday’s 4-1 win over Philadelphia.

> In the 10 days since the trade, Vatrano has skated before practice, and wore a non-contact jersey during morning skate on Thursday.

> “Both these guys, I think, are probably a week away at least,” Boughner said. “But they’re progressing.”

http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/florida-panthers/panthers-blog/fl-sp-panthers-frank-vatrano-denis-malgin-20180304-story.html"
Bruins Legends Rick Nash and Brian Gionta
I totally agree.
"If any of the players we picked up are going to stay, it'll be Cole. With Jack leaving and Cole proving himself, it should be a no brainer. Thanks!"
"I tend to agree with a B if you set your expectations correctly. He's been serviceable for a 6-7 D, but his pairing has struggled. I think he's been better than Hunwick and Ruh, but clearly not a top 4 guy.  Offensively he struggles to hit the net and contribute. "
I put a lot of the blame for his issues with being paired with Hunwick but the fact is his pairing has struggled. His shot is great but rarely hits the net and he doesn't position himself well for 1timers.
"I’m willing to give Sheahan some leeway right now, had what? 24 points in around 44 points as the 3C? That may be wrong but I think it was around that ballpark. At that point Sheahan proved himself a good bottom 6 center, he took a while to get into a groove and with the pace of the Pens game, but then again so did Kessel, and Brassard probably will too, I think right now we should give Sheahan some time to mesh with Kuhnackal and Simon/Whoever else plays on the 4RW. "
I'm honesty just glad Armstrong had the guts to realize the situation and make the appropriate move. The funny thing is on HF boards Blues and Jets fans agreed to a very similar trade very very quickly literally the day before the trade deadline. 1st and good prospect for Stastny. It might literally be the most successful HFboard trade thread of all time.
I'm not at all salty about not getting Brassard now. Stastny just fits with us so much better.
[deleted]
"Especially when Enström went down in practice that morning,"
They won't sign him. Poolman will come up after Enstrom is gone. This is strictly rental for the playoffs.
Why can't he expect a C and still call him a C? 
And he's even chipped in a couple of points.
"no it was bruins, didn't get a point against the wild on sunday^^/s"
"I laughed, and then I was sad.  


Meanie. "
"Exactly. If the most noteable thing a 3rd liner does is a good stretch on a PK then they’re doing what you want them to. No major fuck ups, get shots at the net. "
"Motte is turning out to be a really good shutdown/minutes eater.

He won't win you a game, but he'll keep you in one."
"I would give an average shut down player a C. He's nothing special, but reliable. That's probably his ceiling as well...imo that's not worth so much for a rebuilding team. but i can respect that other people value that more than me"
You’re goddamn right we do. 
"Him staying in the lineup means Goodrow sits, and that's a bummer since he's been doing well (going by my eye test, so the stats may tell another story) on the fourth line with Karlsson grinding it out in the offensive zone."
People bring it up about P Kane all the time though.
"Yeah do you not remember how P Kane got roasted for his off-season stuff?

Evander deserves criticism when he’s a douche bag "
Seguin has been pretty good since his move to Dallas...
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cafj9ulW8AEIdKz.jpg
"hope for the best....he is talented......will be enjoying the play offs .....especially if the Sharks play the Jets ......big fan of the Sharks . Burns is a local Barrie On boy

Bigger fan of the Jets tho"
"If it makes you feel any better, the one on the Leafs is Rielly.

It's probably where your brain was drawing from."
"He needs the ice time to develop, but he was fighting with Brodin, Suter, Olofsson, Seeler, and Soucy for NHL time in MIN(slotting into 5th only in front of Soucy).  Glad he is doing well with MTL."
"This is true, New York wasn’t playing him in the correct spot."
"Ya he has 3 points  in 3 games for Boston, and a +2 rating, he’s doing fine"
Dear god I hope they see him as a winger.  He generally struggles as a centre.  His best games are consistently on the wing
"Oh, we are. Most of us can’t wait for him to be let go of in the off-season."
"Holden had some bad moments in big games but you're right, plenty of the hate could be attributed to AV's poor roster decisions. "
Oh trust me- we are mad at him. AV needs to go ASAP.
"I think it's more on management. We've yet to have a top pair RHD since Girardi declined years ago. The closest we've done is Shattenkirk, who has spent his entire career sheltered on the second pair. Any decision that AV made for the top pair RHD slot was going to be bad."
He's their Kevan Miller.  Great player when he's playing where he should in the lineup
"Yea, but for some that’s to much logic"
Hard not to fall in love with Nash. He does it all and he does it all well
"Aw too bad. It would have been cool if his first game back was against us, but there is no reason to rush him."
Hi Dr. Nick!
Once we ice a healthy lineup again it's going to be so ultimate
I just don't know why we would make these moves when we have younger kids that can potentially fill the roles next year.
Plekanec as Samson and Lou Lamoriello as Delilah makes perfect sense to me.
He’ll likely come back to you guys this summer anyway 
"What am I missing here?

He has 28 points this year and his career high is 38."
One of 3 guys to actually be consistently useful recently. His career high is 38 and he only has 28
Vats has a high ceiling and has improved his defensive game.  His only problem at times is that his smaller frame gets pushed around a bit in the D zone and can make bad passes in front of the net.  I'm glad he's doing so well with you guys!  We love Rico here :)  Just scored his 20th last night!
"> I put a lot of the blame for his issues with being paired with Hunwick

And his ridiculous decision making...I keep seeing him behind the net and someone actually useful taking his spot covering for him.

I appreciate the effort but c'mon."
Maybe when ZAR is healthy he cane get some better linemates
"What? Have you looked at a pick value chart? There’s a high chance you aren’t getting an NHL player out of a late 1st... 4th to 7th probabilities are all tiny. Giving up a 4th instead of a 6th is basically statistical noise in whether you’re getting a guy who makes the NHL.

And if we’re talking impact players, they’re actually the exact same percentage, so you were wrong there too.

"I mean why wouldn't they? If his new contract is less than 1,025,000 then Chevy can bury him in the AHL with 100% cap relief."
"I've noticed he's pretty bad offensively (whiffs on shots, misplaces passes), but that's what we were expecting anyways. However, one plus is that he is really good at gaining the zone based off an eye test at least"
Well that's nice to read.
I mean someone has to do the job? He’s young and cheap and playing well. what more do you want lol. 
"Yeah he got roasted one offseason for potentially raping a girl and E Kane gets shit on non-stop for taking a picture with money on his back for his insta. No one calls shits on Zach Kassian, or Ryan O Rielly for their shit either."
I would love to see Kane in the playoffs against the Jets too. Would be fun.
Oh for sure. I have him in fantasy too. 
"With Weber and Mete out for the season, there's plenty of ice time available."
"The only problem with Holden is that when he's on he's pretty under the radar, and when he's off it's really glaring. He's solid 90% of the time but that 10% of fuck up is prime fuck up. "
"He's good offensively and actually put up some good numbers with us. He seemed really good at first when he was with us, but a little more time with him revealed the cracks in his game. Give it some time and you'll start seeing him make defensive gaffes that will leave you scratching your head and/or ripping your hair out. As long as you keep him sheltered (Which we didn't) he'll be serviceable."
"With Howden, Andersson, Chytil all in the pipeline the Rangers have much more of a need at wing - especially with Miller/Nash/Grabner and potentially Zuccarello leaving. I hope he's seen as a winger too. "
"Given the fact that he's remained on the wing while they moved Desharnais to center the top line while Zibanejad was out last night tells me that they want to keep him there.  That said, AV will likely be gone and there's no telling who comes in and what system will ultimately be brought.  

I agree with silverswimmer here too.  The Rangers will have Hayes/Mika/Vlad signed for next year at least at center and the three kids are most valuable as centers.  It doesn't make any sense to have Spooner as the center on a 4th line, so if he stays, my guess is that it's at wing unless there's a mess of injuries."
Yeah I haven't liked the guy since the 2011 SCF.
We miss you AV
And he’s gonna Johnny boychuk for us. Perfect. 
"Kelly, Brown, and Chimera all have expiring contracts. Brown is the only one Ducks might keep. 

And yeah, I think Kossila, Roy, and/or Kerdillas have make or break years next season. "
"I really hope so. I think you guys will be pleasantly surprised with him in the playoffs, as he has a knack for shadowing and shutting down elite players in the post-season. It might take him some time to get used to your system, but I think he will be a great addition for you. 

And hopefully he's still willing to return to Montreal afterwards. "
"Yea it’s unfortunate, but we aren’t exactly a powerhouse right now. Our third line is kind of expected to be pretty unimpressive skill wise. "
"Yeah he does a job that s fairly easily replaced, and it's a plus that he's young and cheap but that's why it's a C grade. If I didn't like the trade it would be a failing grade. I just meant, it was an ok trade but that's about it"
Evander has done more than flash cash around....
are you tuning into the flames vs sabres?
I like Brown. I enjoy his streams lol.
34 being out puts him higher up in the lineup than intended.  A line of komarov-Plek-kapanen should be great and what happens if were healthy.  
What else has he done? Genuinely would like to know.
"Banned from a chain of restaurants for being abusive and repeatedly walking out on his bills.
Homophobic tweet.
Charged with assault and then dropped but victim sued.
Skipping practices.
Failure to follow team policies.

I worked at a company where if he called in, it was to immediately be forwarded to C level personnel due to his abusive behavior. His account was documented a mile long but I can't say where this was of course, so take that with a grain or two. "
"October 2011: Evander has his ""business manager"" attempt to shake down smaller businesses for the privilege of him making positive tweets for them 

January 2012: Evander fights with coach Noel, and is benched because Kane was phoning in the game, this issue would pop up time and again 

January 2012: Evander is accused of walking out of bills of several restaurants with the alleged quote of, ""they should be paying ME to be here"" this rumour surfaces over and over again 

February 2012: The Jets ask now 20 year old Evander to stop fighting with people / posting controversial things on twitter and social media, this is part of the ""money flashing"" issue and later the ""money push up"" issue, but there is much more 

February 2012: Evander misses time with a concussion although it was never seen how it was sustained in practise or in a game, he says he got it and played through it (which is bad) but the rumor is he got it by fighting with bouncers at a local bar after getting heated with some female patrons (would be even worse) 

June 2013: Kane gets into trouble by insinuating Chris Bosh is gay in a infamous tweet he was forced to delete and apology for.... “Chris Bosh looked like a fairy going to the rim.”

April 2014: Kane is accused of assault in Vancouver and is sued for damages 

April 2014: Kane is benched by now new coach Paul Maurice and says if he wants to actually play all he has to do is ""probably just come to the rink.”

February 2015: Kane burns his last bridge in Winnipeg by showing up to a team meeting without a suit, a violation of team policy and apparently a lack of respect issue as teammate Dustin Buff allegedly tosses his track suit in the shower to send him a message 

June 2016: Evander Kane is charged with four counts of non-criminal harassment and one count of misdemeanour trespass after he allegedly grabbed two women at a bar and then refused to leave 

I'm sure I missed some more of this saint's actions! "
Damn. Well I hope our leadership set him straight and I hope he sticks to it. I guess we’ll find out
Yeah but that's not *real* communism.
"Wow, that’s an impressive list! Thanks for putting that together! Definitely not betting on him suddenly changing his ways, but I can still have hope!"
"I hope he's grown up. Guy has natural talent. I was hoping he would grow up in Winnipeg but it's not where his heart was.

Looks like he's changing his tune so I hope the best for him and your Sharks!"

Don't worry Will. You're not the first Flower victim at practice."
"This is the type of shit I wish the Rangers would do! Their social media is so boring, it’s like a robot runs it... do love me some Amanda Borges though 😍"
Second Karlsson clip I've seen in as many days. Are they hyping up Big Willy to be the face of the franchise? Or is that still MAF?
Damnit and we traded him for Wisniewski 
Miss this man so much :(
Karlsson reminds me of Tim Riggins from FNL so much.
I'm irrationally angry they didn't actually do a slo-mo on the hair flip.
How the hell did he go from 9 goals two seasons ago and 6 goals last season to 35 so far this season. Thats awesome. 
I love my mom too you sweet handsome prince.

Solid salad.
"Player|TOI|Sv%|HDSA|HDSA/60|HD SV%|5v5 sv%
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
Holtby|2708.93|.907|344|7.6|.756|.917
Grubauer|1268.67|.923|181|8.6|.834|.944

Grubauer has faced the *most* high danger shots against/60 of any goalie with TOI>800

Among Goalies with TOI >800 (56 goalies), Holtby ranks *51st* in HDsv%. Grubauer ranks the *5th*.

Among Goalies with TOI >800 at 5v5 (53 Goalies), Holtby ranks *39th* in 5v5 Sv%. Grubauer ranks *2nd*.

Hotlby is having a rough year, and needs to get his groove back - in the mean time, no reason not to play a kid who's been having a fantastic season behind the same defense and facing the same sort of pressure."
"It's weird because before last years playoffs he was imo easily the best and most dominant playoff goalie in the NHL, and one of the best in the regular season.

Does anyone have a clue why he is struggling so much? Could it be because he played too much or has had too much pressure on him? I'm just thinking because he seems to be an even bigger competitor than most and if the team isn't able to get it done it must be exhausting mentally."
"Grubauer’s stats are among the best in the league this year, but he won’t get more starts because Trotz’s doesn’t seem to like doing smart things"
[Holtby's reaction](https://media.giphy.com/media/1zh6fiS73VqVZ7N1P9/giphy.gif)
Would really like to see Grubauer take the reigns and run with it. This is his greatest opportunity.
Give Grubi a chance. I look forward to seeing what he can do against the top dogs.
I'm glad we aren't the only ones with goaltending issues. Please come back Muzz
"yeah, goalie struggles!"
Dammit Kuch
I guess his “lucky bounces” have run out. 
"Listen, I love Holts and Gruby and AGREE that Holts is having an off year(D isn't helping,  but hes still playing awful).  But Gruby is shielded, he is typically playing lower quality teams.  I DO think we should ride Gruby, but not expect miracles. "
"He struggled in the playoffs last year for some reason.  Add to it that Korn (ex goalie coach) moved on to a more front office position and less hands on with Holtby this year might be a small factor as well.  He is just off, like way off."
"I think the nerves and pressure got to him. Going into last years' playoffs, he had tied the record for the most wins in a season by a goaltender. That's a tremendous personal accolade, now he had to live up to it in the playoffs as well as stand tall during one of the team's last great years before their Cup window closes. In the first round they played the Leafs who were essentially a kryptonite for Holtby. The Caps maintained possession and control of most games, but the Leafs would get chances on counter-attacks which Holtby is not good at handling (he's better when he's facing more shots, not random 2-on-1's here and there). Although the Caps win, I think that series shook him as he really wanted to rebound after that heartbreaking Caps/Rangers series the year before. Moving into the Pens series, the same thing happened but even worse. The Caps played the Pens better than any other team that postseason, in my opinion. But Holtby gave up numerous critical goals which prevented the Caps from moving on. After that rough failure, this season he's looked very different."
"Next game in Trotz's mind: 
Start Holtby, scratch Vrana, 1st line DSP.

....anything I'm missing? "
And that's with a terrible start where he didn't win his first game until Thanksgiving. Holts just doesn't have it this year and I hope Trotz figured it out before the playoffs 
Lucky bounces? Capitals? I don't understand.
"At the end of the night Grubauer is stopping pucks and Holtby isn't. Even when you adjust for the different situations they're facing, Holtby has been straight up bad. His numbers are bad, he looks bad, and his demeanor is bad. "
">But Gruby is shielded, he is typically playing lower quality teams.

... And is facing a higher rate of high danger shots.

Saying those teams are worse doesn't change that an extra high danger shot/game is a BIG difference."
High danger shots are high danger shots. Doesn’t matter what team they come from
"> Add to it that Korn (ex goalie coach) moved on to a more front office position and less hands on with Holtby this year **might be a small factor** as well.

It's a huge factor.

Rinne had a significant dip after Korn left Nashville, even though both had been working for years with Ben Vanderklok. Scott Murray had comparatively little time with Holtby in Washington, and is a far less experienced (and IMO far less capable) coach than Vanderklok.

Goalie coaches are like boxing trainers and tennis coaches: the professional relationship is extremely close, and changing it is is challenging at best."
You forgot the part where he scratches our deadline acquisitions to keep Brooks Orpik in the lineup
"“We earned our bounces, they just kinda got theirs” - Braden Holtby 

RE: 2017 Captials playoff series against Leafs

I don’t have any respect for someone who credits the opposing teams success to lucky bounces. "
"When you say high danger, you're saying where players are in relation to the net, meaning close to the net?

Because a more skilled team with more skilled forwards is going to make better shots from higher danger locations.  The danger might technically be the same, but the skill behind the shots is not.  I think that's what he's referring to."
"That's just not true, a high danger shot from someone like kuch or Crosby or any other talented finisher can be considered more dangerous than some 4th liner.  Just sayin"
I was joking about the Caps being usually snakebitten in the playoffs. 
"He said that after the Mathews stantion goal... cause you know when you dump the puck in and bounces right to the guy infront of the net.. its kinda luck... how about the knon of maf stick save in the series after.  
Maybe watch the games kid. 'Respect'"
leafs did get a lot of lucky goals that series 
"While the finishers you noted would be more likely to generate more high danger shots. A “high danger shot” is defined by specific metrics, not by the specific shooter. So when it says he has a better high danger sv%, it’s normalizing for all of the different shooters and breaking the shot up by quality, not by team or shooter. Make more sense?"
"Except he wasn’t talking about one play. He was referencing the whole series. 

>Maybe watch the games kid. 

LMAO. That’s pretty much the poster child statement for insecurity. At least put a little effort into trying to insult someone. "
"Wait aren't HD shots just determined by where on the ice they are shot from?
https://imgur.com/1fzcaQT

Kadri and Laine (two random examples) might get the same opportunity from the left hashmark, but Laine is much more likely to put that puck in the net. If that is the case, QoC definitely does factor in; likely doesn't account for the entire difference but it isn't negligible. "

Or smaller schools that can’t compete with schools like Wayzata who has more that 1100 students in a GRADE. Most schools in A don’t have that much in their whole school.
"Mn Class A is better than the highest division HS hockey in at least 45 other states, and its all like 500 student schools. How can someone not love small-school puck that spicy?"

Ok haha my bad. I won’t tell you my second choice was Hill-Murray then. Who should I pull for in AA? 
"Yeah, this year especially I think the favorites are far and away the best teams. If the top AA seeds win on Thursday it'll be an unbelievable Friday session. I'd love to see East go to the final but I don't think it'll happen. "
"Ahh, ducksworth would have been too perfect"
"Oh look, we just *happened* to draw a rematch of the title game last year. How fortunate."
"No East is the definition of cake eaters, just slightly less resplendent northern ones.  Their cakes are not made with the artisan imported French flour, but instead just come from whole foods ingredients."

"Hell yeah, is this just current game is or is it streaming all tournament?"
"Exactly. Our HS has ~500 kids total. And it's by no means the smallest school with a hockey program, either! "
I think learning that not everyone gets to be a winner is an important lesson.  And the schools that do win in A generally have strong hockey programs and/or are wealthy areas where they should really be AA anyway.
"Its not all 500 person schools, and some of the 500 person schools import a lot of players and actually have strong programs and don't belong there."
"I do go every year, and it is fine hockey, but sad that it is almost always dominated by teams that should be A, but value winning over playing at the correct level."

Winning only means something if you have a fair playing field.
"* Well, the [crowd it draws](https://imgur.com/GdsZXhN), for one. It's always a sellout for the AA championship, which results in an incredible atmosphere. They sell out the same arena that the Wild play in, it's pretty impressive. The single A tournament (smaller schools) doesn't draw quite as well, but it's still fun. 

* The skill level is pretty incredible for high schoolers, too. The semifinal and championship games are almost always fast and good hockey games, at both the A and AA levels. Lots of D1 recruits and some future NHLers play in this tournament!

* The Xcel Center itself is an awesome hockey venue. Not a bad seat in the house, good food (although maybe a tad pricey?)

* There's also the big ""Let's Play Hockey"" expo right next door on Friday and Saturday, tons of hockey vendors and companies and such that have cool things to see and try and buy.

**Fellow MN State-Tourney enthusiasts, chime in! Let's convince u/pyro5050 to come on down!!**"
"> why is it that good?

I have no Mn bias. I'm a proud product of America's *other* hockey power state (suck start the UP, Michigan).

Mn's HS tournament is absolutely the best minor hockey tourney in America. It's probably the best in *North* America. The talent level is outstanding, the format is excellent, and the atmosphere is unreal. Getting in the barn for the semis was as hard as hell, kind of expensive, and 1000% worth it. Mass Super 8 is an awesome minor tourney, and is a fucking joke compared to Mn. 

Tickets are sold in sessions, so you get a few games for your ticket. Be ready to drink beer and learn all about why Hermantown and Duluth hate the MSP schools, and why everyone on the fucking planet hates Edina (I was kind of pulling for Edina due to the hate. Probably a Boston thing)"
"I would add since it hasnt been mentioned enough, the atmosphere is absolutely fucking electric. This is these kids Stanley Cup growing up, each end of the arena is a solid wall of students. Its a legit reason to be excused from school to go to the games. We all do the cheers and it's just insane. My school won my senior year and I was on the glass where the team celebrated the game winner. Only time in my life I've ever yelled myself hoarse. I can't even fully explain how great the crowd was. You feel it in your marrow.  I've been to several championships before and since and it's crazy every time."
">...only outdoor youth programs in the country

There *are* other outdoor youth programs in the state, but yeah."
"Ah you bastards over at Glen Avon, Congdon, Lower Chester, Lester Park, and Woodland.

Cake eaters the lot of you.  Over on the west side we had to walk uphill to our outdoor hockey both ways and didn't even have our daddies take us to the steakhouse after the games.  Instead we just got smacked!"
they'll lose though lol
"Life isn't a fair playing field.  Nothing is ever a fair playing field.  Even in my men's league where there are evaluations and 8 divisions, there are better and worse teams in each divisions because some teams have better players at that level, and some worse.

Grow up."
"There have been a ton of great NHL players who have torn it up there.

Phil Housley  
Neal Broten  
Matt Cullen  
David Backes  
TJ Oshie  
Nick Leddy  
Tom Kurvers  
Mark Parrish  
Trent Klatt  
Ryan McDonagh  

Maybe one or two of those guys didn't even make the tournament because their teams lost in the sectional tournaments (Backes?).

I am sure I left off a few.  Each year there are a dozen or more future D1 players and probably 1 or 2 future NHL players.  And the atmosphere is dope.  Super talented 16 year olds doing the anthem, the pep bands are fun, and the place is packed with hockey fans."
That sounds dull. I'd rather watch my Ottawa Senators defend a 1 goal deficit then see some end to end rushes where the defense is suspect.
The rivalries are the best. Every school up north hates the city schools. Us vs. Them mentality.
"> why everyone on the fucking planet hates Edina (I was kind of pulling for Edina due to the hate. Probably a Boston thing)

an Edina sweater would be nice to have, Warroad is my favorite though"
Fuck Edina
Other hockey state? I'd argue that Wisconsin might deserve some placement in there. Specifically because they carry womens hockey.
I can't think of any programs outside of Duluth that don't have an indoor rink?
A and AA are divisions just like your dumb beer league.
Why doesn’t Crown college in St Bonifacilus MN play Ohio State in football? Honestly what losers life isn’t fair. 
">grow up

LOL this guy. 

"
I get that but sports are you dense fuck
You got downvoted but that was hilarious. 
"And they all also hate Duluth East.  Fucking Cake Eaters!  But sometimes we can put that aside to cheer for a northern team in the tourney, though we have to hold our noses."
"I thought the Warriors would get back to The Tourney for the first time a while this year, but no dice! "
Nah WI is behind MI and probably MA as well.  Maybe WI can fight it out with NH or something.
"Serious question, why doesn't Duluth minor hockey have access to any indoor rinks? You'd think a city that size would have several, and there's also the UMD facility."
"Well except they don't really do a good job of separating the good teams from the bad ones.  And the beer league does it out of a sense of fun, not in some misguided effort to maintain ""fairness"".

If Roseau can play with the big boys so can anyone."
"The point is that there are like 100+ teams.  Having two divisions is not really ""more fair"".  You have teams like Hermantown which is IDK 15th in the state beating up the 60th best team.  How is that fair?

Then the winner of the ~8 teams 10-40 who best hid that they are solid hockey programs get to be ""second champion""."
"It's been a while but Edina, not Duluth East were the cake eaters when I played in AA. "
"The list of NHL players coming from UW vs Mich/State is much higher. The amount of players currently in the NHL may be higher for MI, but the impact that WI players make is much larger (including 2 Stanley Cups). This isn't even bringing in Womens hockey, which WI completely destroys everybody in.

With MA vs WI, again the impact of WI born players is much higher than that of MA. This one looks like it's subject to change because the young talent from MA does look better. The players making an impact in the NHL from UW vs BC/BU leans a bit towards the MA side. Having 2 colleges will help that, but specifically comparing UW vs BU, BU is still just barely a step ahead (something I think would be changed had it not been for Geoffrions injury. However MA, is still the only state that can compare in Womens hockey, but still doesn't quite cut it.

All of this is found by simply googling."
Just not how that works... how come Gustavus doesn’t compete with Michigan? The size and athletic departments play directly into success and a team like Litchfield doesn’t have the same people or AD resources that Minnetonka or Wayzata have. Obviously small hockey crazy towns and private schools are exceptions but overall yeah that isn’t how athletics work.
"I actually think there needs to be a AAA so AA can be the Orono, Brecks and Hermantowns and A can be the tiny schools. Suggesting everyone should play together is ridiculous "
Edina will forever be the Cake Eaters thanks to Mighty Ducks.
"You must have lived south of Hinckley then.  But yeah Edina is the Cake Eaters^2  But honestly that is like half of the outer suburbs, Edina just has a good hockey program."
"Minnesota Active 48, Total 261, Stars:  Parise, Wheeler, Boeser, Stepan, Okposo, Backes, Byfulien, Cullen, McDonaugh  
Michigan Active 36, Total 168, Stars:  Kesler, Miller, Larkin  
Massachusetts Active 23, Total 196, Stars:  Eichel, Yandel  
Wisconsin Active 13, Total 37, Stars:  Kessel, Pavelski, Suter  

WI does have some real weight on the top level talent side recently, but other than that, not much.
"
"> The list of NHL players coming from UW vs Mich/State is much higher.

How many of those players were of MN origins, though? McDonaugh, for example."
I would be fine with some sort of promotion and relegation system.  But setting up a second division for the scaredy schools to dominate is just stupid.
"Edina is on another level of cake eater with its pretentiousness.

Though most of the suburbs in the immediate vicinity of Lake Minnetonka and from 169 west to the the Hennepin County line, south to Lake Waconia, then southeast to the Minnesota River are the old money upper crust or ""it's family money"" suburbs, Edina was just the first, due to its proximity to the Minneapolis Lakes neighborhoods south of Uptown. There's more like it outside that area, too, but in my experience, that particular area has the highest *concentration* of that type of person."
"MN was never in argument, because everybody knows that they are pretty much Canada.

The top 5 players from WI out produce every single player in the NHL from Michigan.

The top 5 players from WI outproduce the top 10 from MA.

EDIT: I'll wait until you want to start bringing in Womens hockey also...."
"That's why the list of WI born players is also there. I'm talking about what the state produces as hockey. I listed both for early development and late development.

How many WI born players has MN/ND taken? Kessel for example."
I would love a promotion/relegation system so I am with you there.
"I am just sick fo 25 years of watching the Hermantowns, and Warroads, and Saint Thomas's of the world call themselves winners.

All top half programs who stayed down because they would rather be winners than compete with peers, and the Class A tournament is frequently dominated y those teams, which is why I don't like it.  I guess it is just a different aspect of fairness."
"I get that 100%. I was just thinking more for the rest of A(Not the Roseaus, Oronos, Brecks etc) that would win a game or two a year if made to play everyone else. I think the relegation promotion would fix this though not having everyone play together."
"God...can you imagine how *awesome* an upset would feel for the lower seeded team?

YOU PICKED US, AND WE STILL WHIPPED YOUR ASS!

I do have to wonder though...how many times it would wind up ""1 picks $lowestpoints, 2 picks $nextlowestpoints"" and so on...shaking out exactly the way a ""seed the top N"" would *anyway*.

"
Yes!  This is the shit
"I wish the nhl would do this. 
There’s so much more competitiveness AND it’s another event they can sell, like trade deadline day, draft day, free agent “frenzy” etc."
"I want this for hype purposes alone. 

You think draft lottery day and draft day and trade deadline day are hyped up?

Just you wait. This would be so hyped up if the NHL did it. "
I love this just because of the animosity it would create in matchups. The lower seed would come in with a massive chip on their shoulder and the higher seed would have everything to lose and then some. I honestly believe that it would create more entertaining hockey.
"Our (austrian) hockey league established such picking-system some years ago. To be honest: This change was nothing but great so far! 

1) The end of the regular season (or the ""pick round"") has become much more interesting, there are no meaningless games anymore.

2) The pick itself is broadcasted on TV and provides ""whoa, why are they choosing *this* team?"" moments on a regular basis. ;-)

3) There had been some major upsets for teams picking a certain opponent. Every playoff-loss becomes more emotional because it was ""your"" opponent you lost against. Also works in combination with 2), which is even more devastating. (""See?! I said so!!"")

I would love to see such system in the NHL."
Badass
"Yeah, this was announced 4 months ago."
The ultimate bulletin board material.
Genius.
Great Share.

"I think that’s what Gully was saying in his quote, but with more and more input from analytical departments, it’s foolish not to look for the best “matchup”.  
Is the NHL still conservative enough to ignore this format if it really catches on in the minor leagues ?"
"I don't think the ""top seed picks lowest points...and so on"" would happen that often actually.  I would think how a team matches up against other teams would hold a higher value (so, W/L against for that season).  Also, if a team just lost a 1C or 1D before the playoffs, they may think they were vulnerable in the first round.  If you had first crack at 5-8, and you had a team that you smacked around in the regular season and a different team that just lost their 1C or their 1G for the rest of the season...what do you do there?  Might be pretty neat, actually."
"I imagine they'd want to pick the highest team they think they can defeat. Make it easier in the later rounds, take the hard hockey up front."
"Imagine the bedlam if the #1 team picked the #3 team right off the bat just to send a message. 

Meanwhile, the #5 team, who thought they were slated to get picked by the #4 team, now gets a pick themselves."
"If Toronto was the top seed in the East and Buffalo was the #2 WC, there is no way we pick them first.

(Silly example just to illustrate a point...)

There are definitely matchups you want to avoid even though the points may indicate otherwise."
"It would be most likely to end up the way it plays out currently, but if one of the higher-ranked teams had a bad second half, or is an easier opponent for the "
"I wonder if you could even argue that you'd garner more fan attention to the playoff race from fanbases of the top teams?

Maybe, for example, TB fans might feel pretty solid about their playoff position this year with 8-10 games remaining...but might develop new interest in the race for the final spot, feeling like the Lightning ""have _______'s number, so I hope they get in"".

"
Which league is that
"> with more and more input from analytical departments, it’s foolish not to look for the best “matchup”.

Ya know, that makes for the possibility of a *really* interesting ""test"" of analytics...or at least an interesting way for teams to evaluate the strength of their analytics. 

Let's start by saying you're right, and that teams would use analytics to select favorable matchups.  

So, seed teams as before...say 1-8 based on points, or whatever.  Ok, in the ""old system"" #1 would have played #8.  Now, #1 chooses, say, #6 based on analytics suggesting that's their best matchup.

Historically, how do #1 seeds do against #8s (or whoever they'd have been arbitrarily paired against), compared to how these choosing teams do against their selections?

In theory, if their analytics were right, and they chose the ""best matchups"" in every case, then they should have better luck against their selections than the ""arbitrary"" matchups would have provided, right?

Put another way, if you're going to choose to play a higher ranked team than you could have, you'd better have a good reason. :)

Would take several seasons for enough sample size, but I bet it'd generate a whole new field of ""analytics analytics"" that'd be damned interesting to examine."
"Minor hockey here though is the SPHL

I'm not sure how much of a cue the NHL is taking from that league. 

I mean if we see it trialed in the AHL first, then the NHL can consider it, but its gotta a long way to work its way up. 

SPHL is so minor of a league. "
yeah... but i still wouldnt take on pittsburg
Ironic that this is the main complaint of the playoff seeding now
"that cant happen.... third paragraph in the article 

>The Southern Professional Hockey League will use a “pick your opponent” playoff format, with the first-place team choosing its first-round opponent from the teams that finished from fifth to eighth place, then the second- and third-place teams makes their choices before the final two teams get matched up. In the second round, teams will be matched by regular-season points.

edit: wrong comment to reply to... sorry "
"Oh man, hadn't even considered what might happen if a ""picking team"" got picked themselves.

Exactly! It adds another level of interest to the last month of the season:)
"The official name is ""Erste Bank Eishockey Liga"" (EBEL). It's a multi-national league with teams from Austria, Italy, Hungary, Croatia and the Czech Republic. (Only 12 teams though)"
"Right? 
How could this NOT be a great new playoff format?"
Isn’t Scott Darling literally the only guy to ever make the NHL from the SPHL? 
"Hey, I just think it’s a good idea. Who cares where it came from?"

He scored those first two goals again beating tender without screen ect. He keeps those goalies looking like 80's still.
Not bad for a third liner.
Generational talent. Almost as many goals as Crosby as a teenager.

I'm guessing he's playing good when I can see like 7 posts about Laine on the hockey subreddit.
I swear that beard has super powers!
Wow! He already has 38 hat tricks?
Crazy how this guy had a terrible scoreless stretch and is now on his way to being the goal leader for the season.
Am I mistaken or wasn’t everyone worried that Laine lost his scoring touch at the beginning of this season?  Kids an animal
I like Laine but I hope the Rocket Richard race ends up being the battle of 2 Russians.  Looks like that may not be the case!
"Patrick, buddy,,, the beards gotta geaux"
"Yeap, this is going to be great day"
Lmao I had the exact same reaction. It got better and better haha
Gretzky’s 50 in 39 included at least one empty netter.
Counts on the score sheet!
Nah. He’s a stud. Even the empty netter was slick. 
"Michael Grabner had like 20 EN goals and we traded him for a second rounder and a prospect! you could probably get at least a first rounder for Laine!

teams always trade away their leading goal scorer at the deadline, right?"
A goal is a goal!
For an empty netter it's a nice goal though. Not everyone has the balls and the release to shoot from it all the way out there and right out the faceoff.
He got one in AZ as I was leaving the stadium sad I didn’t get to see a Laine goal. But as far as I know those are the only 2. 
A goal is a goal
If anybody knows a hatty because the last goal was an empty netter they are an idiot. Props to Laine kid has been dynamite this year. 
"lmao, remember that ""laine only scores empty netters"" circle jerk last year."
"As empty netters go, that was a nice one."
"So, since he joined the NHL. That's insane."
Anders Lee at #8 kind of blows my mind.
"Furthermore, his shooting has been 18,7% during that time (=his whole NHL-career). Some ""experts"" claimed last season that it's unsustainable level.

Laine is a damn good player, a franchise player for any team, but he’s not generational. A generational player only occurs once per generation of players, as the name suggests (Crosby, McDavid). If Laine is a generational talent then what about Eichel, Matthews?



That’s my take on it, but it’s just an opinion.


Edit: it really is interesting to see other people’s opinions on this but a lot of the comments are just like “no ur wrong laine is so good”. I’d like to see a bit of discussion about what you guys think. "
"3 goals in a row, no one from either team scoring in between."

"At this pace, he may end up on top of that list."
Crosby also played 160 games as a teenager. Laine just played game 139. 
And 2 behind Gretzky!
I wish he wasnt out because of the concussion last year..
One behind still?
"I think it's fair to call him a ""generational"" goal scorer, not player. He is the best goal scorer to enter the league since Ovechkin, so more than 10 years."
I guess we'll see a generation from now who is talked about more - Laine or his draft year contemporaries. 
"Hard to compare those stats anyway, didnt like 10 players have over 100p seasons when Crosby was rookie? "
"Goals matter more. They are simply worth quite a bit more. And Laine is the best ever in that. 

You're looking at ""The one"""
"I don't disagree with you. I think generational gets thrown around way too often these days. 

Laine may not be a generational player but he's setting himself up to become an elite, generational scorer in some pretty exclusive company. "
He's the best shooter ever. Ever.
"Gotta love r/hockey. Downvoted by the masses because you don't think Laine is generational. He's a great goal scorer, but he isn't even the clear best player in the 2016 draft class."
"Are you insane? He's amazing.

EDIT: By your logic, Ovechkin isn't generational then?"
"About to pass Wayne Gretzky on the “goals as a teenager” list, but not even close to generational, damn, your bar is high. "
"> Elite? Yes. Generational? Nope.

Call me in 3 years, let me know what's what."
"> Laine is a damn good player, a franchise player for any team, but he’s not generational. A generational player only occurs once per generation of players, as the name suggests (Crosby, McDavid). If Laine is a generational talent then what about Eichel, Matthews?

Regardless of whether Laine is generational or not, is there some kind of a Hockey God supervising and making sure this only happens once per generation?

I don't think Laine is ""generational"" in the most traditional sense which is usually reserved for centers, perhaps generational goal scorer if Ovechkin is one, but your definition above makes little sense."
"Keep fighting the good fight. If Laine is generational than Matthews is generational. And so is Eichel. And of course so is McDavid. So by that logic we've had a ""once-in-a-generation player"" four times in the last three years."
On pace for 47 as a 19 year old.... I'd call that generational...
3 consecutive goals
"To add to that -- without anybody scoring on the opposing team, either. All three have to be consecutive with no other scoring in between any of them, regardless of which team does it."

"
Not for us!
It'll be Laine > Gretzky in a few games when he passes him in goals as a teenager.
Gretzky banged a goat confirmed 
Lainetzky.
Nowhere and everywhere
"Leafs fans never doubted Laine's talent and being a good player...just those idiots saying ""Laine is better""..."
That was the last logo the Jets had before moving to Phoenix.  It's a remade version of the traditional logo that they broke out in the early 90s.
I see highlights here and there but love this last stretch of games because we get to see Laine and McDavid and it’s amazing watch them. I always forget Laine is 6’5
And ship him to Pittsburgh 
"Is it possible he scored this goal, whilst looking grungy, for his father, who attends and helps out at golf courses?

"I have brought a goal, and another goal, and another goal, and so a hat trick to my new empire!"
HAH! YES!
"Crosby also had 147 assists his first two seasons. Laine is on pace for 51.

I get the Laine hype train is in full gear but it's a really odd comparison when Crosby was and is known primarily as a playmaker."
it only makes him.. STRONGER
Something like that
If you want to talk generational you need to compare him to people drafted within many years of him.
That's still not the point. Being the best player of your draft does not make you generational. 
"Sure.

Laine is on pace for 7 more goals than Crosby over two seasons. Laine is on pace for 96 less assists than Crosby over two seasons.

Goals don't matter THAT much more to overcome that disparity."
"You sure about that? I heard about some guy who seemed pretty good at shooting, his name was ovechkitten or something similar to that?"
"It probably doesn’t help that this a thread about Laine so there’s lots of Jets fans lol. But yeah, I’m just trying to start a discussion but I’m getting mass downvoted :("
"Jets fan on your side with this one.  Unless you want to call all of Gretzky, Messier, Sakic, Yzerman, Francis, Lemieux, Jagr generational we're really stretching the term  here (even if you want to call Jagr and Sakic a different generation from the rest) I'll give Bourque and Lidstrom the 2 generational nods from 1980-2010 for d-men

Nobody except Crosby is really in that tier yet even with era adjustments

1st ballot hall of famer is a term I'm ok with speculating over "
He’s a generational talent as a shooter... not as an overall player. 
"That’s true but imo he’s not generational. If he is, then what about Eichel and Matthews? Maybe someone like Boeser? Suddenly there’s generational talent everywhere when it’s supposed to be once a generation. That’s my take on it but I guess you could use generational in a different sense, such as “really fucking good” lol"
"To be fair, if Gretzky wasn't born in January he would have way more than 76. "
Comparing goal scores to playmakers is just odd. Gretzky had more assists in his rookie season than Laine will probably get in his first three years. 
RemindMe! 3 years
what exactly classified a player as generational?
"To be fair it's been crazy three years.

While I agree that generational is probably the wrong word here (at least for now;)), I don't think it's defined by how many of these players there are at any given time.

If three players start putting 200p/season are they not generational because there's three of them?"
"Laine is on pace for 73 points in his second season. Crosby had 120 points in his second season. McDavid put up 100. 

And scoring is higher this year than in Crosby's second season. And McDavid's. We're really just throwing the term generational around now. 

"
Thanks
"That is a pretty terrible scoring slump though, I hope I never see Laine do that again"
"Yea it is pretty unfair if 19 year old, or any player for that matter goes 4 NHL games without any points and there are some people who will consider that as a slump."
Have a good day and sweet dreams *:
Isn't kind of cheating though since Gretz only had one season as a teen in the NHL?
There were those who called him a one trick pony that completely sucked ass at everything else and that the only goals he could score were empty netters.
Oh neat. I didn't even know it existed. 
Almost that entire team seems like they are giants. Was at one of the games they played in Nashville and those fuckers towered over our guys. 
"WHAT! that kid is huge! 

that is like a full foot taller than me! "
"Well, his father was there, Laine plays golf and I bet he's father's at least been on the course with him and that beard is more than a bit ratty.

So yeah, spot on."
"But your reddit account has to ""hold"" bitcoin. It's a bitcoin account at that point, no? A ""sort-of bank account""?

"Oh the times when we made some Boneshine in the forest, wrestled with Beers and went to a hot Sun-ah!"
"Fair enough, Crosby is amazing!

But so is Laine!"
I think the comparison is because Crosby is on the list for most goals by a teenager and that is what we're discussing here...
"Crosby is and should be known as a *complete player*. The last 10-15 games Laine has been much better overall, but he's primarily an elite sniper thus far. There's no comparison with Crosby anywhere else. "
I guess we'll see in 5 years or so who people are still talking about.
No but being the best sophomore goal scorer in over a decade might indicate that he is. The fact that he is now leading the league in goals since he joined the league despite missing a number of games is another indicator that he might be. 
"How about the best player of 5 drafts, hypothetically?"
You cant straight up compare those stats since during Ceosbys first 2 seasons scoring was higher than it has been in past few seasons. Agreed on your point tho.
"Don't worry, he will have a ton of assists too, he is a brilliant playmaker.  Hockey genius."
"A greater percentage of Laine's shots go in the net. Like, 50% more."
"I would argue he's a generational shooter, much like Ovechkin or Stamkos (but not a generational **overall** player like Crosby or McDavid). Ovechkin is a generational goal scorer, being the greatest goal scorer of his generation, I'd argue that if Laine continues his trend he will be one of if not the best goal scorer of his generation, thus being a generational shooter/scorer. But no he's not an **overall** generational player."
">Unless you want to call all of Gretzky .... Lemieux .... generational we're really stretching the term here

I think you made a mistake here."
"Yup... Should be talking about Mike Bossy/Brett Hull comps, not in the generational tier as are neither of the 2 I mentioned"
Maybe not in all facets but in terms of goal scoring he **might** be. 
"You are all over this thread I guess in an attempt to save Crosby's legend. You don't have to, Crosby is amazing and HOF.

Give Laine some credit."
"No ones saying Laine is better than Crosby or Gretzky, I don’t understand why you’d think these stats aren’t noteworthy anyways."
"Once in a generation player with the stats to back it up. 

Crosby had 75 goals his first two seasons. Laine is on pace for 82.

Crosby had 147 assists his first two seasons. Laine is on pace for 51.
"
"Sure, but what they are doing statistically isn't really that crazy.

Laine is on pace for 47 goals and 29 assists for 76 points in his second season.

Crosby put up 36 goals and 84 assists for 120 points total in his second season.

And this year is higher scoring than Crosby's second year."
"Yes I believe you can have multiple generational talents over a couple years if the talent is there. Just because the term is *generational talent* does not mean “there can only be one!” And we have them all fight to the death. 
I do think Ovi qualifies the man is arguably the most prolific goal scorer ever so you would have 2 generational talents back to back there.


Also I don’t think Laine is there. Clubs usually don’t have a generational talent ply on the 3rd line."
"Scoring is also spread around the entire team more, Crosby can't get close to hitting to 100 in the last few years."
Isnt it kind of cheating though that Gretzky had his season in 79/80 where goalies and players sucked ass compared to today?
"Yeah, and they were idiots saying that. Most level-headed Leafs and Jets fans acknowledged that there was no 'winner' between the two teams. The Leafs got a franchise player. The Jets got a franchise player."
"Yeah, Wheeler, Buff, Myers are all 6'5 or over. There's probably others too "

https://np.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/index"
It's more that they are using that comparison to support why Laine is a generational talent. And I'm saying that it's an odd argument when what made Crosby generational wasn't his goal scoring ability.
"Crosby became a complete player but was by no means a complete player in his first two seasons.

His injuries really led to him focusing more on his defensive game and less on driving the net and racking up the points."
Try in 10 years when the careers of people drafted 5 years after Laine can be compared to Laine.
Why do you keep saying this like people will only be talking about Laine in 5 years? It's hilarious.
McDavid?
Not entirely true though. Goal scoring is higher this season than Crosby's second season.
"I think you're trolling, but can't quite tell....."
"Ovechkin also takes a million more shots than Laine, he's a shot generating machine."
"Yeah, that’s pretty much how I see it. "
"Well that's kind of my point, I'd give them the generational nod, rest are in the 1st ballot hof class"
"Yeah, he’s easily a generational goal scorer, but I wouldn’t say he’s a complete generational talent. "
"He's definitely a generational goal scorer. I think he's a generational player as well, but opinions will vary on that."
"His goal scoring rates aren't particularly exceptional , especially 5v5 he's not even top 50 in gs/60 over the past two seasons. "
"Meh, more the word ""generational"". I'll gladly defend McDavid too but  the original OP compared Laine to Crosby.

Also, this comment is about Gretzky so kinda odd to mention this here."
I think it's more noteworthy to compare it to someone like Ovi then pass-first players. 
So you’re saying Ovie isn’t generational because Sid already got the slot for his generation?
Higher scoring era.... in Crosby rookie year 7 guys had 100 points or more.
Yeah agreed.
"That and also that Crosby is 30, has a history of injuries that has made him more of a perimeter player, and he also plays a 200-foot game now. "
"Not really,"
"Ya I like Laine & think he is a solid piece & player for the Jets.

but both Laine & Matthews are different style players, Laine is a goal scorer, he is like Ovechkin. While Matthews is more like Crosby a two way player that will contribute in both goals & assists."
there was a winner
+ Buff weighs half a team.
Hendricks?? I think..
Thanks for the explanation! Appreciate it!
Wasn't *only* his goal scoring ability 
"Edit: I'm an idiot, need to work on reading, nothing to see here"
"As a teenager, he was certainly more complete than any teenager I'd ever seen play. He's definitely matured and improved but you could see he had a game above his years. "
"He was a complete offensive force though, and not just a shot. He would gain the zone. hold it in. Dig it out from the corners, shoot from anywhere. On the backhand. Bat greasy pucks in out of the air. He can play every role on offense, and has always been so effective at stripping pucks in the d zone, that he didnt really have to develop the ability to play without the puck. I think he's the greatest grinder since Gordie Howe! Screw the defense, I want more one handed backhanders."
"Okay, let's meet in the middle and say 7."
"> people will only be talking about Laine

Didn't say that."
"Post-McDavid.


Besides, McDavid will be in therapy in a season or two after playing for the Oilers and carrying them to 27th place over and over again..."
I misread your comment. Thought you meant none of the above were generational. 
"Some generations have no generational players. Some have multiple. It averages out to about ""once-in-a-generation"" IMO.

I would say Ovi has the stats to back up being a once-in-a-generation player for the last generation with Crosby. I would argue that only McDavid has the stats to back up being the once-in-a-generation player for the new generation.

"
"This year is higher scoring than Crosby's second year. So it wasn't a higher scoring era.

We have four players on pace for 100 points or more. And seven on pace for 90-100 points. "
"I still don't think Crosby would be scoring at that pace. Ovy hade 100 point in a season early in his career... been relatively healthy, average defensive player, still can't get close to 100 again."
Then I'll say it's not really cheating for Laine either
"You guys got what you needed, and we got what we needed.  

And the most important thing is that neither of them went to Edmonton."
he's probably pretty buff too
"Yeah, even when he was young he had lower body strength like nothing I've seen. His defensive game in open-ice has massively improved but he's always been a monster on the boards. "
Best i can do is 3. 
You're implying it.
There’s only been 2 drafts since McDavids year and even then there are still some players that are better than Laine (as a complete player) like Matthews for example. Laine is probably the best goal scorer since then (Boeser and Matthews are pretty good too though) but as a complete player there are definitely some players better than him. 
"Right now Laine has done something only a few players have done previously in all history. That’s a lot of generations.

Pretty sure it’s okay that people are starting to wonder if Laine is in fact a generational talent."
"""Higher scoring era"" is better defined by comparing goals scored per game. All games, not just these players."
Crosby put up 120 points in a year with lower scoring than this year so...
Your damn right about that!
And still no Selke.. :(
"> who is talked about **more**

"
We'll see if people are talking about Matthews in 2023...
Matthews is a better goal scorer than laine. Both are great but i give matthews the edge there.
"Generational scorer, sure. 

But for generational player, he doesn't have nearly the assist totals to back that up"
This year has a higher goals scored per game than Crosby's second year. 
Smart money says yes.
"You're being down voted but look at the stats. Matthews dominates laine in 5v5 G/60

edit: to cite some actual numbers

players with comparable 5v5 GS/60 as matthews (2.95 GS/60) the past 2 seasons with 500 minutes min TOI: Brad Marchand (3.73), McDavid (3.4). Kucherov (3.14), Tarasenko (2.89), Malkin (2.86), Crosby (2.69 -- nice)

players with comparable 5v5 GS/60 as laine (2.26) : Brent Burns (2.3), Mitch Marner (2.3), Dustin Brown (2.27), Michael Backlund (2.27), Tuevo Teravainen (2.25), Vinnie Hinostroza (2.25), Charles Hudon (2.24), Antoine Roussel (2.23)

"Misread/misunderstood.

You are right, but higher only by the smallest possible margin so far (0.01) while compared to 2005-06 the difference is greater.

https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/stats.html"
"So Laine is the better goal scorer, Matthews is the better overall player? I think that's fair."
"The stats don't really indicate that Laine is better at scoring goals except in 5v4, where neither is particularly efficient -- unless you consider voracek, kadri, galchenyuk, and carlson to be generational goal scorers  based on their 5v4 production rate lol. Matthews is definitely a better goal scorer 5v5. And guys like Eichel are better 5v4 goal scorers than Laine anyways. Laine is very good and an elite goal scorer but certainly not generational"

"Minus the Habs, that's what it's looked like for me for the entirety of the time I've been here, because I prefer to use reddit with CSS off.


If you have CSS on, you see the Habs logo beside u/Bill_Fuck's name? And the Oiler logo beside mine? I see a grey box beside his that says ""MTL - NHL"", and ""EDM - NHL"" beside mine.


But in basically every single other usage of logos, it's never been implemented to include a text-based alternative for people with subreddit styles off. So I've never had links in the table linked above, and even in GDTs and PGTs I don't know which stats belong to which team, if I want to use a PGT to check the box score then I'm perusing through the names of the goal scorers in which periods to deduce who actually won.


[This is what it looks like to me and a lot of other people who use reddit similarly.](https://imgur.com/a/uW2kR) Don't mean to bitch and moan but I don't get why the same or a similar thing that's been done with flairs can't be done with the rest of the uses of team logos.

"technically, you are correct, which, of course, is the best kind of correct. However, sport club stats has winnipeg's chances of finishing as the first wild card at 0.226% and nashville's as 0.00324%, so that would be a pretty epic collapse."
This is the main complaint I have with the current playoff format. Having divisional series is fun of course but I kind of miss the thrill of possibly being matched up with any other team in the conference regardless of division. It also makes it possible for two teams from the same division to meet in the conference finals if they truly are the best teams.
So you're saying theres a chance?

Something has to have changed. I haven't been able to eat it for about a year. Either I'm getting too old or the recipe was adjusted. Probably the former but I like the latter option better.

Erik Johnson at 6mil is bad because he gets injured apparently
I had no idea Parise has 7 years left at that cap hit. Jeezus. I thought we had it bad with Bobby.
"The top six or so I agree with.

Then it's just ""WELL HES OLD AND THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY SO BAD CONTRACT"". "
There's no way Nielsen is our worst contract. I'd give that honor to Abby or maybe Ericsson.
Nothing shows how further we've come as an organization than a list like this where we barely make a blip anymore.
"Luongo should be higher on the list if I'm being honest. He's still excellent, but he's been injured more and more and who knows how long he can keep playing. 

I was actually surprise the worst contract on the team was not Ekblad."
"????

Andy Greene is so fucking reliable in the D zone. Our Best defensive D man. "
In what world is 1 year left on Paul Martin a worse contract than boedker? 
Blasphemous as it might seem I honestly think I hate Weise's contract more than AMac's at this point.
I like the Goligoski contract. Makes you wonder why they didn't pick the Mike Ribeiro contract
"Callahan isn't the player he was, but christ can the guy kill penalties with the best of them. He reads the play so well and shot calls to his players on the ice during a PK. He still forechecks hard and throws hits. Even had a flash of offence this season playing on the top line + PP. Cap hit still sucks but it's only 2 years."
"> Eriksson never jelled with the Sedins...

I've never seen that spelling for gelled before.

Edit: Apparently, both are correct.   [Gelled](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gelled)  [Jelled](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/jelled)"
"This is full of contradictions. Dubinsky is overpaid by 1.5/2 million and this makes him one of the worst, but Backes' being paid more for slightly less production (this year aside) isn't as bad? Nielsen's isn't bad yet, but could become bad, so it's one of the worst, yet Brouwer's 4.5 million isn't crazy money despite him contributing nothing?"
"> Though Orpik is as mean as they come on the back end, that shouldn't result in such a high cap hit. However, he should be serviceable for one more year.  
  
God no... he's been a sieve on the back end and worse than Chorney when we had Chorney..."
How is okposo on this. He's top 6 forward we got for $6 mil as a UFA. But I guess it's a bad contract since he had a bad start after spending the off-season in a ICU
Didn't have to go far to find Eriksson. Woof.
"Out of all the shitty Red Wings contracts, you pick Nielsen?? He is still great defensively, while producing offense on a bottom feeder team."
Interesting to see toews nowhere and heart breaking to see darling.
Technically Ilya Kovelchuck had the worst contract ever 
"Hot-take analyses with little to no depth.  Thanks for the clickbait.

Martin's deal was great and he wouldn't have made the list had he not been hampered by that nagging injury.  Whether he rushed himself back too early or the injury was deeper than the medical staff had ascertained/diagnosed is anyone's guess.  And that injury opened the door for younger defensemen, Ryan and Heed, to graduate from the AHL and demonstrate their mettle in and deserving of being in the NHL (though why DeMelo is played over Heed is beyond the understanding of the entire fanbase at this point...).

For what he has brought to the Sharks during his tenure in teal has been well worth it and it's sad that his season has gone the way it has.  That he wasn't picked up off waivers a few weeks ago and that no one wanted him at the deadline augurs poorly for him, that his injury might have spelled the end of his career."
"The Parise contract shows me that I'd never make it as a GM. When he hit the market I wanted the Devils to keep him for literally any amount of money and any amount of years.

7 years left at 7 per is *brutal* for the guy. Woof. "
Goligoski is actually having a fabulous year. 
"Eh, I'd have had Zaitsev as Toronto's worst contract. What on earth is that Martin pick, anyway? Why would a 2.5mil ever be the worst contract on a team? "
"I knew Brent Seabrook's contract was a lead weight on the Blackhawks but somehow I missed the fact that he'll be 38 when it finally ends. If Bowman can get rid of that one without sacrificing half the team, he's a damn wizard. A wizard who grants shitty contracts but a wizard nonetheless."
Carey is just getting paid what every super star is now going to get paid 
"Allen over Berglund, huh?  That’s a bold choice."
Spot on with Allen. An expensive backup
"Surprised they didn't mention Kesler. Perry def isn't the player he used to be, but he still tries.. sometimes...."
Parise being the worst of the worst isn’t surprising. But what he does off the ice makes him loved in Minnesota. Hopefully he’ll restructure and help the team make some cap room. 
"Hahaha what the fuck? EJ isn't even near our worst contract. At this point he *is* our defense. Plays 25 minutes a night, can be depended on in every situation and is one of the leaders in the locker room. Sure, he will most likely be overpaid at the end of the contract, but even then I doubt it will be much of an over-payment.  
  
I'd argue that our worst contract is Söderberg. He's been great this season, but gets paid way too much. Take a million or two off his salary and I'd be really happy with the contract."
">> Brouwer doesn't give the Flames anything, really, but $4.5 million isn't ridiculous money, **and this deal can be disposed of fairly easily.**Grade: 6/10

It feels really good to not see Dustin Brown's name at the top of these rankings for a change. Long live the Brownaissance!
"Wasnt a fan of Prices contract from the get go. We have promising goalie prospects, Lindgren already proving his is reading for the big leagues. Now the Price contract handicaps us now and even more for the future."
I only opened this out of curiosity as to whether they would pick Goligoski or hold Bolland against us. Either way it's a good situation. Goligoski has been one of the most consistent Defenseman in the NHL over the past decade and he is on pace to have one of his best offensive seasons this year at 31 years old. I'm not too worried about him. Especially considering the Cap is likely to raise by nearly 10 million $ by the end of his contract. 5.5 million is currently market value for a good #3 Defenseman and will age with him as the Cap goes up.
ONE MORE YEAR. ONLY 1 MORE SHITTY $5.5M YEAR ~~WASTING OTHER TALENT'S ICE TIME~~ LEADING OUT SHITASS DEFENSE WITH SOME SHITASS VETERAN EXPERIENCE.
"Paul Martin's contract is not bad. He played a huge role with the team for the first few years of his deal, but injuries and age have caught up with him. 

Luckily for the Sharks, he's in the last year of his deal. "
"If Allen is our worst problem, I'm okay with that; after five years of dealing with the ""will-he, won't-he be starter,"" I've grown numb to it."
Half of those contracts aren't even terrible. o.O
"No Clarkson and Horton?

Dustin Brown that low....really?"
"Putting up garbage opinions to get clicks. If I offer people Lucic on his contract or Price on his contract, how many take Lucic? None, yet they are rated equally bad. "
"A few obvious ones, but overall, a terrible article."
Sheary may take over Hagelin's spot soon. 
The players poll just even had him as one of the best goalies of all time. 
"I think his Hart season really messed up everyone's perception of him. Yes he is a very good goalie. But he really should be viewed as as around the 5-7ish best goalie every year instead of top 2. If you take out that Hart season, he has been good but **nowhere** near ""best goalie in the world"" over the past few years.

He never should have been viewed as ""generational"" or ""undisputed #1"" like he was. Half the reason he won the Hart is because the Art Ross/Rocket winners were record lows.

Although the injuries definitely drastically sped up his decline."
we won’t win a cup with a goalie making taking that much of the cap space
"yes, and he's not wrong"
"If he shows up in the playoffs again you wont care about him not producing as much as he should (especially in the goal department) in the regular season
"
Yeah i dont think bones is the predators worst contract.
"I wonder what the average for #1 centers is. Like you said, you needed him either way."
"I think Poile had the ability to overpay on the Johansen contract mostly because of the bargains he got with the Ellis, Josi, Ekholm, and Arvidsson contracts. "
We’re number 1!
Also they don't take into account that there is a strong chance they can just shelf Parise on LTIR and not worry about his contract.
"Just read that too, what the actual fuck?

""Yeah, your #1 dman who playes 26 minutes a night against other teams top forwards, has a 0.41 PPG, on a very reasonable contract gets hurt sometimes. 6/10 contract"""
"He got graded in the middle of the pack, probably because there was no one on a worse contract. 

It makes some amount of sense though. Over his career, Johnson's averaged 68 games per season - not counting this season, the 12-13 shortened season, or the 08-09 season that he missed entirely. A guy with a history of getting hurt who's about to turn 30 and still has five years left on his deal after this season is definitely something of a worry. "
Like to lump his deal with Suter so I feel better about it. 
"I don't actually think Bobby Ryan's contract is *that* bad. I mean, it hasn't been great the last couple of years on the stats sheet, and I didn't think he played that great in his first season or two with the sens, before they even signed this contract, so I was upset when they signed him to that. 

But, watching him now, I think if he didn't keep breaking his hands every second game, he would be worth the price tag, or if not, very close. Bobby Ryan is a good player. He's not too old or playing badly. He has gotten a lot of trouble from his hands. And it's not like he injured his knee and has never been the same sort of deal either. When he heals, he's back to great hockey, but he keeps getting re-injured. 

So, I think that he could very well have a great next 4 years on his contract. There's no reason why he wouldn't, which I think is a significant difference as compared to a lot of the guys on that list."
Seriously. It seems like he was signed longer ago than that.
"I mean... to be fair, that’s generally a recipe for a bad contract."
"Which would've worked fine for us, but instead they went after Allen since he's not having a great year?"
almost like high cap hits for really old players is the definition of poor value
Zajac is easily our worst contract.
When they’re 29 on a 4 year deal like this wtf kind of rating is this
Probably because Nielsens is at a higher aav and approximately the same length as the others. Though I'm sure we can all agree that all three contracts are bad or will be bad soon enough 
Because you hired a wizard who made David Clarkson and Dion Phaneuf disappear.
"Shit, Luongo should be on the list for Vancouver. Canucks better hope he LTIRetires. "
"There's very little chance he's a quality starter at 42, that contract was graded very generously. I totally forgot Vancouver extended him forever"
"Yeah, i thought it'd be zajac tbh."
Because we're probably just wasting money on him for the last two years of his contract while he's in the ahl?? At least Boedker is playing
"I mean he's put up more points this season than Aaron Ekblad in 1 less game and is getting paid $2mil per year less. 

I don't see people here complaining that Ekblad's contract is shit. "
"I don't think buyouts or LTIR were elligible.

I probably would have picked Demers. He's overpaid. "
2 years ain't bad at all. 
Yeah I almost want to say he's been a stud this year. In all of his games and on any line he's been great.
"Why ""this year aside?"" The past means nothing to the present with older players. Backes has almost double Dubinskys current point total  and double his goals. "
Dubi also has permanent  injuries this year.  He has to wear a visor because of his eye.  That injury sounds like it almost LTIR'd him.
"for one more year

for one more year

for one more year

Wrong, wrong, and still wrong."
"Especially because we are paying Moulson $5 mil a year to not play in the organization.

That's one of the worst contracts in the league, though at least it is ending soon.

But obviously the consistent 50 point player who had one off year because of extenuating circumstances is a problem at $6 mil."
"Since all the teams need to be represented I guess he's just the ""worst"" we have? All our true bad contacts are a lot shorter and will be off the books in three or less years so I guess they went with the guy with a longer term and an off year."
"Clearly he's not a team player, spending all his free time in ICU! "
"Thank you for taking him off our hands, after he was done scoring 30 goals per season"
Toews' contract is worth it :)
"Parise's contract would have been fine and perfectly reasonable if the league hadn't decided to punish teams for signing guys to contracts that were within the rules when the contracts were signed. The untradeable cap recapture penalty is just a petty, bullshit punishment."
I heard Devils did try to keep him and he chose Min over you guys.  Which I'm sure hurt at the time but seems great now.    
Now that he's had his back surgery we are hoping the injury bug is gone.
"""Carey is just getting paid **at age 31** what every super star is now going to get paid **in their early 20's**""

FTFY"
"And weve seen that with Luongo, Rinne, Lindquist elite goaltenders can play at a high level into their mid to late thirties"
"Expensive if he *stays* a backup. Yeah, he's hit a struggle point the last two seasons, but given how the entire team's looked like shit the past few months, it's hard to say if Allen's still playing like garbage, or like Hutton's recent numbers, is just suffering because the team in front of them has their heads surgically implanted in their asses. "
Wait what?  Are you suggesting that Kesler doesn't try? 
"Can't restructure or trade the cap hit. Short of a buyout, LTIR, or the league removing the cap recapture penalty, we will have that cap hit for the next 7 years."
Not really sure Clarkson and Horton count. 
Horton's doesn't hit our cap and we're rolling in money. It doesn't impact us at -all-. 
there are many garbage opinions on there but both of the contracts you mentioned are pretty awful
"I'd say he has already.  Hagelin doesn't look out of place on Malkin's line lately, he's a great penalty killer, and he's one of the fastest players in the NHL.

Sheary, on the other hand, is barely clinging to the 4th line right now.  He had 53 points in 61 games last season, this season he only has 22 points in 64 games, and offers no special teams intangibles."
I'd bet on Sheary bouncing back instead of becoming the worst contract on the team. 
Either him or Hunwick.
He already has his spot. Hagelin kills penalties
True :(
He's a fucking loser. No one likes him.
"Eh, I don't mind his production this year. I'd obviously like him to score more, but our point production has been pretty spread out across the board this year. "
"He's got a rash starting, confirmed by Russo."
"He has missed 92 games over the last 4 years which is more than a season's worth of games and 145 over the last 6.

He can be great when he's playing but if he's missing that many games (and when he's not playing your team is worse because of that cap space not used elsewhere) then the contract can still be bad.

Durability isn't something you get to just ignore unfortunately, especially because players typically become more injury prone as they age."
"Yeah, did a double take as I was scrolling down. Totally expected to see Soderberg."
"> There's no reason why he wouldn't, 

Uh really...? Doesn't he have like 25 hand injuries the last few years?

I mean, it's like Lupul, the injuries were all seemingly random like he was just unlucky and he was going to turn into a beast the following year but after a certain amount of time you have to put 2 and 2 together.

Ryan could return to form but it's still much more likely that he doesn't and there is certainly not ""no reason"" for that."
"that's great that you think that, but i can assure you - it is that bad"
He’s almost certainly a buyout candidate after the next cba/lockout. He’s been rounding back into form recently but they’ll hit him with a buyout and just pay the 1.2 million a year forever. It’s basically how the contract was designed. 
Some of them are tail ends. Like Greene's. He's been our best defenseman for over half a decade at $5m. And our captain. He just had two years left.  Definitely not a bad contract
"I can understand mentioning that he's not yet had a season where he's been a true starter in the sense that he doesn't stumble at some point and cause the backup to take over...but at the same time, he's certainly not the worst of our contracts considering how relatively small his cap hit is. "
Are you referring to Steen? or Bouwmeester?
Nielsen's taken a beating this year. :(.
Imagine how boned their rebuild would be if they still had those albatrosses
is it possible to learn this power..?
He signed if before the rules were implemented so i doubt we get recapture penalties. Canucks will just take it to court and will win. 
I thought you guys loved Zajac?
"Dubi was hurt for quite a while, so I assume that's why."
I'm really getting tired of Bogosian being injured all the time
"Except goalies have a completely different development curve and hit their prime at much later dates. Price didn't even become a starter until he was like 25. Bob, Rinnie, Crawford, Quick, etc all players who have hit their prime in their late 20s or early 30s "
"What do Luongo, Rinne, and Lundqvist all have in common? "
"No, could have broken up the two statements. They are independent of each other. 

Kesler hasn't looked good this year because of his hip surgery. Pretty much had to relearn how to skate. "
I never knew they couldn’t restructure. In that case Parise contract is 12/10 shitty. 
"> Uh really...? Doesn't he have like 25 hand injuries the last few years?

Yes, but that won't necessarily happen again in the following years. We'll see. I don't really know, but when you take a slapshot to the hand, it's going to break no matter who you are. And I think he came back often not fully healed which made it more liable to break. After the long offseason, I don't think it will necessarily be a problem next year. We'll see though I guess. I don't really know because I don't have specific enough information to make a proper judgment on that, but it seems to me, like once his hand is fully healed, if he doesn't get really unlucky again, he should be worth his contract. 

"
"Right, I assumed that’s what sparked this comment, but a lot of them are legitimately bad. Tail end or not.

Brouwer, Martin, Orpik, MacDonald, and Callahan were all bad contracts when they were signed."
"Sure but they aren't rating what the worst contract was when it was signed. This is more of a ""most overpaid"" list."
Clarkson would be on LTIR so it wouldn't matter for him
Not from an Oiler (legend who promptly joined the old boys club running the team into the ground).
What court lol whoever the Canucks rep was at the time knew how things were going to work when they signed off on the CBA. 
"We generally do but his $5.75M cap hit for fairly pedestrian scoring. He's like a 0.5PPG player but his defensive upside is worth a lot. He had some big seasons when we had Parise/Kovalchuk around which may have inflated his offensive worth a bit leading to his $5.75M contract. A lot of fans feel he never lived up to that dollar value. 





"
"Backes missed a fair chunk of time for a big surgery too, though"
"Fair, but none of those goalies make $10.5 million a year "
all is goalie ))
"You can't name a drink after any of them, because there's no Cup to put it in."
Cheaper contracts to allow better defensive cores to be in front of them?
"Off and on and it did seem pretty bad, but Cally's been great on the ice by the eye test at least. Still a lot of money though."
"The way they worked that trade with Columbus was great. They give up an insured, (at the time) healthy player paid a bit too much, dragging on the cap, get back the uninsured, injured,  Nathan Horton who they can LTIR for cap relief, and have the cash to actually pay. Great case of win-win trading. "
Oh really? I didn't know. I don't really watch the Bruins enough haha. Our whole team has been down offensively this year- Dubi especially.
"Lundqvist makes 8.5m and got that contract in 2013 when the cap was 70m compared to now where its 75m and will increase to 78-82m next year. 

Bob is making 7.4m and it ends next year, with contracts like that you think hes going to accept 8m when hes been playing better than most goalies?

Crawford will likely get a raise too. Etc, etc. "
"Correct he's the highest paid goalie by 2 million. But people thought Rinne's contract was massive for a goalie in 2012/13 or Lundqvist's 8.5m in 2014/15. 

I think Carey Price salary is going to be a burden to the team but  I'm going to wait until Price actually starts his contract in 2018/19 before I make judgements on how much of a burden it will be. Because honestly the increased goalie salary and the increase to the salary cap at this point seem to be going hand and hand."
"Right now no, but Bobrovsky will definetly win at least 10 millions on his next deal"
Lundqvist's contract was the largest a goalie had ever gotten at that time and it took up around the same % of the rangers cap as prices does now 
"Yeah, I think in his case, it's just a bad contract because of the leverage he had after the trade with the NYR for St. Louis.

If he was paid a million or two less, it'd be fine."
"Credit to Jackets for that, I read they were the ones to propose it (although I had hear fans float the idea before).  "
Backes lost ~8 inches of his colon only to return in 1/2 the expected time
How many cups do those guys have?
26 games in a row ties Kane’s streak from a couple of seasons ago for the longest streak since Lemieux (28 GP) in 1996.

Don’t let Brock Lesnar near Hall. He doesn’t like streaks: 
"Death, Taxes, and Hall putting points in Games he plays.

Hall is fucking awesome to see and love how his season has been. It’s going to be a fight to the finish for the Hart."
Hall will get the Hart if the Devils make the playoffs

Another one."
this is getting ridiculous 
I will be mildly upset if Hall doesn't win MVP
"If he isn't top 3 in Hart voting, its a crime. Look at what he's working with. 

Still dislike him tho"
"Yea, ok.

But I'm sure Larsson has put up equal productivity in EDM

Edit. Apparently no one on reddit has dry humour"
"One4One

The sports app I use *The Score* says Taylor Hall has extended his point streak to 19 games. What are they on with?
"I'm so happy for the guy, after being squandered in the Oilers camp for so long."

Hellebuyck gonna put an end to that shit on Thursday.
Well this is misleading...he was injured at one point in the past 26 games so how does he have a 26 game point streak?
Whats the real streak? Part of the feat is not having time off in between games...
Give this man the damn Hart

I initially was happy to hear we got Chiarelli because I thought to myself, ""I don't have to worry about Hall getting traded because he must have learned what a dumb thing to do it is to move an elite young forward after what happened in Seguin trade."" Boy was I wrong. He's a head-in-the-sand type of guy that just manages decent trades when it comes to supporting cast players, but absolutely cannot make a trade involving an actual asset. It's honestly hard as a fan to not stress about what moves he might make to damage the franchise further.

Hold me."

Put some respek on Eagles name. 
That would be a cool comparison if Taylor Hall was a shutdown defenseman. 
you'd be lucky to get hall traded back for 8 larssons and a 1st
"Officially the point streak is 19 games because he had a 7-game point streak, missed 3 games due to injury, and is now on a 19-game point streak. So he has at least 1 point in the past 26 games he has participated in."
"Hope he gets a point in every game left this season. Chiarelli can cringe. Most Oil fans want to see him tear it up!

Still love Larsson just as much as Hallsy though."

"You're going to get downvoted - I guess I will too, but you're absolutely correct. For some reason everyone is fine with _giving_ Hall something he hasn't earned yet."
Has to be him or McKinnon right ? Both have been so amazing this year for there teams. 
MacKinnon 
No lol
i think they've only kept track since like 82-83
"Yeah his big competition are Malkin and Stamkos in my mind, but if you look at their teams they both have at least one teammate around the same point total whereas Hall doesn't have anyone even CLOSE to him. 

Since McDavid won last year, I'm confident Hall will be highly considered"
"""literally"""

As a habs fan i was actually happy when hall got his point 
Not the crying kid sitting behind me
"I once had a major surgery that required weeks to recover from. It was completely necessary and I'm better off having gone through it. I would not, however, have described myself as ""happy"" through that process.

Long story short, hockey is life and life currently sucks. The worst is that I want to take every opportunity to watch these games, but it's so hard to get into games where your team is just getting worked over day in and day out. But I also know that summer is just around the corner and soon I'll only have baseball... While it's a great time to be a Yankees fan, it's still no hockey."
"We feel nothing at this point. Don't worry about us, it was far from the worst game I've seen the Habs play this year XD."
"Fuck, that really puts this into perspective. Over 2 months."
Does that count as a fight? Is he looking for the Gordie howe hat trick?

"Meh, I’ve gotten alerts from the official NHL app with the extra 7 games added. It’s not official, but it’s just as good in the opinion of just about everyone. Not just Devils fans. "
Getting hurt and not missing a beat is even more impressive to me IMO. 
Yeah that 3 games with an injury when he didnt play was a real fuckin show stopper from hallsy
Kucherov?

This comment makes me feel violated. Don't post it again. We don't need sinful posts in the Christian subreddit.
Not until 2019. Hall must continue to score in every game he plays in 2018.
Basically the NHL being dicks.
"I don't really think he's underrated tbh. 

He's a good, but not amazing, defensive defenseman. He's an important part of the team but he's also not a gamechanger.

Still very much like having him on the team, but not at the cost of Hall."
"Larsson was very good last year. He played like a guy who could be the weaker half of a legit top pairing.

This year he's played more like the weaker half of a second pairing.

Hopefully he's able to figure out whatever was holding him back this season. It sucks for him that he has the loss of his father to deal with on top of whatever his issues were this season but I think he can bounce back.

Still a bad trade but Larsson is a good player and was a very good one last year."
He's not having a good season but I'm willing to give him a pass as he's been dealing with injury and the death of his father for much of the year. 
I don’t mean to play devils advocate but how is Larsson  seen as underrated he went 4th overall in 2011?? He’s been a well documented player through the ranks  
Hall for Larsson was a joke of a trade we could have got Harmonic for way less
You know Hall had 80 points in 75 games with the Oilers three years ago right?
"> Eberle, Hall & **Yak** are all striving elsewhere.

Well, at least you're 2/3 right."
"This season is Hall’s 3rd best p/60 of his career. He was great then, too. "
"Well that's stupid. If their careers are ruined how are they succeeding now? Hall and Eberle were royalty here until Chia showed up and we got McDavid. Also Hall is exactly now what he was then, a stud. First Oiler to hit 80pts since Doug Weight.

And how is Yak striving elsewhere with a whole 16pts this year?"
"Great, so just credit him with what he has earned. What's the problem?

The official record says 19? Then say 19."
"Kucherov is having an awesome season and probably the best season of anyone, but if you go by the definition of the Hart trophy I just don’t see how it doesn’t go to someone like Hall or MacKinnon who are physically carrying their respective teams."
"Tampa Bay is a playoff team w/o Kucherov, even if it was for the entire season.

NJ is a lottery pick team w/o Hall. "
It’s Mack and Hall for me
100% Its one of those years we might actually see close votings(if avs make the playoffs) vs most others years where one player generally stands out without a doubt.Right now  both equally deserve it.
As a Mooseheads fan I'm conflicted. MacKinnon is  having a monster year.
Either honestly 
*Edmonton’s
And then tell him he's sorry he went to Detroit.
"Who, after being drafted, will be promptly traded through time in return for Scott Gomez"
Felt bad until he spent the rest of the game cheering for someone to injure Hall.
"holy crap he literally has scored in EVERY game he's played in 2018

im officially on the hall for hart train"
"C'mon now. We all know a Gordie Howe Hat trick is a goal, an assist, and a 5 minute major for fighting."
Give me a yodel any day.
People like telling me about swiss rolls a lot too.
Because it’s called Taylor Ham
"I think if you could’ve moved RNH for him the team would be better for it. You get the defense, but you can run a top 6 anchored by a mcdavid line and a draisaitl-hall line is "
"Arm-chair GM, you don't know all the details I thinks."
and only needs 6 more points to tie that!
"On a 29-44-9 team a lot of players can have those type of points on a top line playing pointless games. 

This year he is on that pace for that plus more on a contending team playing important games. 

He’s a talented player but I’m just saying he’s better off overall in Jersey I don’t think he could have replicated that in Edmonton. "
Ya my bad on the yak thing I thought he was being somewhat productive since Colorado is a decent team 
"I guess success sometimes is defined by making the playoffs and being on a contending team. Remember it is a team sport. 
 
I’m just saying hall and eberle are in much better places for their careers individually and organizationally.

My bad on Yak I didn’t do proper research...send him back to Russia. "
The NHL official instagram also calls it a 25 (now 26) game streak. 
"Because he has played in 26 games with a point in each. 

That's 26 consecutive NHL games where Taylor Hall has got a point. 

Not 23."
"Because its consecutive games he's played in that we're celebrating. He has scored a point in 26 consecutive games that he has been a part of. 26 games in a row that featured Taylor Hall on the roster, not a healthy scratch, have produced points from the player named Taylor Hall. This is a thing he has earned. "
we have scored 1 goal without kuch in each game without him we go to shit but i still would give it to hall
Yeah we have this discussion all the time and I wouldn’t give to Kucherov simply because the rest of the team has been stellar. There was a better case last year when he was trying to drag an injured team into the playoffs 
"If you can chose either for MVP there is no level difference, hence no real MVP."
"...neither, honestly."

Slap that child
"*had a point, not scored"
They probably should've gotten the 5 but the refs didn't call it that way.

"As much as I never want Nuge to leave, I agree. But as has been well documented, Shero wasn't the one originally looking to move a player. Chiarelli was desperate to upgrade on defense...more than a little too desperate. 
"
You're seriously defending trading an all star left winger for a top 4 defender. Chia is an idiot and nothing is more telling then the eberle trade where it was reported that he asked for DeHann and strome but for some reason settled on just Ryan Strome. 
"Team success =/= player sucess

He played on teams with AHL defense and goaltending "
He'll do well in the KHL.
">I’m just saying hall and eberle are in much better places for their careers individually and organizationally.

Hall yes, Eberle maybe.

Eberle is on pace for 58pts which is right around his career average and NY is on the outside of a playoff spot which hopefully for them changes.

Kinda feels like you're just shitting on Edmonton without looking into anything here dude.

The Oilers don't ruin careers they just sucked at putting a proper team together. Yakupov is the outlier of the three, but who knows what would have happened if he'd been drafted elsewhere. "
"> consecutive games he's played in

He hasn't played in the 26 games consecutively... the record he has is 19 games! **No one celebrates non consecutive points records. If people did celebrate them, then the current record is even higher.**

But you know what, have at it man. 26 games it is..."
Yeah similar things for us without Hall. Devils scored a grand total of 2 goals without him and were shut out twice. 
"How are you not following this. 26 consecutive NHL games that he was dressed for.That he has played in. Not 26 consecutive New Jersey Devils hockey games. These are 2 different things. He, the player, has points in 26 consecutive hockey games **that he has been a part of.**"
"He had a point in 7 straight games, was out for 3, and is now on a 19 game point streak. Its 26 games not 23. No ones including the 3 games he was injured in his point streak."
">No one celebrates non consecutive points records. If people did celebrate them, then the current record is even higher.

They don't count the games he missed... wtf are you talking about? I think you're confused as to how this streak thing works. It's either 26, or 19. Nobody is adding the 3 extra games that he missed. "
26 games it is!
"Dude give up, you obviously aren’t going to change each others opinions so just agree to disagree."
Kinda seems like chia could’ve gotten a little more for him
yup hall deserves it 100 percent
"Hall has missed 5 games.  How can there be a grand total of 2 goals and only 2 shutouts?  That doesn't add up.

Edit:  Looked it up.  He missed Dec 14th and 15th games.

2-1 loss at Montreal

5-2 win vs Dallas.



There is still no doubt that the offense is anemic with him out."
"I thought he had missed 7 .. not 3. Edited now.

The point is, the official record books only count continuous games ... yet here the comparisons are made with Kane's streak (which was continuous) and Hall's discontinuous streak."
Nope. That’s the price of a shutdown dman. A top nhl franchise superstar. /s
My bad I thought he missed 5 I couldn’t find the other 2 he missed for some reason though 
"He didn't miss 7 games. He missed 3. 

He had a 7 game streak, then was injured for 3 games, then had another 19 game streak (the current one.) So, if you don't count the games pre-injury, its 19. If you count both, it's 26 (which is what people are currently counting the streak as). It'd be 29 if you counted the 3 injury games.

I can understand your confusion though, it would be bullshit to get 1 point in a game, miss 25 and then score in your next game back and say you have a 27 game point streak. The reason that people are differentiating the two, is because of the break in between the games. Apparently Lemieux played through injuries to keep his streak alive or something, which is why the NHL differs between the two kinds of streaks. 

Sorry for my original asshole-ishness :) "
"Per a lot of these peoples definitions though, if you score in the last 20 games of the season, and than the first 10 games of the next season, that's a 30 game point streak. Months of off season maintains a streak, but 3 games of injuries does not."
"> I can understand your confusion though, it would be bullshit to get 1 point in a game, miss 25 and then score in your next game back and say you have a 27 game point streak.


There is no confusion, I just switched the two numbers. My point still stands for what it was. He has a 19 game point streak. Hope he breaks the 26 game streak by Kane."

The Avs are still 2nd in the previous span though with 191 - wtf is going on in Denver?"
"The Pens are 10th in the league in PPO this year, *mayyybe* it was just some regression from earlier in the year. *MAYBE* it has something to do with small sample size and 7 out of 12 of their opponents being in the bottom 10 in times shorthanded. They've played a bunch of very disciplined teams lately and everyone knows their PP is deadly, so *maybe* the coaches of these already disciplined teams particularly stressed not taking penalties."
"Pens have a great PP. Pens have played a lot of disciplined teams lately. Most obvious reason for having a low number of PP opportunities is, conspiracy. Obviously."
 Now post the short handed goals against during that same period!?
DAE the refs favor the Pens?
cool thanks boys
ok
They took it too literally and actually cut off the February check
February is the month we don’t cut one in hopes that it’ll throw everyone off. Don’t you attend the meetings at Bettman’s house?

"It's possible. Though I do still see a ton of stuff not get called but yes it is reasonable to imagine this is a good strategy when your opponent has the #1 PP in the league.

Caveat, generally penalties are taken when you're trying to stop an opponent from scoring (at least smart ones are). And it just seems odd to me that with so many prolific scorers, teams can get away without committing as many penalties. "
"A really telling stat would be power play opportunities compared to penalty’s taken. 

A lot of games seem to average out, but not the Oilers. I looked it up a few months back, and they were about league average on penalties taken but by far have the least power play opportunities 

I just looked it up. 
167 power plays
203 penalty kills.

Bunch of young fast kids constantly moving will annoy anyone.

I dont think this post was about missed calls as much as pointing out that teams haven't put the pens on the pp as much after realizing that it is basically unstoppable.
No. Maybe watch the games and tally up the missed calls.
"I counted 4 blatant uncalled trips against the Pens in the Flames game. In plain sight of the stripes. No obstructions. Those are normally automatic. That's tripping infractions alone.

I'm not saying the refs are picking sides lately but they aren't doing their jobs. Common folk get fired for much less. They should at least be suspended or be reviewed by a board. That game shouldn't have went to OT."
Who is talking about a conspiracy here?
Soooooo Crosby?
"I was kinda fishing for everyone to do their own teams haha 

Life seems rough in Edmonton "
Yep 
"I'll do that as soon as you go tally up all the soft calls that were to your advantage for the first 4 months of the year, or you tally up all the missed calls for everyone else, because you aren't the only team that has missed calls against them.

The Pens were 3rd over that span. They're 10th overall. They aren't getting screwed by the refs any more than anyone else."
The worst one was the too many men missed call and the blatant hold in OT that the flames almost won on. 
"Yeah I don't like to complain about the refs, but they seem to be gunning for us this year. The number of missed calls on a certain fast player we have is crazy. Coupled with 19 straight goal challenges going against us, seems the league wants us to have another top pick."
">They aren't getting screwed by the refs any more than anyone else.

This wasn't true against the Islanders or the Flames just this past week. Go read through the game threads and you'll see a lot of comments about missed calls. 

Flames actually almost scored in OT when one of their players held a Penguin behind the play, not allowing him to join the play. 
"
"sample sizes... Any one game might swing one way or another, but I don't give a shit about your sample size of 2 just because the games were recent.

I'd be willing to bet the number of missed calls against balance out with missed calls in your favor over the course of a year.

Rinne is a Brick Wall. He can stop the pucks at ease.
"This is making me wonder: Will the Preds start giving Saros more starts next year(more of a 1A 1B situation)? It'll be Rinne's last year under his current deal, and I could see them testing the waters with Saros.


Would that be realistic? "

You mean the second round?
"That Game 2 when he made four or five complete robberies in overtime was so frustrating. Crawford, Rinne, and Thomas all played outstanding against us those playoffs - we were the #1 scoring team and the only goalie we could light up was Niemi."
"I was originally a Wings bandwagon/local fan due to the 2008 Cup, and when I was looking for NHL goalie to study and my goaltending style after I heard of some guy named Pekka Rinne nominated for Vezina. I decided to check him out since they were playing Vancouver the night I saw it, and watched him stand on his head in Game 2 and became hooked on him play, which led to my falling in love with the team and becoming a Preds fan for life "
We finns don't call him Betoni-Pekka (Concrete-Pekka) for nothing.
They have been giving him more and more. The last two years are the least amount of starts peks has had while healthy in a long time. I think that he is less than 50 games played on they year so far.
"Yes, and Rinne is 100% on board with it.

He may take a series of club-friendly 1-year deals before retirement, but the idea is to hand the crown to Saros, i.e. about a foot downward, lesser in stature but not lesser in the net."
*Beooooooooowww*
I always think about the Finnish announcer freaking out over an insane save he made during the SCF last year. I will never forget that. Someone needs to post that audio clip
Quick and Fleury look to be the next two that are likely to join this list. Quick needs 15 wins and 3 Shutouts. Fleury just needs 4 shutouts for 300/50 but with 3 more wins would join the 400/50 club.
Pekka rinne is too good right now

ANCHOVY
ASIAN
"It's been a while but yeah I was wrong on the round, 2nd is correct."
maybe he's from an alternate timeline 
"Makes sense, they've eased him into it. The fact that Saros is just as good as Rinne is amazing."
"Yeah, a 1 year deal would make sense for him. If he's still incredible next year, he'll want to continue until he can't."
Is it [this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehkVl0kA0qE)

My girlfriend didn't want me to switch it to March.
Correct.  He's tied with Osgood at 27th in just shutouts.

"That sounds like a good timeline. We have more postseason success, and 2011 Vancouver riot probably doesn’t happen."
"I honestly think that it is more bout how well pekka played in the playoffs last year since we didn't ride him as hard during the season. I think they probably had a set number of games that they wanted him to play from the beginning so that he is more rested than most for the playoffs. That being said, saros benefits from that."

Hedman otherwise

"Doughty, Subban, Hedman 

Could also go to Klingberg or Burns"
"Hedman, Klingberg, Doughty"
"Definitely don't expect a nomination, especially since his defensive game hasn't been where it should be, but it's crazy to see that despite missing camp and recovering from his surgery through the beginning half of the season (and playing on a trash team for the other half), Karlsson is still on a pace that would only be a couple of points back from Klingberg's lead (he's 7 points back rn with 7 fewer games played).

If we had been more in the playoff race, I think his name gets mentioned a bit more than he probably necessarily deserves this year."
Praying to god I don't have to eat a puck
I am sorry to all the Kings fans but there is no fucking way in hell Doughty should be ahead of Hedman. But he is definetly a 100% nominee
"No homer bias here, but Hedman has had an outstanding last half since he came back from injury. I’m very curious to see if others think that can beat out Klingberg/Doughty "
"Usually an injury will dampen their chances, but IMO I haven't seen anyone run away with it from Hedman, though I think Klingberg will steal a lot of votes from the Western Conference regions that don't see Hedman as much."
Risto!

2. Hedman

3. Doughty/ Subban"
"Dalton Prout, this is common knowledge people!"
Suter's having maybe his best season with us. But there's no chance he gets a nomination. Not even outside. Probably get some votes though.
I think you meant Sustr*. It's a common mistake. He is really good
"Big Burns fan but there is no way he should be in the Top 5, maybe even Top 10 for the Norris this year.  He's been absolutely terrible defensively, routinely out of position and turning it over on blind or home run passes.  Sure, his offensive skills are still fun to watch, but his lapses on D have cost the Sharks more than a few wins this year. "
Oh man for this reason alone I hope Klinger gets it 
Disqualified for poor maths
"He's playing great, on here I get such varied responses from MIN fans on Suter. Some say he's great, others say Spurgeon is far better, but in my opinion Suter is a top 10 defenseman. "
I think even our own fans don't appreciate what suter does. He just looks so damn complacent because he's almost never in the wrong spot. I remember did someone did a statical analysis from last year comparing top d men and suter defensive numbers were laughably better than everyone else. He doesn't get the Norris nods because of points usually but this year isn't he top 5 amon d men in points with the same crazy defensive stats? It's not insane to think he could at least be a finalist.
That's exactly how he was in Minnesota but without the ability to score 70 points. So he's gotten better at least.
It's such a tough call honestly. There are games where either is the better one. Spurgeon is having an incredible season too but unfortunately he missed some games.
I know he will be like a 99 in NHL 19.
"In terms of style of play not caliber (no offense to Suter), he reminds me of Lidström that way. He doesn’t usually blow people up or chase them down or make a diving poke check... because he took away the passing lane before the puck carrier saw it and that play never developed"

"> all time Bruins leader in OT wins

OT records are basically 21st century records, with a few old-timers from the 1920s and 30s thrown in. It's one of those stats where 'all-time' is misleading, because OT didn't exist for decades and has recently become much easier to score in.

Of the Bruins' top 10 goalscorers, only one has half as many OT goals as Marchand, and he's active (Bergeron). This is because:

* 5 never played a single period of regular season OT (Bucyk, Esposito, Hodge, Cashman, Orr), so they all have 0 OT goals.
* 2 others played out the primes of their careers without any OT (Middleton, McNab). They have 1 OT goal between them.
* 2 more played a lot of OT with Boston, but it was all 5-on-5 (Bourque, Neely).
* 1 is Patrice Bergeron."
Marchand is a beast!

All I hear es ELITE
Plenty of girls have the same mindset I'm sure
Bred Marchand
Waaaaaahhhh
"You must have been born after 2000 if you think that, go watch a game from the 90'ss"
Ulf Samuelsson and Matt Cooke would like a word.
I think we could all agree that the all-time leader in scum bag moves is Todd Bertuzzi.
How can one be upset about an injury but wish one on another? You're a horrible person. 
What a piece of shit thing to say 
Lol go fuck yourself😂
Waaaaahhhh
"I mean typically if you score a goal in OT you win
"
"> OT goals

> Nothing to do with wins"
Lol wat
one means the other
"yup. It totally sucks when something out of your control goes against your team. But you still have to give it to the team that capitalized on the mistake, because that wasn't luck."
maybe not shoot the puck right into him?
"Jared Coreau was the starter and let in 4 goals on 16 shots. Howard let in one in regulation and then got left out to dry in OT. Feel free to keep complaining about him when you didn't watch the game though. 

Doesn't even really matter though. Mantha and Larkin are the only talent on this team. "
As usual I have to scroll far down in r/hockey threads to see your dumbass shit
How does 'any OT goal in regular season' come anywhere near 'random time and set of circumstances'?
He's blatantly one of those players you hate if he plays for anybody else but you love him if he's wearing your teams colors 
That's without Bergeron centering the top line. Bergeron already got 2 hatties this season so he has to share the wealth.
We gotta beat the best to be the best of the best if uh we beat them to be that best?
Which Canadian city needs a makeover?
I exist to be a shit stirrer 
Eh you're cool. You're not like those Devils fans that seem to always get massively downvoted in any Bruins related post.

You're a child.
Wings looked pretty good offensively last night. Battled back a couple times and took the game to OT. No reason why they shouldn't be hunting for a playoff spot with that squad. 
Soooooo salty
Fuck you too buddeh
Holy fuck NJ fans are fucking whiny 
Let's not get carried away. 
"McAvoy, McAvoy, and McAvoy? I agree"
"Maybe 4? Bergy, Marchand, Chara, Rask"
"No he wasn't, and he still isn't without continued play at this level for 3-5 years. The Bruins have kept their dignity with retired numbers over the past decade+. "
"Or ""honored"". "
What about Tuuka?
I wonder who you'd rather have on your team
Why not? More points and also excellent defensively.
I'd say they are equal in terms of importance to the team. They are powerful independently but stronger together. Like Malkin and Crosby or Kane and Toews.
"Other years I would've said no way. When Bergeron has been out in the past, that line has suffered. This year though Brad is on another level -- he's shown he's able to control play on a line. "
And Bergy is obviously the best defensive forward but Marchand is no slouch either. If he played the whole year he'd potentially be the Hart favorite with his two way play.
He’s working on it
Get the fuck OUTTAH here with all this facts and data bulshit
"Except it sounds more like ""Fahk Brad Mahchand."""
"I MEANT “RECORD BREAKER” OOOOOOPS

Fair points
Can you explain to me what is worse? Hoping someone has a career ending injury or literally trying to give someone one?
Seems pretty straightforward when the injury he's upset about was caused intentionally by the person he's wishing harm on. 
So is brad Marchand 
What does the advanced hockey stats community have to say about this correlation?
I mean typically if you score a goal in OT your entire team wins. He isn't the franchise leader in OT wins. It's that fucking simple.
Wins are a completely separate stat from goals score if you haven't even realized. And no one ever talks about a skaters wins as a stat. Pretty fucking simple. 
 ^ this guy knows what's up
"No it doesn't. No one ever gives a fuck or mentions ""wins"" for a skater. He didn't become #1 in franchise OT wins he became #1 in OT Goals. I'm pretty sure someone like Chara has won more in OT than Marchand since he's been on the team longer. "
i feel that. marchand with the beauty finish
Larkin can’t even score a fucking goal. He is far from great
"And as per usual, you have nothing meaningful to contribute as to how the Red Wings can get better. We oh we oh Mr. PC happy police "
"It wasn't the words he was saying, it was the way he was saying them, in that sort of muffled-yell that he has. "
I was wondering about this... Where is St. Patrice? 
Reading all these comments makes me feel like Marchand himself is [repeatedly punching me](https://i.imgur.com/z2Cx7NG.mp4) in the face while I stand there doing nothing.
We really miss Marcus Johansson right now.
Is this becoming a thing because yay 
but does it count if you dont use the cube?
Your karma is at 63... I can't change it.

"you must of missed the 6 goals they gave up. Their offense for the most part can compete, their D is a hot mess."
"Of the lengthy list of teams Marchand has wronged, does any fanbase come even remotely close to the bitterness the Devils display on here?"
explain to me why people shouldn't be salty? 
"He is a good person. Just a dirty hockey player. I don't respect a lot of the stuff he has done to make himself considered a dirty player, but I respect the hell out of his off ice exploits. Plus he is a great hockey player. Just a great dirty hockey player."
"i was thinking Gionta, Wingels and Holden but yeah the Bonnafide Stallion as well."
"Bona, Fide, and Stallion"
"It'll just say ""Stallion"" on the jersey."
"Its possible  ,  if Rask wins a cup as a starter for the Bs then I would say he’s pretty much a lock"
"Tuukka. 

I mean Chara, Bergeron and Marchand already have a cup. But probably."
I would lose Marchand for an extended period of time 10 out of 10 times over Bergeron. 
Needs to work harder then
Had me confused 
Guess who the Bruins' OT wins leader is bud.
You’re kind of being a dick over semantics. You know what they meant. 
"He's still racking up assists though. He's also taken on the first line center role as a 21 years old. Maybe he'll never be a Crosby or McDavid level player, but he's the guy I want us to build our team around."
Yeah honestly I agree. Gonna be a long rebuild

Fractured foot. Reevaluating in one week
I will never get tired of watching this. 
You guys did crush us at home. 
"See now that's a comment I can sympathize with.

Most people with your flair are brash and outright over the line. When insulting Marchand, you have to get creative. Like get behind the scenes of what's going on and make it look like an accident, or try to go in one direction for most of the insult and then at the last second you turn and fire a misdirection at em' and knock em out."
Wishing injury on Marchand isn't bringing him back any sooner.

😂😂 jersey sucks
My point was they're severely underachieving. Coaching change might be coming when his contract is up or sooner. 
I didn't realize that was a thing
"As someone who doesn't watch much Bruins or Devils, how'd he do the Devils dirty?"
"Well to be fair, the Devils incident is the most recent so it does make sense that they'd be the saltiest."
The Canucks fans acted like he murdered every one of their dogs for a solid 5 years. 
"Well, the Devils were his most recent victim. It took me a while to get over the Sami Salo incident back in 2012 (and playing really well in a finals against us as a rookie doesn't help things). And this wasn't a one-off, this is a guy with a pretty long history of dirty play.

I don't care how great a player he is (and he is probably the best two-way winger in the world today); he's just never going to be likable.
"
"Well the fact is that he's been back on the ice for quite some time while MoJo is still seeing stars, so you will understand why Devils fans are salty. MoJo isn't a 4th line scrub, he's an important part of our resurgence. "
"Well we are the only team that currently has a player out from a dirty hit from that scumbag, so it makes sense we are the most bitter."
"I mean, he probably ended Johansson's career for literally no reason. On a nothing play where he just elbowed him in the head, for what? the fact that you bruins fans don't give a shit about players makes your opinions on Cooke irrelevant. At least Cooke injured people during the damn play, dirty or not. Marchand is much worse (and has been suspended longer IIRC?), and is a rat who does it behidn the play, and then runs behind Chara, who protects him because he's a classless pos like the rest of your shit team. "
"Y'all have every reason to be upset. It's just funny when it's ~~completely out of nowhere like this~~ on every post about him regardless of context.

~edit, changed wording to work better with my point."
About this game and Marchand's hat trick?  Because he didn't do anything except be ELITE. 
I was really hoping Bels would get up there too.
No Sweeney? Just because we can
"GIonta on the Bs is pretty much fulfilling a childhood dream of mine, so I’m surprisingly ok with this. "
He is. How many suspensions/fines/incidents has he had since Johansson? Logically can’t judge a player changing on their past incidents. We’ll reset the timer when he fucks up again next year.
"Oh yeah, a ~50 point player who can’t crack 10 goals in 82 games is a guy you want to build around? I’m sure as shit glad you’re not GM"

"Oh man, hope he will be back soon! I want him to be the playoff monster he can be!"
you can also call him a milk drinker 
Where did I do that?
Downvote me if you are a Devils fan.
Downvote this post if you think Bruins fans are losers.
See you in the playoffs kiddo.
"they are in no way severely underachieving. not even slightly underachieving. We are better than last year IMO, but we are pretty much where everyone expected us to be, bottom 5-10 in the league. Our Captain is 37, Kronwall has no knees, and all the production from this team is basically coming from 20 year olds. no way a coaching change would significantly improve our standing THIS season. I don't particularly care for Blashill, but with this roster, again with this D core, I'm not sure what more the best coach in the world could do."
He tagged Marcus Johannson on the button with a diving elbow during a net drive. He was suspended for it.
"Cheapshotted Mojo in the back of the head with an elbow, Mojo has been out for 20+ games with a concussion."
"To be fair, we did win that SCF in '11 against the Cunucks, in their home arena no less, so they already hated Boston for that."
He’s plenty likable though. 
"http://www.nj.com/devils/index.ssf/2018/02/why_devils_remain_hopeful_marcus_johansson_will_re.html

Look, was Marchand did was shit but being overdramatic about it helps nobody. He'll hopefully be back by the end of the season, not 'he'll probably never play again'. "
"Aww look, the flairless coward is upset.

How cute."
Flair up or shut up 
"This shit team is currently the hottest team in hockey 😂😂. Come back when they’re bad, maybe we’ll hear it "
"but it's not completely out of no where. it's out of brad marchand throwing a completely unnecessary and dirty elbow, potentially ending the career of a 27 year old guy. 

stop acting like it's something new for dirty players to be hated, people root against players who aren't good enough to play clean, it's always been that way. "
"I know it’s gonna be hard to decide whether or not his number goes up in Boston, Anaheim or New York"
"Yeah, Swoop deserves it."
Going 6 weeks without an incident isn't impressive and is not enough time to suggest anything has changed knowing his history.
"He scored 23 and 17 goals his first two seasons, and is on pace to crack 10 goals and 60 points this season. He's also second on our team in Corsi For and Relative Corsi For. And again, he's 21, he's going to keep improving.

Besides numbers, have you actually watched any Wings games this year? He plays a complete 200 foot game and does a good job controlling the play, which is extremely important for a center."
You kiss your mother with that mouth? 
You can be a great player and also a douchebag. The two aren't mutually exclusive. See Sidney Crosby. 
"I wanna upvote this comment, but don't wanna ruin it lol"
I mean he is a great player but a great player can also be a piece of shit.
I pray every night to get the Devils in the first round. I'm already searching online for the best type of broom.
😂😂😂 right good luck with that
Get your young guys to actually play. and a just little defense would go a long way. 
"He could be a fan of any team, everyone that isnt a Total Masshole hates Marchand...also Marky Mark is a shit actor"
"I'm not saying it wasn't out of nowhere. There was no reason to elbow MoJo. But at the same time, there's no reason to bring it up in every thread about him. That's salt. Few other people in this thread are bringing up their grievances with Marchy, and just celebrating the fact that he IS good enough to play clean. He's one of the best goal scorers in the league (on pace for 105 in 82gp), it's just a matter of how he was brought into the league. He's a product of the late 2000 Bruins, who played heavy and hard and dirty. He hasn't fully Marched his way out of that style yet, although he's working on it, and he's certainly been better."
"New York is a lock at this point.

Also, I have you tagged as ""Will get Sweeney's Wild Ride tattoo if Bruins win the Cup"". I've got my eye on you."
"Okay so what do you want him to do realistically? I know 6 weeks isn't enough time, but he's going out and playing hard without being dirty. Is he supposed to hug every player after every shift? Yeah he has a shit history as a shithead player, the only way he can change it is over time. It isn't possible that he will immediately be a clean player. ""He needs to work harder then"" makes zero sense."
"See Corey Perry, Ryan Kesler"
"Holy ol’fack Nova Scotia! Apparently they love churning out talented asshole scum bags, they need to learn to raise their kids with some manners! I say we all agree it’s Nova Scotia‘a fault."
"Sid can be a shitty dude sometimes but he's not a legit bad person like Marchand.

And I won't argue that the guy is good at hockey but his tendencies are holding him back so much more than they are helping him."
"are you really comparing brad marchand and sidney crosby?

because a) marchand isnt' even in the same league in terms of skill and b) crosby isn't even the same league in terms of guys who should have both their knees blown out next game"
"RemindMe! June 1, 2018"
"I mean, we outplayed you in our last 2 games in every stat but goals... we outshot you by almost 30 total shots.

You guys barely won both games lol.

But hey we'll see."
"yeah Daley has certainly helped on D. The problem is we had about 12 D mean come through the system over the last 5 years, and literally all of them have been crap. Our young guys have gotten minutes this season, and Larkin though his goals are down, has really improved his overall play this season, he is out next captain (or should be). Mantha will always score, but as you see on the OT goal, his defense is SHITE. Frk is nothing more than a 3rd liner imo, and for me Lil Tuzzi the verdict is still out, the injury really hurt his progression this year. Next year we will see at least 3 more youngsters come up probably, Hornek, Rasmussen, and Sevchenko. Depending on the pick in the lottery we could see a 4th player as well. "
Lots of bruins fans up here in Canada 
"He literally just ended a dudes career, how is he “getting better”...?"
Touche
They need to learn some true Canadian manners
"What makes you say Marchand is a “legit bad person”? All that [money he gives to charity](https://www.noticeability.org/foxsports-bruins-brad-marchand-pitches-in-for-dyslexia-charity/)? Or was it that one time he [sent a family to the ASG](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nesn.com/2016/02/brad-marchand-sent-family-on-all-expense-paid-trip-to-nhl-all-star-game/amp/)? 

I think saying anyone is a [legit bad person](http://abc7ny.com/sports/no-charges-against-ex-devils-player-now-coach-accused-of-assaulting-player/473076/) purely for their on-ice exploits when they’ve done nothing bad off the ice is *just a tad* harsh."
"Sid has speared dudes in the nuts, slew footed guys, taken cheap shots, made dirty hits, dives, and cries harder than anyone in the league. How is that any different? The only difference is he's the face of the league so he doesn't get suspended. I would agree that his bullshit sucks and needs to stop. He is arguably the most skilled player on our team and when he misses games for bullshit moves, it hurts the team. He is a top talent in the league and he needs to grow up. "
"Didn't they play on the *same line* for Canada  in the 2016 WCOH? That's about as close to ""ballpark"" as you get."
Crosby has 70 points this season and Marchand has 66 after missing 5 games. Seems like their leagues aren't too far off from one another. 
"First of all, love Marchand's game, but hate his dirty shit.  Second of all, Crosby is certainly close to as dirty (slew foots, spears dudes in the nuts, take cheap shots) and he also cries way harder than anyone in the league.  Marchand is definitely not the best player in the league like Sid argurably is, but he also isn't nearly as whiney and bitchy.  He also doesn't get away with it because he isn't the face of the league.  I'm not a Marchand defender, he deserves all the hate, criticism, suspensions, and diving/non-calls against him.  But if you are arguing that Sidney Crosby is not dirty, then you are wrong. "
Hit me up. We'll let you guys know what playing hockey in June feels like.
"Lol last I checked that “goals” stat you mentioned is the only one that matters in the end. But whatever, justify your losses however you want"
It would be fun but Tampa refuses to lose. So I doubt it's going to happen.
"Back in 2012 he was slew footing or spearing guys every other game. He was simply on the ice to try and take people out. Now he has one really bad play and maybe a controversial play a year. Last year was the spear on Dotchin, this year the Elbow on MoJo. And that's why I say he hasn't fully overcome that old style of play. He still is a piece of shit sometimes, but I'd call a PoS twice a season Marchy ""getting better"" compared to a PoS twice a week Marchy.

It's amazing what you can be lead to believe when you only see highlights of a guy from 3 games he plays all season, isn't it?"
Well plus they are both in the National Hockey **League**
"In my 28 years of life the Devils have only missed 7 playoffs... The exact same number as the Bruins.

In that same time frame we've won all 3 series against you guys lol."
"Ya, almost like he’s getting less frequent, more calculated/violent."
"And we've won the Cup in a year after a Bush was president. (Nice cherry picking on the years there, as well. I will grant NJ won one more cup since Devil's inception. Brodeur was awesome.)"
ROASTED. HAHAHAHA!
Don't really see how any of that's relevant to this season. The Devils have definitely been the more successful franchise the past 28 years. So what?
Ahh so he's trained in the arts of a military sniper now...I seeee...
"To be fair, that wasn't me cherry picking, the dude just told me that he would tell me about playing hockey in June which is something I personally am very familiar with.

I have no idea how people were able to stomach being Devils fans in the 80s lol."
"> Hit me up. We'll let you guys know what playing hockey in June feels like.

> The Devils have definitely been the more successful franchise the past 28 years. So what?

Yeesh."
"Doesn’t take military training to realize that the random acts of stick violence and slue footing is too obvious and to be more rat faced about it. Completely disregard the fact that someone has lost their livelihood, but frequency has gone down slightly so everything is ok then I guess.
In 2012 he intentionally injured players every chance he got and here in 2018 that’s obviously still the case, but he’s on pace for 100 points so he’s an awesome guy.
People like you are the fucking worst. "
Holy fuck you guys are stupid.
"> It's amazing what you can be lead to believe when you only see highlights of a guy from 3 games he plays all season, isn't it?

Just gonna leave that here 
"
Well said.
"This year also known as the ""I only won this award because Dahlén is 12 days too old to be eligible"" award."
Why didn't they award it in 2017?
"The best choice in my opinion but there have been a few juniors in Allsvenskan that has been better, like Vegas prospect [Lukas Elvenes](http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=290074) who had twice the points per game of [Olofsson](http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=316535), but was recalled to his SHL team halfway through the season. "
"I hope he gets faster, I worry it could hold him back at the next level. His vision is outstanding though"
That and Elvenes got recalled.

"Does the streak end at the end of the regular season? Does it continue into playoffs?

i hope he is a good presence in the locker room, i had heard he was fairly stuck up over in edmonton, but that was only rumours.

The Oilers should try to trade for him. I think he'd fit in well with them. 
The crazy stat is that every single one of those streaks was stopped by Hellebuyck.

"i dont know... that Guy guy seems pretty weak... like only on there once...

Holy shit. This *IS* oddly reminiscent of the strikeout threads for Judge this past year...
"Goddamn. Imagine an Oiler fan was also a huge Taylor Hall fan and thought they could enter one of these fucking threads excited to be happy for the guy?


Nah, fuck that. Circle jerk it to death. Bashing Edmonton is more important than celebrating the successes of *your* star player."
A video game thinks that trade is moronic and won’t do it. Just fuck my life. Get Chia out of here before he trades McDavid and Rogers place to the Flames for Brouwer. 
Personally I believe Hall is only playing this good because of the trade. That trade sent him a wake up call and drove him to be this good. You can circle jerk about Edmonton management all you want but Hall would have never reached these heights in Edmonton. And that's not just on the Oilers it was Hall too. Sometimes a change of scenery and the realization that you can't just get by on past accomplishments and raw talent is needed to be a better player. I believe the same was true for Tyler Seguin. In the end the trade was beneficial for the Oilers and really beneficial for the Devils.

I fail to see your point
"Makes me curious how many guys hit streaks of between 20 and 25 games, since they kinda arbitrarily chose 26 for this cutoff"
HallofFame?
"Its consecutive appearances, not games (since he did miss a couple to injury early in the streak). So I think it would continue through playoffs/next year?"
Was it worth adding the up
Low hanging fruit. I award you no points.
Gonna go on a limb here and say he’s not for trade 
And yet I disagree.
I thought our fanbase was supposed to be the one making everything about our team?
Who? Hutchinsons backup?
Didn't you trade Hall so you could sign Milan Lucic?
"Nah, that was Eberle (kinda)"
OOOOOHHHHHHHHHhhhhhh
"Is ""riot"" the word you were looking for?"
"You do know the Caps, Blues, Sharks, and the Cannucks won a game in the 3rd round more recently than the Wild right?"
"glass houses, buddy"
"Canucks got like 20+ cups according to all of my EA NHL franchise modes. 

Don't know what you're trying to do here lol"
Pretty sure anyone alive for those cups is so old they’ve got one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. 
"I agree. I would take a bullet for Sundin. He was my favourite as a kid. But he's easily the odd one out of the group of players listed above.

"
"Kane will probably end his career on top, youre right. "
Aaron Judge now has a reddit thread in 300 consecutive days.

"I feel the same way tbh but it's not just devils fans doing it lol.

Every hockey fan of all shapes and colors comes out to bash Edmonton when a Taylor Hall post shows up and there are like 2 comments about how good he actually is lol."
And they feel personally attacked when you point out the circlejerk. 
"You realize people crap on Edmonton so much this season is because you have McDavid and Draisaitl and you're not even close to the playoffs? After all of the Oilers hype going into this year, it was inevitable that Edmonton bashing would happen after this tire fire."
"In other news, PK Subban is going great in Nashville."
"> *Bashing Edmonton is more important than celebrating the successes of your star player.*  
  
/r/hockey isn't *predominantly New Jersey Devils fans*.  There's plenty of trash talk here.  But it's from pretty much anybody.  Not especially New Jersey, by any means.  
  
Folks like trash-talking in hockey.  Nobody can reasonably expect to be ""safe"" from exposure to trash-talking on a hockey board.  
  
And all the individual you're responding to pointed out is the literal content of the trade itself.  As an individual whose team came out on the winning end of it.  I think a team's allowed to celebrate a trade.  Even if the reciprocal and inherent effect of it was their opponent losing the trade.  
  
""It's mean to mention a trade you won in a thread about the performance of the trade's biggest asset, if I might feel bad about being on the losing side of it"" doesn't seem like a reasonable demand to me, on a sports board.  "
This is just a fraction of what Operation Regicide felt like. Oilers fans were on the front line of that bullshit. Honestly glad Oilers fans are on the pointy end of the stick now. You reap what you sow.
"A video game also thinks that me offering a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 2 roster players for an 88 OA player was idiotic...so that doesn't really matter lol"
"Even with how good he's doing this year it's only his 3rd best season of P/60. So you can say it's only cause of this trade, but he was this exact player and at times better in Edmonton. "
"I think it's also because this really is *his* team. In Edmonton they got so many #1 picks that it was always about the next best thing. Even in his second year, it's very obvious that he's the guy for the Devils."
"As far as Hall is concerned, that's a bit, um, narrative-y. From 2011 till when he got injured in 2015, he was one of the top scoring wingers in the entire league. Not his fault the team had next to no good defencemen."
"Taylor Hall had a better pp/60 in his 80 pt season in Edmonton then he has now this season. He just flew under the radar because the team was so terrible.

This isn't shocking, Hall did this in Edmonton already. "
"Well, if youre being serious, Edmonton traded a literal superstar in Taylor Hall (whose achievements are up there with GOATs) for Adam Larsson, a very solid top 4 D

I love me some Eagle, but god damn Chia fucked up"
well they chose 26 cause thats where the current one stands
"Not many to be honest.

It was big news when Hall hit 20 and at that point it was already the longest streak this season by any player."
"As a Jets fan since 1988-89, I've waited almost 30 years for a season where the Jets are contenders and the Oilers are not. I'm taking all the shots I can get in. "
Yeah true a player like Hall is one you'd want to keep. You'd have to be crazy to trade him. 
How does Matthews feel about Hall's point streak?
... oh god we did.

"True, but OP is right that Patrick Kane doesn't even lift."
I mean career PPG Player with 564 Career goals over 1300 games played is still pretty damn good.
Where's Sundin's Hart? His Art Ross? His first team all star selection? Mats Sundin is the worst player in that group by a mile.
"/r/hockey comes out to bash the Oilers in EVERY thread, regardless who or what it’s about. That’s one horse that’s been beaten to a pulp. "
"the edmonton oilers deserve every ounce of shit getting dumped on them, the poor fans are just collateral damage "
It was more or less Hall's team until McDavid was drafted.
Again i fail to see your point? I support the trade completely. I strongly dislike Hall as a human being and am glad he is off the Oilers. His recent comments just add to the fire that he was hard to work with.
"Right but when he was at 24 people were like “if he gets to 26 he’ll join Gretzky/Kane/whoever”, which made me wonder if there were significantly more players or significantly less talented players who’d had streaks up to 25 "
I was born in 95 so I've only known bad Oilers teams!

They're gasping for air in the chirp department this season
"They made the finals in 98 (therefore won a game in the ECF)

Wild made the WCF once in their history and scored 1 goal against Giguere in a 4 game sweep in 03.

Caps won  game in the 3rd round more recently than the wild confirmed"
"Pretty damn good is lacking in a stack of all time greats. The guys you're comparing him to are the 1 and 1a players of all time, the second best offensive defenseman of all time, the greatest two way forward of all time, the best scoring winger of the 70s and the best scoring winger of the 2010s."
"Kane has only played half the games though. Dont get me wrong, I think Kane will finish his carerr as a HHoF and solidly better than Sundin, but he's only halfway through his career.

I think Sundin is vastly overrated in general, but he did put up a ppg for like 1400 games on a team that couldnt find their ass with both hands. "
"You do you bud, have fun in cap hell"
"Support the trade? How blind can you be? You guys traded a top 5 LW for an at best top 4 dman. Having the ability to mix and match Draisaitl/Hall on the wings of McDavid/RNH would ignite that offense and you guys would not be on the outside looking in. Dislike the guy all you want but he'd make your team so much better, and you wouldn't have Lucic's horrendous contract. "
Hate to break it to ya bud. But a lot of hockey players are assholes. Also I don’t really think we’re in a position to be saying “well atleast we have character” when we’re in year whoknowsanymore of being embarrassing.
"Go to bed, Doreen. "
I was born in 1983 and I've only known bad Jets teams. 😐
none of us float down here.
"lol, yes. But it was more of a caps can’t make it out of the 2nd round joke"
"So why is Patrick Kane ""the weakest member of the group"" when it's obviously Sundin? You have to remember that for most of Sundin's tenure in Toronto, the Leafs were good. And as for the ""Sundin never had any good wingers"" argument, that's true if you ignore Wendel Clark, Dave Andreychuk, Gary Roberts and Alex Mogilny. One of those guys was one of his wingers for all but three of Sundin's seasons in Toronto."
"Because Kane is the only one there that hasn't made the HHoF yet? Assuming he doesnt fall of a cliff production wise he will make it easily but its not a personal attack or anything.

I also feel that list of names is pretty weak as compared to everyone else's supporting cast..."
"Kane hasn't made the Hall of Fame, it's true, but Sundin's career is over and we know for a fact that he wasn't a first team all star, he never led the league in goals, assists, or points, he never won the Hart, he never won the Conn Smythe, and he never won the Stanley Cup. You can say at least three of those things about everyone else on that list substituting Norris for Hart in Coffey's case except for one, Mats Sundin, who you can say literally none of those things about. The point is, even if Kane's career isn't over, he's already accomplished more than Sundin."
"Jose theodore won a Hart and no one thinks hes better than Luongo.

Its not a personal attack, man. Kane is a phenominal player but his career isnt over with, thats all I am saying. "
"No, you're saying is that Sundin is better than Kane. I want you to make that case. I want you to make the case that Mats Sundin is better than Patrick Kane. I want you to say that the player who has never been a first team all star, has never won the Hart, has never won the Art Ross or ever come particularly close to any of those things is better than the player who has. Patrick Kane could have the rest of his career derailed by a meth addiction and he'd still be better overall than Mats Sundin."
"You realize this isnt a personal attack or anything, right? "
"I realize you said Mats Sundin was better than Patrick Kane. So defend that position, why is Mats Sundin better than Patrick Kane?"
"Because Mats Sundin played 1400 games and averaged a ppg? To me thats more valuable than what Kane has done. 1400 games is rare, let alone a ppg for the duration. 

And that if Kane keeps up with his current pace he'll pass him in my mind but I am not gonna give him credit for stuff he hasnt done. "
"Okay, got it. Using that logic, I can safely assume that you also believe that Joe Mullen is better than Evgeni Malkin."
"Eh, Mullen played like 1k games, didnt he? There is certainly a big difference. Thete have been like 40 people hit the 1400 mark, 1k is far more common."
"What a game. As a hockey fan I absolutely loved it. As a Dallas fan, I'm still pretty happy with their play. 

One of the best low scoring games I have seen. 

Nashville fans, what's it like to see Rinne every game?   Holy crap. "

Lehtonen was the better goalie tonight. Rinne wasn’t tested nearly as much. Only giving up one goal was amazing for Kari.

Honestly agreed. Especially considering he played two thirds of a game the night before. 
"He was Nashville before Nashville was even competitive. People always talk about someone being ""deserving"" of a Cup but nobody ever mentions this guy. Carried the team on his shoulders for years and then they finally get a bunch of real talent and load up around him and suddenly people are surprised that Nashville is a challenger. It's been such a treat to watch. "

"It irks me when I see Pens fans say this because:

1. Many of the goals against you were great shots that he had no chance on, undercutting his quality.

2. Many of the goals yall scored on him were amazing after withstanding incredible NSH offensive shifts (shotless for 35+ minutes then a shot and goal directly afterwards?!) and saying that it was on shitty goaltending undercuts the quality of PIT."

Yes
Can he play center
I believe he is the most NHL ready forward in that draft. Let’s just pray we can get either him or Dahlin. 
"The second he comes out of the draft he'll be instantly ready to play his first NHL game, right there in that arena. "
I’ll just be happy when his brother is NHL ready
"Yes, he's still the 2nd best player in the draft and got the size and muscle to survive in the NHL. 

The top 3 in the draft are all better and more NHL ready than Hischier was last year. (Not a slight to him, he's a great player but these three are great prospects.)"
Interested to see the responses. This is a good draft for us given the holes in our roster. 
Think he's one of the best forwards in the draft and will probs get drafted a head of Zadina. But if he gets hurt again then We could see him fall after Zadina in the draft.
"Svech's got an excellent stat now, but Yakupov also had perfect numbers before 2012 draft. Hope he will rule from the first shift for the new club"
"He's not as good as Zadina, and Zadina is definitely ready. I'd say yes. "
CM PUNK! CM PUNK! CM PUNK!
/ thread
Why couldn't his brother be NHL ready...
as well as Johnathan Drouin!
"Is he still that far ahead of Zadina? It was my understanding that Zadina had roared up the draft rankings while Svechnikov had really cooled off.

Honestly just asking. I’d love to hear what everyone thinks about those 2"

You motherfuckers don’t need any more good players you just need a coach to coach those good players. 
"You’re getting a lot of wise ass answers, but it’s true. The top 10 is basically defensemen and wingers, either of which the Oilers could really use in the next couple years. "
Yakupov played first year out of draft too. Was on pace for almost 30 goals as a rookie if it wasn't short season! 
"Oh hey I can be biased too! But I won't, because that's not the point of this thread"
This is a wierd statement. What does zadina being ready matter if he's worse then him.
"If his brother was NHL ready, the Wings couldn't have drafted him"
"Svechnikov was our for 17 games with a hand injury and it looked like he was still recovering in the world juniors, but I believe since then he’s been hot. He’s also bigger, and faster, which is what you need for an easier transition to the big leagues. 

All that being said I’d be pretty content having Zadina on my squad next year too. "
"Svechnikov is still well beyond Filip Zadina, in my opinion. But Zadina has solidified himself as a the third best skater now.

Svechnikov missed time with a hand injury (not good for a sniper) yet is sitting at 34 goals in 38 games on a team that’s not really the hottest in terms of offensive talent — albeit they did add Aaron Luchuk and Dmitri Sokolov. He’s at 0.89 goals per game, which is quite nice for a guy in his first OHL season. He isn’t quite as good of a 2-way forward like Zadina, but an elite potential sniper is more valuable to a team picking 2nd overall. He’s also very good at skating and has a nice, pro-ready frame (6’3”, 187 lb). 

No disrespect to Zadina, but Svech is on another, slightly higher level right now as a prospect. If a team doesn’t take him 2nd, they’ve made a mistake."
"He outproduces him in terms of primary points%

Svechnikov was also injured and plays in a lower scoring league. "
"Zadina still has some flaws in his game. Sometimes tries to do too much on his own, defensive problems, etc.

I'd be shocked if he's in the NHL next season."
"And... surprisingly Bobby Ryan too, but I’m not concerned about that he’ll get his 10th hand injury in the next few games. "
He will look great in red and white. Hope you like our prospect pool
"I hope so, got to see him play quite a bit in Cape Breton. Too bad injuries set him back a bit."
Oh look who's been called up
And a GM to not trade those good players.
"We need good players. People somehow have this belief that McDavid, Drai and the Nuge can carry us to the promise land. Last season was the worst thing to happen for us because we still had a lot holes that needed to be filled. People ignored that because we were winning with players who overachieved. 

**EDIT:** As usual people don't like the truth."
I mean I expect the wise ass answers because I am an Oilers fan but you are right this is the draft for us. On the other hand it's a terrible draft for MTL.
"And btw it was his best season (12/13), since he never scored more than 17 goals"
"No, but the point of the thread was to ask if Schev will be NHL ready. I answered the question. "
I knew this would be the first comment. I just want dual svec bros
"He had 7 points in 7 games on the 3rd line of a Russian team that disappointed. 

If he was recovering still, that can only tell you how he would have been in full condition"
I think Bobby just needs to get bionic hands at this point.
"Yeah, because if he decides to go to a contender what better team than the Red Wings. Is it suddenly 2002 again?"
He’s bigger too which is everything the Wings need. Size is something we’ve been lacking for years
Oh lord. That’ll never happen. 
True you guys have Lucic who’s doing nothing. Hopefully there’s something in the minors for you guys. 
Not if we get Dahlin. He's left defense.
Edmonton will do that to a players development
"You went out of your way to say zadina is better, which is wrong. "
"While we definitely need Dahlin more, having both Svechnikov brothers would not be a bad consolation prize"
"It's a risky operation, but it'll be worth it. "
https://imgur.com/a/Rmhl6
Can’t a boy dream? I can say we’d give him the entire state of Michigan and Windsor if we ever gave him a contract. Detroit is desperate for our next Swedish savior lol. And to be clear the only way I think he gets moved to Detroit is if it’s Mantha a prospect and 3 draft picks. 
Was Detroit not a contender the year they won the cup or went to the finals in 08/09?
"I was super impressed with Mantha last time the leafs played you guys, moves really well for a big body."
Ya we have some interesting prospects in the minors but they are a few years away. 
I'd be very surprised if we get either.
Hopefully the surgeon doesn’t have bobby hands. 
"Yeeeeeeeees sir! 2002 just came to mind first. You know, one of the greatest rosters of all time?"
If only he could play defense and use his body like he should be able to. Given two years and he could be the best player on the Wings. He still has to contend with Larkin though and that boy can play 200 feet of hockey and has been a whole new animal this year

Probably Miles Wood.  Kid looks like Dave Franco
Seguin ain’t tied down. 
Willy Nylander... Not even close
Hartm.... :( 
"Fisher - married  
Josi - engaged  
Smith?  
Hartman?  
Subban?  
Jarnkrok?

Probably Hartman now, but our hotness/60 might be leading the league"
"Wild Bill!

In about 18 years there is going to be a huge crop of beautiful blonde draft picks coming out of Vegas"
Brayden Point 
Olli Maatta is the only player on the Pens without a gf. Sad. 
"If you're an Anaheim fan and you don't say Uncle Rico...

Klefbom probably 
DJ MDZ
I don't think Skinner has a gf
Robert Hagg
"Dubois. He mentioned in a Carpool video with Nick that he's single. Every girl loves a big boy. Hell, I love big boys. So thicc"
Sidney Crosby.
Lindholm's a pretty handsome cat.
Johnny Hockey 
"Charlie McAvoy, David Pastrnak, or Jake DeBrusk. No homo. "
HARTMAN
"McDavid, once he's old enough to date of course"
"Probably /r/hockey's favorite Cap, Tom Wilson. Though he does have a girlfriend. So maybe Burakovsky? "
Tyler Johnson is still single last I checked. He's popular with the ladies. Or Brayden Point.
Brendan Gallagher. 
I heard grand-daddy Ekblad is still single. Mmm that beard... 
Brockstar
Travis Konecny
"I don't watch The Bachelor, so I have no idea."
Alex Galchenyuk
Timo gets my vote. 
"William Karlsson, but I think he has a girlfriend."
I'd say Panarin 
"That's really hard...  
It used to be easy when it was only Skinner, but now we have him, Lindholm, TVR, and the ladies are super into our prospect Roland McKeown "
Laine
"Alex Tuch, I think he's single??"
Has to be Pastrnak
Alex “run a train on your woman” Galchenyuk 
"For the Rangers, it's gotta be Brady Skeji. That beautiful Disney prince man..."
"Connor Fuckin' Hellebuyck, to be sure!"
Brad Marchand.
"Is Landeskog single? If so, him."
"fuck, im gay now"
Definitely Mr Olli
he recently got engaged...idk how...
"Wow, look at the personality on that guy."
And has a pornstar's name.
[The ultimate bachelor](https://imgur.com/JE04EzJ) 
"He looks like one of those people who passes as well adjusted in society but is secretly a psychotic killer.

Just sayin'

That or Superman."
Hall is available though
He was DFW's most eligible bachelor in some magazine a few years back. 
"Didn’t a bunch of teenage girls come up to him, Matthews, and Hyman and only want Nylander’s picture cause they were in love with him. Think it was in 24/7. "
"Willy is a beut, I know lou's rules but I miss that flow"
He's one of those guys that you either think is really attractive or weird looking. Kinda like Adam Driver
"Pretty sure he's also one of the only single guy. Maybe Hyman, Leivo and Freddy are also single."
"y u do this? 

I do think he has a girlfriend though because I remember being irrationally annoyed that he was skating with someone at the holiday party that was documented on Snapchat. "
"No Rinne? 

He was engaged at one time, but I think that's off now last I heard."
Subban is for sure single. I always see him at the bars spittin that PK Fire (s/o Ness)  
Hartman has a long time SO. 
No fiala? 
There's a lot of girls that like a good looking white dude in Vegas.  He won't last the off-season unless he goes back to Sweden.
"21 upbolts, appropriate "
"Maatta is married to the game, and by game I mean getting stone cold shit hammered on Natty Lights in the middle of the day and passing out on lawn furniture."
Isn't Guentzel single?
[He has Drai now](https://streamable.com/0qioi)

Pretty sure he has a girlfriend. I mean how could he not?
"Not Brock?

Do guys with girlfriends count as bachelors?"
philadelphia does not miss him lol 
"There's also Lindholm, TVR, and the ladies are super into Roland McKeown

Have you seen him in his underwear? HOLY SMOKES.
He has a girlfriend.
Nope. http://www.playersgf.com/2017/06/sidney-crosby-with-his-future-wife-and-girlfriend.html
He has been with his girlfriend for years. I think she shies away from the spot light because she has her own career (I think she is a model) and doesn't want to be famous for being Ms. Crosby. 
Underage I think 
"Debrusk has a gf she was in the stands for his first goal

McAvoy dates Mike Sullivan's daughter"
He and Smith find gf’s on the road I’m sure.  Here’s their last vacation: http://i.imgur.com/4LkrMLq.gif
"Mcdavid seems like the kind of guy who accidently agrees to get lunch with a girl, and then doesn't make eye contact or answers her questions with one word. "
"I still remember watching Jimmy Kimmel interview some rocket who said her biggest life accomplishment was sleeping with Johnson.

So yea, buddy's got game"
Nah I follow him on Instagram. He’s got a girlfriend. 
I think Timo has a chica. I'd say Joner
It might be Kane now
"So, specifically not William Karlsson then."
"he’s been with Oleg Znarok’s daughter a long time, lol. I’m sure that’s never been awkward."
"And with that beard? It's kinda hard to believe, baby! I think he might have a gf tho.."
"He has a wife and kid. Shocking, I know.

I was gonna say Charlie McAvoy for the Bruins. I mean, who wouldn't want to ride a stallion?"
Really? Girls dig that rodent on skates?
"i believe he’s engaged, some Denver home magazine did an article about his place; they showed his dog and fiancée in a few photos. (don’t ask how i know this)"

Anything is possible!"
So was Benn. He has a gf now but technically still eligible
since 2004 I although think it was in 24/7
"Those rules are just dumb. But I'm not worried, that backwards generation is almost out the door for good."
Nylander looks like fuckin Hermey the elf from Rudolph the red nosed reindeer. 
"I mean this might prove your point, but how can you even compare Adam Driver to Willy? I've never heard anyway say he's even decently attractive, are there people who think that?"
same I don't get it at all
I think hyman is engaged now
I thought Freddy had a girlfriend.
"I'm not sure who's even married anymore outside of Seabrook and Sharp, but most of them seem to have girlfriends at those things. Maybe Hayden gets the prize when he gets back from Rockford."
[How could I forget about him?](https://imgur.com/a/TGGuY)
Ooohhh... a Super Smash Bros reference?  A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
"I can’t go into major details about this but he isn’t single. He had a puck bunny in Vancouver and he told her he had started seeing someone so next time he was in town, they couldn’t get together"
Everyone knows about Fiala’s girlfriend’s instagram 
"yea, no beautiful girls in sweden whatsoever "
"He has a rumored girlfriend, I think."
Think he's referring to [this](https://youtu.be/gibqm-84xBE) 
"TVR has a girlfriend I think. Think he said something about it in the Valentine's Day ""Ask the Canes"" thing."
"I'll have one of each, please.  "
Looks like a GQ cover model
Pierre doesn't count. 
Is it just me or is this site super creepy...
"Were talkin' Mountain Dews, brotha!"
Didn't realize that she was Sullivan's daughter lol
And then shuts up entirely once he realizes he's on a date.
"Haha...yeah, that's what I was referring to with that. The chick actually claimed she was cheating on Bishop (her supposed bf) with Johnson. DRAAAAAAAMA"
"does he?? most of his social media is him out to dinner with his boys. i fucked up, i really thought he was our main single dude. dillon? "
Kane has a girlfriend. He talked about how he had to pack up and say goodbye to his dog and girlfriend in Buffalo in an interview.
"Well, what are we considering a bachelor here? Not married or not single?"
"Oh damn, I did not know that haha that's pretty hilarious "
"This kid's fucking jacked. Thick, dense, built whatever you wanna call him he's got it. Legs thicker than my chest, and shoulders wider than my wingspan. Making full use of his frame and with the golden flow to top it off. He dwarfed us all. Bonafide stallion"

Just because there is a goalie doesn't mean you can't score.
what
"I think the rules were good for setting a new culture, a professional one. Made sure things were taken seriously and that we're becoming the real deal"
Holy shit 😂
"Oh yeah, I've never heard a guy say he's a good looking dude but I know plenty of girls that are crazy for him. But that may just be because they're attracted to the bad guys. Either way, a lot of people think he's just goofy looking but there are others that think he's hot shit. I think Nylander is the more attractive out of the two but I still think there's something about him that looks weird."
Yeah now that you mention it I think he does. 
"Sometimes I'm like ""man if I met them sometime maybe I could be a hockey girlfriend"" and then I realize I'm a troll compared to these beauties they all end up with. 

It might be Schmaltz. He's quite the looker. Campus cutie Hayden would be in the running for sure though. "
Technically it’s an Earthbound reference.
"They put fish and josi, fiala is a big part of their hotness/60 "

Phil?
He sure likes a lot of pictures of girls on Instagram for a guy with a girlfriend 
"“Where would you rank him in the top 25?”

“25.”

Damn, that gets me every time"
I think Ben Hutton is the real answer
"I mean how can anyone resist him

Also, how has Francis not extended him yet?"
It’s super super creepy!  But it tells more about Crosby’s gf.
"The weird broken English makes it creepier

Thats gonna be awkward when Boston and Pittsburgh meet in the playoffs. 
Hmmmm. maybe not! Haha I could see it being Dilly
"Good point, but I would say given modern times  bachelor means single."
"Somebody else mentioned Dubois. I believe that GQ model Alexander Wennberg is dating some Swedish model. Maybe Jones and Anderson could be in the running... not sure on the status of either.

An absolute unit.

"I don’t know, maybe he doesn’t. TIL I am Jake Guentzel tho."
"Because he'll be an RFA, no rush. He'll do it during the offseason"
Nah it’s pretty creepy
"Well, then yeah, specifically not William Karlsson."
Is Werenski single? I mean he's a robot emotionally but he's definitely going to be making a looot of money soon 
"The question is, does he do it before or after signing his brother? (plz)"
Who is the runner up?
ooooooh good call
Ummmm. I have no clue. I’m just going to say Chance.

"15,625 days since their last Stanley Cup vs the 270 days since our last Stanley Cup"
A lot 
No
Yes 
"[This one was pretty nice](https://imgur.com/kjlxTp1)

Drove around Philly playing a rerun of the Super Bowl"
Nice
That’s what I suspected
Was that supposed to be the exact same picture? 
18 goals in the last 18 games 
"Only 1 hat-trick this season????

Sophomore slump."
Laine is pretty good at hockey
He really is the heir apparent to Ovi in terms of being a pure sniper.  Only 19 too.  Wait until he's 22 and has filled out a bit more... even more strength and a heavier shot. This guy is probably going to be potting 40-50 for the next decade.  WPG is looking good.
Hatrik Laine!
He is fucking rolling
"More than just all Jets goals, Laine scored *every* goal in that game"
He's playing 4D chess while everyone else is playing checkers. It just not even fair right now. 
The beard only makes him stronger! 
They don't call him Hatrik Laine for nothing.
[Laine is on a fucking tear](https://i.imgur.com/pMKdiC2.png)
Generational talent. Almost as many goals as Crosby as a teenager. 
I will trade you an amish fireplace and a brand new horse and buggie for him
How awesome is it that he has his parents and 20 family members as guests to the game because he gets a day off in New York the next day?
This is Laine's world and we are just living in it.
I love how all the assists are from different players. 
Laine em up bud
"Yeah, fuck off buddy we absolutely need more Laine clips. Fuckin every time this kid steps on the ice someone scores. kids fuckin dirt nasty man. Does fuckin matthews have 38 goals this season I dont fuckin think so bud. I'm fuckin tellin ya Patrik ""golden flow"" Laine is pottin 100 in '18 fuckin callin it right now. Clap bombs, fuck moms, wheel, snipe, and fuckin celly boys fuck

"
The beard only makes him stronger 
Nobody told Laine his goal scoring was unsustainable i guess
Clapping all kinds of moms
I like this guy
3 Goals on 4 shots.
I think every single one of his goals is posted to r/hockey. 
"Don't know if it's just me but it seems that Laine has been quietly excelling this year; I don't see very much content about him / his play in comparison to last year. To be fair though, he was getting a lot of attention for being a rookie sensation but what he's doing this year is still incredible. "
What the fuck
13 in his last 9
Trade him for Barkov! 
"Even if he doesn't improve his goal scoring pace from this, by the time he is 30 he is going to have over 500 goals easily.

That is if he doesn't get injured and plays full season after full season but still."
"I honestly think his shot is better than ovi by a significant margin, but ovis skating is better by a significant margin which compounds on his shooting because he has a much better ability to get open and create his own shots.  Laine doesn't get many shots in a game.  He just buries them at an impossible rate.  He's shooting 50% over ten games"
Stast is a huge part of it. Guys killing it. 
[oooooooo yeeeeee](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RYnFIRc0k6E)
selfish!
"everyong else is playing checkers, and I'm playing tic tac toe baby!"
1D checkers
"I'm not a fan of labeling many players 'generational', but if McDavid is this generation's Crosby, there's no doubt that Laine could be this generation's Ovechkin. I'm excited for the days in the future where we discuss if Laine is one of the top all time goal scorers, the way we are with Ovi now. Keep clapping bombs you goat faced bastard"
"His bday is April 19th, so he has almost 6 weeks to pass a lot of big names. He has 74, so needs 11 to catch Hawerchuck at 85 https://i.redd.it/fqzsa30rc5i01.jpg, but will likely pass Gretzky and Crosby."
Matthews is better (ask any Leafs fan) and even he’s not generational. Sorry. 
You must be Jokering. 
Pfft! What a ridiculous offer! There's no way in hell we'd ever consider that without at least one butter churn and a few strapped lads for the next barn raising.
"Obviously with a name like Hattrik Laine, how could it not be his world?"
I hope he puts an elastic on it for playoffs
18 goals in his last 18 games. 
Just wait and eventually he'll be able to score 4 goals with 3 shots. It's just a matter of time.
This season has been a blast at /r/WinnipegJets. We basically have daily upvote parties.
Shooting 50% over the last 10 games
3 in his last 1
Calm down Sickdayz
Well Barkov is the more valuable player in a vacuum.
"His shooting % overall is slightly above last year's rate.  I think he can bridge the skating to an extent. We'll see how things go, but agreed no one is going to maintain a 50% shooting rate."
on Laine's first goal you can see him making room for Laine to take all the time he needs
Read that in Troy Westwood's voice for some reason.
Fuck yeah!
"In terms of play style, I think Matthews is probably closer to being Crosby than McDavid is.  McDavid is a new breed.  "
That's the spirit. 
This guy does not represent us. Both are amazing at what they do well. Simple. 
"> ask any Leafs fan

Yup."
"Laine is a generational shooter, you can't even debate it now. He's already put himself in the company of players like Yzerman, Crosby, Gretzky, and Hawerchuk at 19. "
Cringe 
"> ask any Leafs fan

lol why would I do that"
"bruh, nice amish fireplaces aren't cheap. I really think you're getting a good deal out of this. "
Hoping you guys kill it in the playoffs but you do seem to have the next Ovechkin...
"I always knew the Jets we're good last year it just looked like defence and goaltending problems, kind of like the Islanders this year. So happy to see them doing well"
"Must be nice 😭😭 our last two games have been depressing as all fuck, and they were spread out so far I FORGET what those threads are like "
0 in the last 14 hours. slump?
Inside a vacuum? Sounds like they would both suck in a vacuum...
"Well obviously he isn't going to retire with a 50% shooting rate.  I just think that if they went clean shot vs clean shot, that that Laine would be better at that, but if the contest was getting clean shots in the first place, that ovi would win that"
The dude was always a few yards short of a field goal 
I read in Dick Vitale
"I agree, playing style-wise. As far as 'Next One' status is concerned, I would say McDavid is Crosby's successor"
"Yeah, Leafs fans got what they needed and the Jets went from drafting 6th to 2nd and got one of the best shooters in the draft. Leafs got an amazing centre who does everything at an elite level. No complaints from anyone in my book."
Jets fans are over it. Just so you know.
"No, he's scoring off the ice but the NHL doesn't track that stat yet. "
one of the best shooters in the league*
We are too. We both got what we needed. 
Yeah honestly both of us won the lottery in our own ways. Look at which 2 Canadian teams will be making the playoffs this year!
"Jesus Christ, Good on those Oregon senators for taking action and doing what's right"
">The Winterhawks were seeking to have their players considered amateur athletes and not employees, which would exempt the team from paying players minimum wage and preclude the players from worker protections such as workers’ compensation insurance and unemployment insurance benefits. 

Ahh but of course. And therein lies the problem with Junior, and College Hockey. They don't want to pay their players anything, so that they can make more of a profit themselves."
"Honestly, it's about time people are aware of these issues. I played juniors here in the states for one year, and suffered 4 concussions through the first half of the season (and since also diagnosed with OCD). I was with a billet family half the country away from home, and was told that I would either play (despite my own doctor providing the diagnoses and consequences of playing to the team repeatedly because they did not provide a doctor for me) or my contract would be terminated immediately and I would be responsible to return home myself. I wasn't even paid $300 a month. I know of a lot of other people from a bunch of different teams with stories similar to mine. Something needs to change."
"Sure, force the teams to pay the players. Then they'll raise ticket prices, fans will bitch and stop showing up. Then franchises will fold and give less kids an opportunity to have a career in hockey. Somehow this is a win-win scenario in the eyes of many hockey fans. Bring on the downvotes..."
"Honestly, of all places, Oregon is not the place to try this. Our elected officials are (generally) on the side worker's rights."
"> Something needs to change.

Nothing will sadly. Too many powerful people at the top will try to prevent this.

And you can damn well bet the NCAA will be all against this too."
"I don't get it either, people are seemingly cheering this as if it's good for hockey.  These teams don't rake in a ton of money and a decision like this is a quick way to make the WHL leave the state of Oregon entirely.  "
2 goal games in 4 of his last 5
I think Laine has figure this whole nhl thing out. He’s playing some all around outstanding hockey
HE’S SECOND TO ONLY OVI IN GOALS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
~50% shooting percentage now over 9 games.
"His shot is just ridiculous, god damn."
I’m literally out of ways to express my disbelief at this point.
"Laine's going MILF hunting tonight boys
"
"Unreal, I'm speechless. As a Finn this brings me so much joy"
The uglier his beard gets the better he gets 
New career high. 
pretty good for a third liner
Lundqvist may be King but Laine is a God. 
Holy shit! The goals are just coming in waves and he makes it look so easy!!!
"Ovi vs Laine is gonna be a fun Rocket Richard race to watch

EDIT: Don't want to count Geno out either."
Goin for the Pat-trick
What do you think his post-entry contract looks like? Going to hit 40 this year and has a legitimate chance at the rocket. 
"Oh Great Golden God above, please bless us with your Clap Bombs and Fucked Moms"
Laine is going to win the Rocket.
He’s gonna score the quietest 40 goals ever 
Patrick hattrick! Generational talent.
Fuck yeah we need more Laine clips
His wrist shots make me a happy person
"Laine scores just like i used to in NHL 13.

"
"Hats off to clapping guy whose look just says ""Oh, Laine scored again? Well alright, I appreciate that very much as a Jets fan. Thank you Patrick."" "
I wonder how much Laine and Matthews would push each other if they could just both stay healthy the whole season. We’re in for at least a decade of a real treat.

^Why ^am ^I ^mirroring ^to ^gfycat? ^Because ^work ^blocks ^streamables"
"That's the problem. The salary will be mainly decided by market value which is determined by the nhlpa. Laine can't take a discount, only way to discount is to keep the stats and hardware on the down low.

There's a reason he sat in that Little line for 40-50 games even though it didn't work at all ever. Of course they knew it doesn't work.

There's a reason he was dropped to second PP after like 11 goals in his first 14 games. "
“Pots” the oficial word of ppl who try 2 sound like they know hockey 
He got 2 assists in the 5th game too.
mans hot 
Tied with Malkin
"On paper it looks insane, and it kind of is, but when you watch the goals he scores and how fast and accurate his release is... it's not all that crazy."
Realistically that's going to come crashing down at any point now... But hopefully not before he hits 40.
Yea can anyone tell me where that even went? Lol. Somewhere short side is all I saw
He's only scoring so much so everyone has to see his beard on all the  highlights. 
"To think I was scared he wouldn't hit 30 this year, holy shit"
"Ovechkin averaging over 2min more ice time than patrik.. Meaning about 200minutes more for ovie on this season. Think if pat had as much time how many could he score because in 200min you'll get some oppoturnities.. Hope he just keeps getting better and better and gets lots of ice time next season.

"
Laine and God beard are pratically identical
What's a king to a god?
And whats a King to a God? 
Most likely Pan.
I think even Hank watching that replay was impressed.
In the post-game interview Henrik talked about how Laine disguises his wrist shot to look like he's going glove side and beats you blocker side. That was definitely on full display last night. Can't even be mad as a Rangers fan at that skill
Staal coming in hot too
Hatrick Laine 
10x1.5 million per but his mom is signed as a consultant for 7million a year 
I think it's in the $9M ballpark (give or take a half million) for 8 years. 
8.5 x 8
8x8 is most likely. 
It’s going to be *Humongous big*
I'm hoping for lower money with shorter term  similar to ehlers but I could be dreaming. 7.5x6 would be nice 
"6 - 6.5 scaling up to 8 x 8

That'd be my guess"
At this rate? Yes
let's not count Alexander Mikhailovich Ovechkin out completely yet. 
"You're implying that a team that has been working on being consistently competitive for a full season (and finally able to do it) were self sabotaging just so they could not pay their incredibly talented 2nd overall pick?

That's not how it works."
"Even if your comment didn’t read like it was written by a fucking idiot, it’s still dumb."
"2+2+2+2=8, quik maffs"
PATTY’S GOING FOR A HATTY
Not anymore.
"It's sounds crazy, but on the shots that go in you can almost feel something happening before it does and before you know it the puck is bouncing out from the back of the net"
"Yeah that's what Maurice was saying in his rookie year that he's never seen someone score goals in his life like Laine in practice.  His problem was just that he was such a bad skater that it could sort of be contained, but he hit another gear lately with his ability to get open and they've been 50/50 in the last 10.  He's a shooting savant"
Also posts and misses don't count against shot% as they don't count as shots.  He probably misses 5 shots for each one that goes in.
"Its actually more of a surprise when he misses than when he scores. Its pretty nuts, and I'll be honest, I've not ever seen it before, from all over the ice."
Nah. He'll be in the league until he's 45.
"I missed the ""Unsustainable!!""  comments "
Really? Realistically and all?
The guy loves to troll the media so he will do what it takes 
The thing is with ovi minutes come ovi matchups. Part of this current streak is feasting on lower competition. 
Kings only answer to God.
"Yeah Staal, Kuch, Seguin, better Karlsson ^^^^/s, and even MacK could very well jump in the race. "
I think he gets more tbh. If he wants to he could break the bank at something like 10x8. He's in an elite class for rookie and sophomore goal scores. Does he want to give the Jets a discount is the question I think.
I don’t think that is enough. He’s the best goal scorer to enter the league since Ovechkin.
What do you mean by scaling up to 8 x 8? I'm tired right now so I'm a little confused
"With 2 goals per game, the rocket is Laine’s"
nah i think Ovy still wins it
"I mean, if he shoots 48% again over his next 9 like he has over his last 9 he deserves it, but somehow I'm skeptical of that happening"
You’re
Got it
You beat me to it
Gotta beat Teemu!
"To be fair, there's nothing sustainable about shooting 50% over a span of 10 games. If that were the case he'd score 94-ish goals a season.

Edit: It would actually be more like 118 goals over the course of an 82 game season. He'd have 94 right now."
"I'm a huge fan of the kid, just trying to calm my expectations of him. :)"
~~/s~~
"Him and Ehlers are good buds and I think if he is interested in cups, the way we are playing could very well give him a good shot at them. Scheif and Ehlers both took super team friendly contracts, so I am hoping he will as well."
Let's say this is rookie Ovechkin entering the league right now instead of Laine... he's making the BANK of all bank.
"last few years of his contract will probably 8 mill, while the start of the contract will be 6 mill

Probably not the right terminology, but it's the only wording I could think of at the time"
"Anywhere from 6 - 6.5 mil to 8 mil, for 8 years"
"Meanwhile in NY it's PAT-TRICK! Last one empty netter from their own blue line (only about half a minute left, so it also wasn't that risky move from game result perspective as Jets were two up...) PAT-TRICK LAINE got just upgraded to #38"
See even your correction is dumb. Jesus read a book.
Ya called it lol
I'm okay with this.
"People were saying his 18% was unsustainable. Now he's putting up numbers like 50% for stretches. He's almost, almost, rewriting what's possible with that type of shot."
We'll see! Would be a real coup for the Jets if he signs for anything less than $8mil.
He's also stated that money is not a big deal to him several times.
Yeah I gotta agree. Fellow Jets fans are WAY too optimistic about the deal he will get.
"Ah, I see what you're saying."
think he'll shoot 48% for the rest of the year? That's what's propelled this streak - an *insane* shooting %. Somehow I doubt it keeps up.
"damn. i stand corrected. maybe he does win it
"
Yeah Jesus did read a book the Bible 
It’s all good cuz the GAOT finally got a hatty after so many almost hatties.
"Lmao, could you imagine? Shit would be insane"
"Oh yeah, I mean even at 8 mill I would be happy, but I am hoping for something like 7 to keep it more team friendly and allow us to build a super deep team. Like we have right meow lol."
Most Jets fans are dreaming lmfao. Not a chance he signs for less than 8m.
Yep. 8mil per is optimistic I think. I would be happy about 9 per year. That would be a bargain in a few years. 
"Doesn't have to, it's enough he does half of that. He'll get around 40-50 shots in his remaining games on the regular sesson, make one of every four and it's near 50 goals and Ovie might have to bow to him."
"It would be absurd lmao. If he keeps even near this pace for goals over the next 16, we could be looking at around 50+ goals this season! Most likely will not happen, but a man could dream ;p."
"Team defense against him would just be ""Literally everyone get in front of the shot"""
My balls would be withered niblets.
Jets are going to be in a real bind if Kyle Connor also keeps playing this well. It's a good problem to have though! Random question: Do you think Trouba is gone this offseason? 
Would be the first player to score 50 other than Ovi since Malkin and Stamkos (who actually hit 60) in 11-12. Ovi did it 2 years ago with 50 on the dot. Can I just say how crazy it is that Stamkos has a 60 goal season that's never talked about? I mean holy shit.
"No way, Trouba is our best right handed defenseman. All signs point too his previous contract issues being about exactly what he said... his ice time. He has been playing top line minutes this season and I haven't heard any issues from his camp since. We would be foolish to get rid of him. He is a big part of our core."
"To be honest, yes. Unless we can get him on a great deal, I don't know what we will do with our available budget, unless of course the cap ceiling goes up a lot more over this and next year."
"Stamkos actually hit 60 in our building, we gave him a [standing ovation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wquot7A_cl0)."
"Yeah, it'd be pretty wild and I would be a very happy man haha. I still remember the 60 goal season, it wasn't even all that long ago, but you're right about it not being brought up often. I am glad to see Stammer healthy and playing well for the Bolts and are equally glad that team is over in the east lol."
"Stammer scored the 60th, in Winnipeg, and we all gave him a standing ovation.

https://youtu.be/Wquot7A_cl0

That was to go up 3-1 in the game, beginning of the 3rd. And he got a standing ovation.

I like to think Laine coming to Winnipeg. The Finnish connection, and the way he's for in, is some sort of correcting of the hockey universe."
"Very cool moment. Also, I didn't even realize the Jets have been back for 7 years now. Doesn't feel that long ago at all as an outside observer of the team."
"Tampa is scary as fuck, especially after adding McDonagh and Miller at the deadline. Now you can't just worry about Hedman, you've got another top 2 d-man back there in support. I really am happy for Stamkos too because he's had just about as tough of a stretch as one can go through as an athlete injury wise"
"We shut down Portage and Main when they announced the return, I remember that like it was yesterday. Man, time flies."
"Oh yeah, 100% I do not envy you guys if you end up playing them early this year. I find it unlikely you get them first round though. I am more than happy to see him succeed as I was a huge fan of his when he entered the league."
Ovie scored 65 goal season one time
"Boston's going to be hard enough as a first round matchup, although I wonder how much Bergeron and McAvoy's injuries will affect their play in a series against us. They won't come back until they're 100%, but it can't be easy returning from leg/knee injuries right into playoff hockey. With Matthews at least it's his shoulder so he's able to skate."
"Oh yeah, having those two out will certainly hurt them a lot in the post season. Know hockey players though, they will return for the playoffs most likely. Looks like we will both have tough runs to the cup if we make it that far. Would be a blast to see a Jets VS Leafs final, it would be a wild series."
"Oh man would it ever. You never know, it could definitely happen in the next few years if not this year when you look at the trajectories of both teams."
"I know the London Knights are impressive, but got damn has Halifax ever been owning the early part of the 1st Round lately.

MacKinnon, Drouin, Ehlers, Meier, Hischier, Zadina."
I want Jet Woo just for that name. That's a great name for any sport.
"Andrei Svechnikov is #2. He is scoring at a 0.89 goal per game rate, he’s one of the main reasons Barrie is doing as well as they are. The media will continue to try and act like Zadina will be #2 (just like they tried to say Brady Tkachuk could be top 3 post-WJC), but passing up on an elite goal scoring prospect is not going to happen.

I think he has Sandin and Khovanov too high. Both seem like 2nd founders to me. Especially Khovanov after his health issues and with his skating being an issue.

I’m glad he is giving some love to Quinn Hughes skating. Best in the draft in my opinion, reminds me of the quick and agile Letang on the blue line. "
Everyone getting all excited about some of the D + the 2 main wingers but its mah boy Wahlstrom who is gonna blow people out of the water in 2 years
Comparing this with Pronmans rankings is ... interesting lol.
Yes please keep underrating Evan Bouchard
"Ty Smith and Merkley should be higher, way too much skill to pass up. I don't get the hype for McIsaac. "
"Helps when players decide to go there. 

Vancouver Giants had his import rights for Zadina when he was 16 but he stayed at home before going over to Halifax. "
Just can’t stop that moose
Plus we're finally good again!
Not to mention Jared McIsaac and Groulx
Top ranked name for sure.
I want him on Winnipeg
Do you think Zadina isn't an elite goal scoring prospect? He sure looked like one when I watched him at WJC.
"I disagree on Ryan Merkley. He’s a defenseman, he’s going to have to grow into a capable defensive role. I wouldn’t take him any higher than 25th until he shows me he’s not just going to be a Justin Schultz copy."
Why is Halifax a preferred destination?
"I did not say that, no.

But Svechnikov has a higher scoring rate in a less offensive league with less offensive help. He has everything you want in a #2 pick. He can skate, he can make plays, he can shoot, he has size and everything he’s done so far is showing in his play, both in junior and at the WJC, where he did very well despite playing on a lower line and coming off a hand injury."
Zadina's  top pick IMO if not for Svech and Dahlin
Wait wait wait... If you know a player is going to turn into Justin Schultz there's no way he's not going inside the top 25. 
Stanley cup winner Justin Schultz? 
"One of the best development programs in the CHL, nice city and clearly good recruitment by the management to get all these imports to go there. "
"Yeah, I agree. Svech should be #2"
Well that is what being third means 😅
"He’s not going to for sure turn into Justin Schultz. I’m saying with his skill set and what he’s shown, he’s not likely to go very early because he doesn’t have the defensive acumen to be more than a 2nd (maybe even 3rd) pairing offensive minded guy and PP specialist. And that is if he reaches his ceiling. 

Dahlin, Bouchard, Boqvist, Dobson — they all have shown they have skill sets to really be top pairing guys. They can be the guy on their pairing, not needing a crutch. Even a guy like McIsaac may not have the offensive potential of Merkley, but he is solid in his own zone.

Merkley is a risk. He has not been that good at all defensively in the OHL. That’s not a good sign for the future. The risk of him busting completely is higher than those ranked ahead of him and outweighs some of the offensive gifts he has."
"Fair. What kind of player would you compare him to? I'm naturally inclined to say Ryan Murphy but that may just be some sort of cognitive bias given their similar names, height, and offensive domination of the OHL. "
"He reminds me a lot of Anthony Deangelo, who is one who’s actually not been able to put it all together at the NHL level yet. Both are gifted with the puck and on the PP. Another is Derrick Pouliot. 

A team who drafts Merkley needs to be patient, have good developmental staff and get him to a reasonable plateau. If he can be like Justin Schultz, awesome — 2nd pairing OFD who needs a strong partner but can put up points is not bad for a 1st round pick. Maybe he can go higher, but it’s also even more likely he doesn’t even reach that. The risk is what scares me off — I’d rather go with McIsaac/Smith/Woo after the top guys at this point."
That Barzal kid is pretty decent at that hockey game
"Good see he’s having success in the NHL.

One of my favorite Seattle Thunderbirds to watch."
"The silver lining of Brock losing is that Barzal is from Coquitlam so really, as long as one of those 2 won I wouls be happy.  Both are damn stud muffins.  I lowkey hope the Isles can win it all so Barz brings the cup to the lower mainland"
"Coming from a season ticket holder, Barzal has been clearly the most noticeable guy I've seen on the ice this year in Vancouver. "
"Guy could become a Top 6 forward

Edit - people can't tell the obvious sarcasm, apparently."
He likes to hockey.
"So fun to watch. Consistently the best player on the ice, you could tell he was legit. "
"i would temper those expectations.  
Edit - people can't tell the obvious sarcasm, apparently."
On team Canada. 
His smile while everyone came over to him did my soul good. 
[Stone cold Steve Mason!](https://i.imgur.com/JBnlAo8.jpg) 
Can't build a brick wall without a Mason
"Me: Why are the Jets starting Mason over Hellebuyck

Steve Mason: *shuts out Rangers*"
Winnipeg is fucking good.
Perfect game for him to get his confidence back.
"not even salty (go tank!) but damn easy shut out, we were awful"
"Good for him. I was kinda sad to see him leave Philly tbh

edit: spellingz"
Today was a good day.
Does that mean Mason isn't playing on Thursday?
"Oh yeah, Mason is a Jet nowadays.. Given his season I had completely forgotten about the poor guy. Good for him, and go Jets! "
Nice!
He sacrificed a black chicken for that puck luck he had to lead to the shutout
"He may be a Jet now, but the Rangers-Flyers Rivalry knows no boundaries "
"I hope this means he's starting to heat up, and right before playoffs, too. With the way Helle has been playing all season and a hot Mason going into the playoffs would get me all hot and bothered."
I’ve been waiting for that moment since the season opener.
Watching him and Hellebuyck buddyin' as they skated off the ice together made me smile.
"I have to root for fellow full right goalies, and I'm glad he's on the Jets now. It was hard to root for him in Philly."
Breaking glass and kicking ass!!
Hellebuyck wouldve sent them to the shadow realm
I think Mason had 2 shutouts in his last 3 games at MSG or something like that. 
You and most of us Jets fans! There's a real good reason we aren't the ones getting paid to make these decisions.
Good on Mason!
"I know, I'm scared too"
Definitely could've hit the net a few more times and it would've been a different game 
"When the Zucc wraparound went across the entire goal line, you could kind of feel a shutout brewing."
"I don’t know about easy, man.


He had some serisouly nice saves "
I didnt understand why management kicked him out of town. I thought he was great in philly
"Me too, had a dream he came back. I hope for the sake of how his career has been that he wins a Cup someday."
"About that, you get Hellebuyck."
Jobu definitely has the Jets covered.
https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/d633cca2-e244-4ad7-8a31-d3ba0e0b9d5b
Happy for him
Damn
Well shit
Yeah true. I still think Helle over Mason tho
Yeah but I think Hellebuyck should start over him.
Zuuuuc should of had it (twice)
"When Winnipeg started their backup, you could feel the shutout brewing. "
Too inconsistent. He had some stellar performances but also a lot of dumpster fires. Hextall wants to choose his own long-term goalie and Mason's contract was up so it was easiest to just let him walk.
Boo
**FUCK**
Gilmour and Fast also missed wide open nets
70 G in 125 GP. Geno is not fair.
Anders Lee being 8th on that list is pretty unreal. 
"Third teenager with four career hattricks, joining Jimmy Carson and Dale Hawerchuk. 

Edit: First visiting teenager with a hattrick at MSG since Ted Kennedy in 1944. "
"Wait, Eric Staal? What are they feeding him in Minnesota?"
Kuch with 170 points in 138 games is pretty sick too but then you see McDavid with 120 assists and my jaw hit the damn floor 
Who the fuck is Anders Lee and why are we never talking about him? I honestly have no idea who that is and where he plays but he's in some pretty elite company there. 
"Somebody hit me with that copypasta, I'm almost there"
Holy fuck 2016 draft was incredible
"If it wasn’t for goddamn injuries, Eichel would be on this list too. 

Had 22 goals in 55 this year and 24 in 61 the year before. 

That’s around a 65 goal pace too. And before the injury he was on at least a 2ppg pace through January and beginning of February. "
"This man, he score the.puck"
"Just wondering, do you think Laine has a chance at hall of fame? I mean, he's right up there. Idk, maybe it's just me but I think he has a case?"
What is the date range here? 
"Yeah I think that stat might be the most impressive of them all tbh

Edit: not to mention 80+ assists 🤔"
Most under rated player of this generation?
"""Right now I'm struggling. ... Hockey is really hard for me right now."" 
Patrik Laine Nov. 2"
It’s a shame he doesn’t get much love on here. The guy is an absolute beast
Hard to believe JFK's brother was so good at hockey 
"I love Laine but I'm not really surprised that this happens extremely rarely.

How many teens play AND dominate in the NHL as soon as they get in? Not many, especially back in the days when you were more likely to spend time in the minors to develop.

Then you also have to get a hat trick which is a huge challenge in itself, on the road where you're more likely to lose and against one single specific team that's been decent or good for most of its existence. 

By playing with the settings that you care about you can make a lot of goals/achievements look more impressive than they really are. 

Anyway, I'm done hating. Congrats Laine 👍🏾

"
"Prompting many young fans to ask, ""who's Jimmy Carson?"""
Friendliness. 
Well instead of putting him on the third line as a winger they made him a top center where he should be. He had a decent season last year as well but he has been unreal this year.
"Minnesota was similar enough to Thunder Bay to give him his groove back.

McJesus is pretty good.
Plays on the wing on a line with Josh Bailey and some dude.
Yeah fuck off buddy........
"Truly 1A 1B, in any other year (par 2015), both of them would have went as 1 pick."
We must rebuild him with new ankles
"Definitely too early in his career. I'd say if he keeps his pace for is tenure in the league, maybe. "
"Give him a few years at this pace, and he can be talked about as a great. So far, he is just a super impressive kid looking to make a dent in the league... In my opinion."
Beginning of the 2016 season till last night 
"For some reason I read ""assist"" as eat ass and thought I somehow went to the wrong subreddit while sleeping "
I had to look up what team he played for. I guess I haven't watched the Islanders in awhile.
"Oddly enough, they died 11 days apart. "
The second part was more so just an interesting fact but I doubt many teenagers have had a chance to score a hat trick at MSG since then. 
Traded for Wayne
"Living in Thunder Bay and Minnesota game makes for a great weekend road trip (far better then the jets because of cost reasons).

Is 100% close enough to Thunder Bay to get his mojo back."
"Ohhh that center, that's looking for a new team next year..."
haha meant it as sarcasm but yes I agree
If he keeps this pace he will walk to the hall easily. That would also mean he would never score under 30 goals.
What do you sub to that made you think that?!
You've missed out on some entertaining hockey. They give up a hell of a lot of goals but also score a ton. It's terrible as a fan but I'm sure hockey fans that don't follow the Isles enjoy it.
:(
"Nothing 

I am only subbed to this and r/winnipegjets

40 this year?  Or 40... THIS GAME?
"Kid is next level. Literally anytime he has an opportunity to get a decent shot off from anywhere inside the blue line, it’s a threat."
11 goals and 17 points in the last ten

can't stop won't stop
Hide your moms...

That crack of the blade/puck and then the whip sound in the mesh. Two of the best sounds in hockey. 
He's made these last games so goddamn fun to watch 
It was good luck from the boobs. 
Laine 3 Rangers zero. :(
What a wrist.
"We can talk about the beard. It is his way to annihilate people who are not goalies. He knows beard is awful, and he knows you must endure countless high light reels and slowmos featuring it, simply looking at it in impotent rage as he scores goals. It is mindset like this that sets momfuckers apart from motherfuckers.

"It surprises me to think that he still hasn't gotten a hatty this year, he had 3 last year.

Ah well, save em for Minnesota in the playoffs. "
"Whenever I see him with a decent scoring chance I always just assume it's going to go in, and it usually does"
"It's absolutely insane these last few games. There's nothing blocking the goalie's view, no lateral movement, he just picks his spot and they can't do anything about it. Nobody scores goals like this consistently in the NHL anymore... or so I thought."
And he's our threat. 😆
"Plus, he just looks fucking terrifying with that beard. "
That beard don't quit bb
Shooting above 50% during this stretch.
12G 18P in his last nine including this game. Whew.
Unreal.
So it’s basically a coin flip to see if he scores? 
"For real, despite that so-called ""rivalry"" that was pushed by the media last year, Winnipeg is my team in the west. Hoping they crush this year."
">Can you imagine if he gets the Rocket

If he does I hope he still has the beard on stage."
he looks like Krampus the Christmas Goblin
45.8% shooting percentage over 9 games is absolutely insane. 
you'll see it live on Thursday 
👏💣🍆🤰🎡🏒🙌🚹
That was actually nice work from Statsny also. It looks like that he is blocking just one guy but he is between 3 guys and the shooting point.
Are you happy now? :(
"He's had 14 multi goal games in his career (138 Games, 71 Goals, 51 Assists)

That's crazy."
His shooting percentage has to be like 30% lately
"Aaaaaand there he goes again. I’ve been watching hockey my entire life, I have never seen a player score at will like this, let alone a fucking 19 year old."
1 goal in the last game if this game is the last game
So like goalie interference calls?
"Basically just described my feelings for the caps. If it can’t be us, I’d like to see them get some success."
"Pushed by the media, and most of r/leafs! "
He said in an interview that it's gone as soon as his season is over :(
"Fear or cheer, Belsnickel is here! Have you been Impish, or Admirable??"
plz no
Yes :D
Actually over 45% since mid february http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/patrik-laine-s-still-a-rocket-long-shot-but-he-s-blasting-his-way-into-elite-company
18.something% this season but 40 something over the course of the last bunch of games
Early days Ovi and Stammer was gross. 
You want a job at NBC?
"A lot of people ended up buying into the narrative, which was pretty natural seeing how two elite talents were coming hot out of the gates."
"i saw it live on sunday

it’s majestic"
I thought it would’ve been 50%. Either he scores or he doesn’t right? 
"Holy cow, unsustainable but dead sexy."

That's usually how it works.
Good to see hockey return there. 
"Newfoundland is a tough place for a pro team to function, it's farther than even what most people would consider far, travel options are limited and costly, and weather all too frequently makes travel to and from the island impossible, sometimes for days.

I'm not sure how many more times teams are going to try this, hopefully this one sticks. "
time to move my Newfoundland jerseys
It's pretty fitting to do it against us. I'm rooting for him to get to 40 
After he left NY he purified himself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.
Idc if he's in the Central. Seeing Eric perform this well after the Elder hit (which I thought effectively ending his elite playing level days) is fantastic. Guy is awesome.
He has 35 this year? what the hell
That's pretty **w i l d**
Just got his second of the game with most of the game remaining.
And yet people thought he was too slow for the league 1-2 years ago
"Canes still love you, Staalsy. Willing to contribute to your goal totals to their own detriment."
3.5m a year for a 40 goal scorer. Not bad.
"When combined, waters from all around this state form the fountain of youth, and when frozen, the purest soul on the ice experiences the effects of the fountain of youth. This is the only explanation that makes any sense to me. ILY Staal bb never change ❤️"
Wtf that's crazy. 
I thought he was declining. Wtf?
He did it again!
"Wow, and they had Heatley."
"I remember the game where Gaborik scored five goals against the Rangers like it was yesterday. He made them look like amateurs.

I also remember how Eric Staal did very little in his 1/3 season in NY."
"Wow, surprised that this is only the 2nd Wild Player to hit that feat. 

Thought Parise would do that in the few years he murdered the Avs. "
"One day this won't hurt anymore. Today is not that day.

Super happy for him and hope that he not only can get another cup but can get 40 goals this season. "
Only the 2nd?
One of my favourite players that doesn't wear a Leafs jersey. Dude is playing some solid hockey this season.  Hope he hits his pace of 43.
"Not the Wild, but Dino Ciccarelli did it six times with the North Stars."
don't worry i'm sure Parise will get there at some point over the next 7 years at $7.5M AAV...
He's on pace to hit 43 and dethrone Gaborik
"Rid himself of AVs ultra poor deployment and usage.



It can help anyone.

3rd line left wing suck my ass."
Game....blouses.
"Computer Blue.

Darling Pinkie "
There's nothing pure about Minnetonka. 
Yea fuck Edler for that hit. Especially since it wasn't even during the season 
When was this 2012?
36
^^*quietly*
Go home you're drunk
I dunno if it is his size or his stride but even when he is skating quickly and leaving defenders behind he just doesn't look fast; it's a weird phenominon.
Don't you fucking jinx him. Take it back!
"You know, that or super solid work ethic and desire to prove something. I do like yours better."
Join the club. 
"I as I understand it, he was under-utilized before coming to the Wild.  Give the man the top line center spot and he's shown us he's still got it."
"Unfortunately, management has loved to go after goalscorers once they've peaked. Vanek, Heatley, Setoguchi, etc.

The one exception is Gaborik, but he was surrounded by mediocrity. His 42 goals were in 2007, I think, and at that point the Wild were still a team of mediocre players. Had Gaborik joined the league with the current Wild team, he likely could have been a multi 50+ goal scorer."
He did very little because AV buried him on the 3rd line. What an idiot.
"Yeah, right before Christmas. Lundkvist broke stuff in the dressing room I heard.  

He was played on 3LW. He went there to play with Rick Nash. They had chemistry from international. Then hockey genius Alain Vigneault knew better. Fire your coach."
He was actually carried off the ice by the team that game.
"If only the league had accepted the proposal that Minnesota play only Colorado for 82 times one season, he would've had Rocket Richard and Art Ross in the bag."
You try being coached by Jacques Lemaire for almost a decade. 
"I love how Devils fans hate Parise. Grow up buddy, he's a classy guy. Can't blame him for wanting to play in his home state, and leave your dumpster fire team that finally got decent 6 years later"
He had 33 at one point
"43 is unacceptable, I demand 50in18"
"Probably the dumbest coaching decision I've ever seen. I'll never get over it. Why trade for him then, why give up 2 2nd round picks? Just thinking about it makes me mad. His use of Yandle was also mindblowingly stupid."
............pankcakes.
"Yeah, after the Love Boat I think that lake should be quarantined."
Lol someone downvoted you but it’s true- I wouldn’t eat any fish out of that lake
"If it's any consolation, Edler has been fucking terrible ever since that hit. He's terrified to hit anybody now. Before that hit, he was one of our most physical defensemen. Now, he'll only touch people if he's in a foul mood."
"Yes, it was. And this is the first year Eric has come close to playing at the level he did before the hit."
2013
Real talk tho it's nice to see this good Canadian boy get back on track 
"He isn't the most agile guy, which I think plays a big part of it. He uses his size really well though and does have the straight line speed to keep up. Really happy to see him playing well."
45 goal scorer!
"Throw Pominville, Havlat, and maybe Ennis to the list as well. The only goal scorer that we’ve picked up *past their prime that’s worked out super fantastically is Staal.


*Staal has no peak, and will never age. He is perpetually in his prime"
"Imagine a line of Kreider, Staal, and Nash. Would be terrifying to play against."
Noooooooo!..............
"Koivu, Havlat (for one of the last years he was good) or Parise I figured would have done it"
lmao now he's crippling your salary cap for the next 7 years! 
"And major back surgery. He'll get better, and I hope he gets back to the 30+ figures again. He's done pretty good coming back in the past month.  "
Oh shit here we go again lmao I have a sudden urge to light a heater. 
I am positive Eric had the same thoughts and many SMH moments each and every game AV announced his lines. So I am sure he jumped for joy to leave NY. AV is trash.
"It's close, but nothing beats Iggy as 3rd line LW by Bylsma"
There are literally thousands of better alternatives in Minnesota. 
At least he learnt from it?
"Personally, I always thought it looked like it happened because edler was scared to deliver a big hit in an Olympic tourney, especially with Erics head down a little - I would caution all those fans who think headshots should be auto penalties no matter what to take a good look at that hit and how it developed"
"""Fucking terrible""

The best method in identifying someone's complete lack of analytic skill is if they shit on edler.

Edler is inconsistent but he is a fucking top pair d man. He's on pace for a 40 pt season and he regularly makes shit d men look awesome when they play on his right side."
"That hit set our franchise back more than just a bit, not just from his play (perpetually 9-12 in EC standings) but in the hit to his trade value as well. It's not all bad, Saarela looks pretty good. "
"no it was 2013, after his phenomenal 2012-13 season (lock-out season, had 53 points, would equate to >90 in a full season)"
"The injury was never expected to mess him up this bad is the odd thing though, it was just a couple fractured bones and a hyper extension or something, I believe all his ligaments were ok? He was back playing later that year I thought. "
Played pretty well last year.
For sure dude he's a stud
⊙△⊙
He hasn't even begun to peak!
Parise 
"One game we had Stalberg, Staal, Nash.....it was fucking awesome. One fucking game."
"Parise came close! Had 33 one year, Rolston had 34 one year too—he was great for us. Havlat only managed 22 and was only with us two years, and Koivu surprisingly hasn't cracked 25! That one surprised me, I knew he hadn't hit thirty but figured he'd gotten closer. "
"He'll put up 0.5 p/gp for the next few years and we'll be fine with it. Yeah it's shitty given what he used to be, but that's why Arizona has a team, so we can dump them his salary"
I have a sudden urge to light myself on fire
"Like,  10 thousand?"
He didnt. His back is fucked up. Thats why hes not as physcial.
The mental injury is a lot harder to come back from. Reminding your brain that your ligaments have healed and won't just snap on you if you turn is the biggest hurdle. 
"Parise hasn’t been bad, he’s just been hurt and expensive. Worth it? Idk. I think he brings positive energy to the team and I think he’s picking up again. I think he will be huge in the playoffs"
" > 25!

25! = 1.5511210043330986e+25

"
"fyi i dont hate parise, he's still one of my favorite playesr its just hilarious you guys signed him to such a retarded contract. "
"With the way the Hawks have played this year, I'm surprised you've resisted that feeling for so long."
"Hey, I'll light your ass back up on fire"
"... spoons, when all you neeeeeeed is a knife"
"Acktuually 11,842 

*pushes glasses up from brim of nose to eyes*"
But his ligaments were never injured is what I'm saying.
"He just plays to hard and gets injured. I do think the contract was a bit too much. He is also a good player to come up big in a few critical spots so, whatever. "
what the hell is the point of this bot
Bad bot
"Eat it, Gretzky."
13 years is fucking absurd. It'll work out better for Suter though
I'm guessing the multiple stanley cups helps curb the temptation...
my hemorrhoids finally died down plz no.
"it's like meeting the lake of your dreams, then getting bit by a pike"
"Full list-  
  
Petry (66 GP), Alzner (66 GP), Benn (63 GP), Mete (49 GP), Morrow (38 GP), Schlemko (34 GP)Weber (26 GP), Jerbek (25 GP), Davidson (13 GP), Juulsen (7 GP), Reilly (4 GP), Lernout (3 GP), Streit (2 GP), Valiev (1 GP)"
Now that's impressive depth ^/s
Hopefully he pans out.
Reilly is looking very promising.
Did he play last nigjt?  How did he do?
"When you have no-one on good defence then obviously they are going to use a lot of defensemen. Good job Marc
"
"5 of them have played less than 7 games, ~~3~~ 4 of them arent even on the team anymore and another 3 are injured "
"""Better than last year's defense"""
Quantity over quality.
"Gotta get that ""NHL experience"" in."
Injuries are a big part of it too
"Four are gone.  Morrow, Jerabek, Davidson and Streit."
Honestly forgot Davidson started with us this year. 
"NHL experience for a guy who is going to be a life time AHLer
"
But when all of the defensemen are ass it docent matter
They’re not though 
Lemieux/Francis
Yzerman/Fedorov
Crosby/Malkin
"The only ones really in discussion are:

Gretzky/Messier

Lemieux/Francis

Sakic/Forsberg

Yzerman/Fedorov

Crosby/Malkin

And....drumrolll....the one everybody is forgetting:

**Lemieux/Crosby**

Granted, they only played together for 26 games, and Lemieux was at the very end of his career while Sid was a rook, but if we're talking best centers for their careers of all time on the same team, I'd say that's it. Mario and Sid are both top 5 players all time IMO, and they both played together for 26 games in 2005-06, which technically fits OP's vague criteria.

If we're talking both being the best at the same time, it's one of the other four options, and honestly I think francis was always a little behind the other guys on the list so I'd lean towards prime Gretz/Mess, Yzerman/Fedorov, Sakic/Forsberg, or Sid/Geno."
"Take your pick of

Lemieux/Francis

Yzerman/Federov

Sakic/Forsberg

Crosby/Malkin"
Sakic/Forsberg
Beliveau and H Richard? 
Drouin and DLR ^^^^^^/s
"I get this sub doesn't like Moose, but its gotta be Gretzky/Messier.

"
Lemieux and Francis
"I just want to know if there’s been a center duo in NHL history other than 87/71 that have each won multiple scoring titles, the Hart, and the Conn Smythe."
Grezky/Messier probably
Lemieux/Francis
Mario/Francis or Crosby/Malkin 
Desharnais/Holland
"1) Gretzky Messier
2) Beliveau H Richard
3) Crosby Malkin
4) Mario Francis
5) Sakic Forsberg
6) Yzerman Fedorov"
So this thread makes me ask (because I had never thought of it in tgese terms) is the matchup of Yzerman/Fedorov vs Sakic/Forsberg the most talented rivalry in NHL history? 
"If it ain’t did and Geno it’s Mario and Francis. 

But Imo did is the best player in the world over the last decade and number 2 is Geno so it’s hard to argue a better tandem"
Staal/Staal....^^/s
Yzerman and Fedorov I would say. 
"Gagner/Arcobello

DEPTH"
Not that I think it's the best but H. Sedin and Kesler was some pretty decent centre depth.
"Definitely a homer pick, but Henrik/Kesler in their primes was pretty dominant. Not really in the same league as Lemieux/Francis but still"
Koivu and Ribeiro 
"gretzky / messier

foppa / sakic

yzerman / fedorov 

all others unworthy "
Marchand/Marchand
McDavid and Draisaitl. Don’t @ me. 
McDavid/Strome
"Bergeron/Krejci

One is a perennial Selke candidate the other has led the playoffs in scoring twice. Also, Bruins are now 4-0 with Bergeron sidelined. "
Man the Pens have been spoiled.
Fedorov 
Starting to look like it
"Gretzky, Lemieux, Orr, and Jagr probably take the top 5 spots. "
Hi Marc
I think you mean Desharnais & De La Rose
>outside of Gretzky/Messier
"4 cups together. I won’t bother looking up scoring titles and individual awards, we all know they’re there."
[deleted]
"Federov Yzerman is the closest

Yzerman won Conn Smythe

Federov won Hart in 93/94

Both won Selke 

Yzerman won Masterton

Both won Pearson"
87/66 puts their trophy case to shame
Absolutely. 
Didney Crosby
Why answer the question if you’re not... you know.. going to answer the question? 
Not even top 100 duos probably.  And not being snarky
Ribeiro and cocaine
"Drai has played a good amount of time on the wing hasn't he? I mean if he actually consistently plays C and the Oilers play better in the coming years, perhaps there is a chance."
"This place is gonna be pissed off when McDavid/Draisaitl are the best two centers in the league over the next couple years and after the lockout. The Oil got Boardwalk and Park Place, sure they're out this year but over time...they got Boardwalk and Park Place, they're gonna build on that and probably win the Cup."
"Lol no.  They aren't even the best in the league right now.

They definitetly arent the best all time "
I mean I guess I can say Kopitar/Carter now if this is the bar
[removed]
u/FedorovNotFederov
"Drouin, Danault, Desharnais, De La Rose.

Bergevin missed his chance to play real 4D (C)hess"
"To be fair, OP did list them at the very top."
"Absolute top of the page

>outside of Gretzky/Messier"
"So with Sid and Geno

Both have won two Art rosses

Both have won the Hart (Crosby 2, Malkin 1)

Both have won the Pearson/Lindsay (Crosby 3, Malkin 1)

Both have won the Conn Smythe (Crosby 2, Malkin 1)

Crosby has 2 Rocket Richards

Malkin won the Calder

I kinda like their trophy case better

"
Lol fuck me
"The other guy got downvoted for saying it but yeah. To contri ute to the conversation. Lot of people are just giving the same answers, so may as well throw a different one out there. It's obviously not the best but what's the point of another person saying Lemieux/Francis?"
to contribute to the conversation 
"Yeah that's why I said it was a homer pick... They were the duo I grew up watching more than anyone else mentioned in this thread, and wanted to throw it out there"
"The way the Oilers' luck is, they'll be like the guy who has hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place, any all the other players keep rolling right past them on their way to Go.  

Eventually, they'll draw ""You are assessed for street repairs – $40 per house, $115 per hotel"" or ""Make general repairs on all your property – For each house pay $25, for each hotel $100"" 

Then they'll mortgage those properties just to stay in the game."
I love blatant homerism
Scheifele and Little/Stastny? We really need a younger 2nd line centre lol.
Yikes
"Now this would have been

*D*ank"
I actually agree
"An aside, but wasn't Yzerman Crosby's favorite player growing up?"
"If it ain't did, it ain't done."
Are you asking or telling?
Well it’s kind of like someone asking “what’s the best type of apple” and you saying “strawberries”. If the conversation is about the best centre duo of all time there’s no point putting forth a duo that wasn’t even the best in the league when they were together. 
They could be in the conversation for best two centers to never win a cup
I wear it on my sleeve and will never apologize for it
"He was actually. It’s pretty funny, over the last few seasons you can see Sid starting to model his game more and more after Yzerman. "
6 of one half a dozen of the other
"I mean at their very best they would've been 2nd to Sid and Malkin, and considering during their best seasons Sid was often injured I think it could be easily argued they were the best at that time.

Also I disagree with your metaphor. It's more like someone asked about the best apples and everyone is saying red delicious and I say Granny Smith deserves at least a mention."
look out we got a badass over here
Make it a half bakers dozen we gotta deal
What are you talking about?  They weren't even as good as Bergeron kreijci
"Seriously? Who decides to run with 3 goalies during regular season? That's incredibly stupid.

But that's the Islanders management I guess? 


Berube is at least seemingly better than Glass, which isn't saying much. He's played in the NHL before, and he can make a save. 

Beats having Forsberg in, who can't stop a rebound, or will be out of position. "
My BeruBAE <3
"Jean Francois ""Future PDOcast Co-host"" Berube."
I can’t tell you how thoroughly disappointed I was to see Berube underplayed with the Islanders after they picked him off waivers from the Kings. He was doing so well in our system and then he got screwed.
"That whole sequence of events makes no damn sense. ""Let's claim him off waivers, but never play him, but don't send him down either! He might get claimed!"" 

"
"Sadly that’s been happening a lot lately (Corrado, Hamilton, Hunt to name a few). "
"Yeah it never makes sense. I guess incompetent management? 

Or trying to use the guy as future tradebait. "
Because a player who hasn’t played in 2 months is so valuable...
"Like I said incompetent management. 

They'll try to use the guy for tradebait, but won't get shit. "

I... immediately sang this in my head after reading the original comment. Then I had to sing it again after I saw your comment
Severstal took SKA to OT!  Kagarlitsky does NOT give up!!
"Severstal might go down 4-0, but they have given the SKA a lot of trouble. Curious to see if CSKA, Yaroslavl or even Jokerit could beat them in 7"
"I hope, at some point this post-season, Znaroks comes to his senses and plays his better goalie instead of his vet."
"I mean, if you get swept, I don’t know if it really means anything how much “trouble” you gave them. 

If you flip this around, you could say SKA “found a way to win” every single game, even when the other team gave them trouble. You could then argue that bodes well for them through the rest of the playoffs, since they’ve struggled through adversity and shown mental toughness. 

Just pointing out that the final score is usually what matters, and sweeping anyone is pretty convincing evidence that they didn’t give you enough of a challenge to actually make you lose a game, just maybe made you nervous sometimes. "
"Last season Yaroslavl beat the #1 seed CSKA, so if any team could do it, potentially them, should be an interesting, and tough series for both teams."
"You're probably right, it doesn't, it's still a sweep. I (and maybe others) was expecting a sweep with larger scores and no overtimes, due to the difference between rosters/level/experience/payroll between the teams."
Any day you keep Datsyuk from scoring is a good day!
"Yeah.. I think SKA has been so ungodly good that anything short of winning by 3 (against a team other than CSKA or Jokerit) is seen as either SKA struggling or the other team playing really well 

It’s honestly impressive, their standards are so high that a not entirely dominant sweep can still be interpreted as problematic "
Is Jokerit good? I don't follow KHL but I know if I did it'd be the Finnish team 
"Currently 2nd in their division (behind SKA) and 3rd in the league (behind SKA and CSKA), they're not as good as either of the top two teams, but I'd say they're ""the best of the rest"", right ahead of Ak Bars and Lokomotiv this year

They're generally a top 5 or so team and they've been in the playoffs ever since joining the KHL, but I don't think that they've ever been seen as a true threat to win it all, mostly because they play in the same conference as SKA and CSKA"
yes

"I'd like to see 1 to 4 in each division, then the final four seeded by regular season record. Could see some interesting finals match-ups."
"I don't get it, people are constantly whining about wanting more divisional games because rivalries, but then they whine about divisional playoff matchups? "
"No, I prefer the current system, which increases the likelihood that we play the Capitals in the Second Round."
"I think the best way to do it is to have a hybrid system. Winner of each division is #1 and #2. Then the remaining seeds are based strictly on points. Not sure if you should keep it bracket style, or reseed each round."
No. I like that to play for the conference you have to win the division first. 
"Outside of the fact that the 2nd seeds in each division kind of get screwed, I think the issue of the same teams constantly meeting in the first round is annoying. "
"I liked the old one. 3 divisions, division leads are 1-3, then the next best 5. "
"I like the each division being represented, maybe 1-8 but at least the top team from division get in, relative to what their point total is. "
"That's how it was before, I'd like it to go back that way."
"100% the divisions aren't always balanced in terms of competiveness, neither are the conferences but they are a lot more on par than divisions. Not to mention 1 division has only 7 teams."
"No I almost like it how it is.

The only thing I would change is if there is a Wildcard team from each division, they stay in their respective divisions no matter what and don't crossover."
Yes. Points alone. Pure and just. No loopholes.
100% yes!
"100%
"
Yes. Would love a 1-16 playoff even more. The travel is a problem but who cares.
Yes 
I'm pretty sure everybody would. 
Yes and don't reseed each round.
While we’re at it can we also move back to Wales and Campbell Conference?  
"Just go back to the old playoff format.

"
Division winners and the 6 other best overall teams
"Yes.

Even though the Wings are in the east now, I know the west, and especially Central teams, get fuuuucked.

They have time zone issues on top of playing in the goddamn murderbowl. I can't think of a single *good* reason why you should get screwed out if s playoff spot if you got better results than teams in other weaker divisions. "
"NBA media and fans have been begging to get rid of conferences for a few years now for competitive reasons. Or keep conferences but reseed the the playoffs regardless of conference. 

I think the NHL should do something close to the later. Keep your division rivalries and travel schedule in the regular season, but t when the playoffs start div winners get locked into the top 4 seeds and every other team is reseeded regardless of conference. 

If there’s a scenario where a #2 in a div is better than another div winner they could be ranked higher than 4, so maybe the lowest a Div winner could be seeded is 5. 

It’s a nightmare for travel I know.

They could even reduce the first round to BO5 and give div winners another perk of getting 4 of those the 5 at home in the first round.

But this is all just a dream that I know would never happen."
It needs to go back to how it used to be. The new format doesn’t favour the teams that work their ass off all season long.
I would give the division winners the 1st 2 seeds but after that have it be the 6 next best teams. Basically do it like the old format but with only 2 teams moved to the top instead of 3.
I would be. The best teams should make It
Yes. The current system is the most retarded it's ever been 
I mean that's how it was before wasn't it
Drink!
"It alll depends on where your team is in the standings. You love it if gives you a softer matchup than you are all for it. We still have some games to go but if you look at it now Minnesota should have home ice advantage against Dallas, but as it stands now they will be the road team against WPG. Who probably arnt happy as well because in a 1-8 they would be playing SJ in the first round. 

To play devils advocate a WPG MIN  series sounds great. A 1-8 seeding would give us a Wash V Pitt series in the first round. 

I think current seeding is fine, until a team that isn’t in the top 8 of the conference makes it in the playoff. "
No. I would be in favour of 1-4 divisional rankings and no wild card spots.
Obviously. Last year was a perfect indication of why. We had to play the 2nd and 1st team in the league back to back and we were the 4th best team in the league. Literally makes no sense
"I would be in favor of 1-8 in the East, because there's no reason for it not to be.  The East is easy.  I'd also be in favor of the West being able to choose the format that fits the reality of the conference.  If all the western teams can agree to do 1-8, then by all means do it.  If they want a top 4 in each division, be my guest.  If they want to keep this weird wild card, that's ok too."
Playoffs are too bloated. Should be the 5 best teams from each conference with the bottom two seeds having a play in.
"Had to play the Presidents Trophy winner in the 2nd round, but got 12th overall then 16th overall in the finals.  Kind of sounds backwards."
"I dont want to be that guy but I will regardless, but it is straight up bullshit how people dont bitch about things until an eastern team is fucked over. The year before the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th best teams record wise were stuck in the central bracket no one outside of central fans said a word about how bullshit that was. Year later low and behold this playoff format is literally unusuable per east fans.

year before in 2015 the entire central division got 90 or more points but some teams still missed when they probably should have made it over Pit who was a complete waste of a spot that year"
That used to be the Smythe division.
">WPG vs ANA

I take Boston over Washington at this point. Our games against them were at least competitive. 
"Lol no matter what, Washington ends up playing Pittsburgh in an early round. "

FTFY /s"
I can live with this.
This time we sweep Ducks please 
"Right, weaker divisions excaberate the issue but playing a slightly (1-2 games) lobsided schedule isn't the problem. The Central ends up getting fucked in seeding each year despite playing a tougher regular season schedule. If the Central played less division games and more games against the Pacific, the Central teams would likely end up with more points, not less.

As you can see, in the Central, finishing 2nd or 3rd in the division forces you to punch well above your weight in the first round. It's enough of a problem where fans and the media (and most likely the teams themselves) actually talk about dropping games at the end of the season to fall to the 1WC and face an easier opponent in the 1st round. The route through the Pacific bracket is more frequently seen as an easier route to the WCF than needing to go through the Thunderdome bracket."
All this tells me is that the West is gonna be a bloodbath no matter who plays who. 
The Caps are leaving the party early this year.
When do we go back :/
"Playoff matchups are fun and intense regardless of divisional rivalries. Think back to Chicago-Vancouver in the early 2010s. It's a winner-take-all series, so every game has high stakes. 

Regular season games typically lack intensity and a sense of high stakes when you're not playing a divisional opponent. A win against a rival is really a four point win, rather than a two point win. A win against a team from another conference doesn't hold the same weight. "
That would only truly be the case if you got rid of the wild card though. 
I also like that it's possible for a Metro team to win the Atlantic and vice versa
"Yeah, rivalries suck."
Often you had a weak 3rd seed in the east because of the south east division.
"are you sure that means what you think it means? when do you think it was seeded 1-8, because the answer may surprise you"
So top 4 from each division?
">but who cares.

The NHLPA"
Teams traveling across the continent would care 
Fans will when playoff/division rivalries fall by the wayside.
"Yes, we desperately need to honour UK monarchs and former league presidents."
They do.
The league once knowingly guaranteed an expansion team a trip to the Final.
"Nope, before the top 3 seeds were the top 3 teams from each division"
"""The east is easy"" - slow down there but. It isn't 2012 anymore. "
So MLB?
"So we do 7 teams instead of 8?

And what they play one game to determine who gets to play in the next round like baseball?

You do a 7 game series you are only extending the season more when decreases the off-season. "
You dont get to complain until every team (or at the very least 7 of the 8) in the metro finish at 90 pts or more
"> year before in 2015 the entire central division got 90 or more points but some teams still missed when they probably should have made it over Pit who was a complete waste of a spot that year

"You are that guy, and yes you want to be that guy. You cannot not be that guy."
"You mean to say that you didn't enjoy the tire fire that was the Canucks (#7) vs Flames (#16) series...

Nothing says quality playoff hockey like Lack vs Hiller."
Maybe more people in the West should watch hockey so there’s more people to bitch. 
Caps are in a nightmare
You've got it this time bby ;)
How would the current 1st round matchups be any less good?
"Wait, finishing second or third in the central makes you punch above your weight in the first round?

Those teams play each other. That's not how punching above your weight works."
"You and I have discussed this before, and I still haven't changed my mind :p

I think Nashville would tear us apart."
As is tradition
"Divisional playoffs are simply about one thing, and that's time zones.  The reason the 80's were divisional is because Detroit and Toronto were potentially linked with Vancouver and LA come playoff time.

You're right, rivalries happen no matter the format.  Teams can meet once, and it gets crazy.  Teams can meet 5 years in a row, and it gets boring.  You never know.  Teams can meet up multiple times regardless of the format too.  Van/Chi, Was/NYR, year after year, even before realignment.  One series people loved, the other they make fun of.

The same way the cap isn't primarily about parity, divisional playoffs aren't specifically about rivalries.  If there's parity, if divisional rivalries spark, it's a byproduct."
"True, but the NHL wants to create more intense rivalry, through playoffs competition, to give even more weight to regular season games between rivals.

I don't have the stats in front of me, but I assume rivalry games are more popular, even within division, than non rival ones. "
"Nothing is perfect.
"
70s right ? Or was that just the 1-16 experiment
"Not really

For example, if you look at the West standings right now. Nashville would play LA and Dallas would play Vegas.

I'm saying in that scenario, just do top 4 in each division.

But for example if the Avs take the last wildcard spot from LA, then just keep it as is because there's 5 central teams."
The owners too
Western teams do that anyway. 
Can Confirm. Two years ago when Preds played Ducks and Sharks both 7 games back to back was their downfall. Too much travel and it showed in the end. 
"And when fans of Pacific division teams are at work until 8 or 9 EST and can't watch half of the games.

And when Eastern fans want to go to bed but the games are on until 2am."
Or go nuts when two rivals face each other for the cup. Would be glorious.
I meant easy with alignment and playoff formats.  Almost all close together.  One time zone.  Sorry.
"Yeah, they have the best system since byes can't really be a thing. Over half the teams getting in makes the regular season seem like a bit of waste"
"The top league in Finland does a Best of 3 wild card round with the 7th-10th seeds.

I could see that happening at some point if the league wants to expand the divisional playoffs and allow in 5 teams instead of 4."
The Metro last year blew the Central out of the water with how competitive it was down the stretch. 7/8 team were all competing for a spot excluding the devils. The Central had Colorado and Stars our of contention from the getgo.
"Entire division got 90 pts

Pit was a tire fire that entire year under Johnston and got bounced in 5. They never looked they belong in the playoffs that entire series against New York.


Where was I wrong in that assement? The Avs, LA, even Dallas would have been a better team than Pit in that given year.

The playoff format never got any attention until the west wasnt the conference getting the shaft in it all"

The guy above is is trying to say that you have to player a harder opponent from within your division instead of a weaker opponent outside of your division.
"Sure it is. Look at last year for example. The Wild finished 2nd in the Central and 2nd in the West. Rather than playing the 7th best team in the West, the Flames, they played the 5th best team in the West, the Blues. The Blues finishing 5th in the West and 3rd in the Central had to play the 2nd best team in the West rather than the 4th best team in the West. 

The year before that, 15-16, the Blues finished 2nd in the Central and 2nd in the West. Rather than playing the 7th best team in the West, the Predators, they had the play the 3rd best team in the Central and 3rd best team in the West, the Blackhawks. The Blackhawks finished 3rd in the Central and 3rd in the West. Rather than playing the 6th best team in the West, the Sharks, they had to play the 2nd best team in the West.

In 14-15, the Predators finished 2nd in the Central and 3rd in the West. Rather than playing the 6th best team in the West, the Wild, they had to play the Blackhawks who finished 4th in the West and 3rd in the Central. This year was particularly bad as well and the Ducks got screwed as well because the 2 Wild card teams finished with more points than the 3rd place Pacific team; so 1v7, 2v6, 3v4, and 5v8.

If this shit was happening in the East on a yearly basis, there would have been a major uproar about it much sooner. Hopefully Seattle comes I to the league and this shit gets fixed. It is completely possible for a scenario in which the 2nd best team in the league plays the 3rd best team in the league in the first round which shouldn't happen in playoff seeding. Last year was close to that happening when the Pens finished 2nd in the league and played the BJs who finished 4th in the league in the first round"
"If the Kings are playing at the highest level they can, or near it, we win the West. I don't think anyone will beat Crosby and Malkin in a seven game series year, though"
"Yeah, that's a good point. Though it's kinda funny that the NHL leaves in the possibility of half the matchups being in disjointed time zones anyway, by having the potential wild card crossover. 

The East all gets the same start time no matter what, so that's a non-factor. And in the West, if Dallas gets Vegas and LA gets Nashville, you're gonna have wonky start times anyway. "
"Its was only 1-8 from 1994-1999

After 1999 when atlanta columbus and nashville were added it went to 5 team divisions and the top 3 of each conference were the division leaders.

Most people on this board think of pre-2013 as 1-8, but from 2000-2013 it wasn’t.

And i know in the 80’s it was divisional playoffs like it is now because my jets had great teams but could never get passed the oilers."
"The wild card system is only a temporary solution. They will go to full on division playoffs when the 32nd team will arrive to the league. When the division reform happened, they wanted to do the system already back then, but the GM's of the eight team divisions opposed it, because it gave the seven team divisions a higher chance of reaching the playoffs and hitting bonuses."

98 > 90&92

">Though it's kinda funny that the NHL leaves in the possibility of half the matchups being in disjointed time zones anyway, by having the potential wild card crossover.

Agreed.  They were thinking about Detroit and Columbus staying in the Central with a strict top 4.  The wild card is there because in the 80's, there were at least a few times when the 5th seed in one division had a better record than the 4th in another.  Enough teams and/or the PA didn't want that.  They come up with the wild card, which then sent Det and Clb running to the East, and Nashville can still play in California in the 1st two rounds.

It's a weird hybrid divisional/conference format.  Plus the Central teams still get bad local start times in the playoffs.  Games start at 8, 8:30, 8:45 CST, depending on what happens in the 7pm EST game.  That might happen no matter the format though."
I thought losing your 1C and some quick whistles is what did you in. 
The NHL is too prone to random outcomes in short spans because of how relatively little the stars get to play. Bums shouldn't be given the opportunity to luck into first round upsets.
And before the division realignment the strongest division since the full lockout has been the old Atlantic division.
I’m a Colorado fan? So you wouldn’t be in my conference. 
"They dont make the playoffs if they spent an entire season in the west. Only bottom feeders were the Yotes and Oilers East and the metro was a joke that year just look at goal differential. They played in an easier division Avs and Stars would be 100 pt teams in the metro that season

You could even look at their splits against the east if you really want to try and dispute that."
"I know ""playoffs are a different beast"" is a really overused saying but its very true. Im pretty sure we swept the rangers in the regular season and they basically kicked our ass in the 1st round. Matchups can really change once its playoff season "

"> They played in an easier division Avs and Stars would be 100 pt teams in the metro that season

Oh I have heard of this before!! Back in 2013 when we knew Columbus and Detroit were going to move to the East, West fans were sure that they were going to dominate in here. Didn't really end up happening, did it?"
"True, but I'd be surprised if more teams are successful in the playoffs against teams they are winless against, than against teams where they won 3/4 games and like 10 of the last 12.

Pretty big quick whistle. 
"A wildcard in MLB is already one of the best teams in the league by virtue of getting in to a very exclusive field. The regular season should matter. Teams like New Jersey, Columbus, Colorado, and Florida shouldn't be allowed to limp into a playoff spot."

I won't disagree.
"Well we all can't have a potential Hart, Norris, and Vezina finalist on our team with a superstar 1C and a bunch of semi elite players around them.

"Which of those teams is limping right now ? Because not all 4 are gonna make it,. Whichever does isn't gonna be limping "
"And they have a grand total of 0 series wins in East. So superior, I thought the thunderdome was supposed to wreck house?

And for that matter, Winnipeg went from having 51 points in the shortened season to having 84 points in their first season in Central. Oh my lord how you guys trashed the puny little pathetic eastern immigrant."
"It doesn't matter which one of those or the myriad other wildcard ""contenders"" make it, because they all have the same problem. They're mediocre teams with major flaws that have no chance of winning the Cup. Why even waste time playing them?

The fans deserve the best playing the best for the championship. They play 82 for a reason. It's complete bullshit that a team like Boston or Toronto can have their entire season invalidated by some low seed that won ten or more fewer games than them to begin with."
I love how you changed the goal posts when you were made aware they cost the Caps and the Devils their playoff spots and you swap the argument to series wins despite the fact that the last time the Devils have won a series Kovalchuk was still in the NHL and the last time the Caps have made it past round 2 a majority of users on this sub were children. 
"If they're they much worse of a team they should be a cakewalk in a 7 game series

"You changed the argument to hyperbolic western superiority when you claimed Pittsburgh wouldn't make the playoffs if they spent an entire season in the West and how Colorado and Dallas would be 100 point teams if they were in an easier division.

I then reminded you of the hilarious claims that Columbus and Detroit were going to **dominate** in the East and your rebuttal to that was the two **finishing as the wild cards?**

Conversation flows and evolves. Try to keep up, especially when you're the one directing the change."
"Bring up articles or actual posts saying they would dominate (IE be the top seeds in the Atlantic/Metro, for real do it....) What an overwhemling majority of people said is that they are likely playoff teams in the east which is a true assement in every regard as Detroit likely misses had they stayed in the central but they kept their streak for another 3 seasons due to the east being bad while BJs are about to make their 3rd playoff appearence in 5 years when we have to go back to 2012 and 2009 for the last time the Devils and Canes were a playoff team."
"I'm talking about fans on this sub, not analysts.

> Detroit likely misses had they stayed in the central but they kept their streak for another 3 seasons due to the east being bad

Ah yes, the Detroit only stayed on because East is bad. Then what's the explanation for Winnipeg having no difference at all between their last season in east and their first season IN THE THUNDERDOME? Did the magical mysticism of the Central superiority make them play exactly the same as the previous year?

> while BJs are about to make their 3rd playoff appearence in 5 years

Oh my sweet summer child.... Florida is going to freight train past BJ's and the devils and it's gonna be a crap shoot who's gonna take the WC2. There's nothing certain about BJ's playoff spot, it's actually hanging on a thread considering they're somehow playing worse than we are.

>when we have to go back to 2012 and 2009 for the last time the Devils and Canes were a playoff team.

Lol, we were bound to suck considering how our farm was literally empty, it happens."
"I wasnt on reddit then but even then there were more people suggesting Cbus and Detroit are playoff teams in the east than idiots saying they lead both respective divisons (especially with how dried u detroits farm system and team age) 

>Ah yes, the Detroit only stayed on because East is bad. Then what's the explanation for the Winnipeg having no difference at all between their last season in east and their first season IN THE THUNDERDOME?

Winnipeg stayed on the floor for a while in large part due to every central team adding a major piece for a number of offseasons

2013, 2014, and 2015 saw Dallas, Preds, Wild, Avs, and Blues add Seguin, Spezza, Johansen, Forsberg, Parise, Suter, Vanek, Stastny, Iginla, Tarasenko (came over from the Khl) while the Jets remained stagnant and the Hawks were in their peak form. Jets knew they would have to build up (in part due to the horrid Thrashers management) on top of being forced to play in a division that was having an arms race every offseason from 2013 onward"
"I think you misunderstood what I said. You've been taunting this idea that Central is so fucking good that if a team like Penguins had played their season in west, they wouldn't have made the playoffs. 

So it's only fair to assume that the thunderdome would fucking whoop the shit out of Winnipeg, but they didn't. Winnipeg played exactly as well as they played in east even though the rest of the division was having an arms race."

Petan would probably flourish somewhere with less forward depth for him to get the ice time to grow. 
Namestnikov in a Wings jersey would look dope
"Just about any player in a VGK jersey works for me. They're pretty jerseys and there isn't really any history with other teams that would make it feel wrong. 

For Sabres players, the Blues jerseys because I like the color scheme so much (please can we just change to the Winter Classic colors/old colors).

Also because of the All-Star Atlantic ""Tampa Bay and others"" team I'm oddly open to the idea of Eichel (and also Matthews, Barkov, and Karlsson) in a Lightning jersey.

Another also: Sharks was the only jersey I thought EKane would look good in before the TDL, so pretty much I can see the future."
Erik Karlsson in an LA Kings jersey. Idk I just feel the black style would fit his flow

Nice

"For sure. A stream, a forest line, a setting sun (could be the moon), and a shooting star make up a bear. That is baller as fuck.

50% of the time he scores 100% of the time 
"Holy shit, I mean the goals and points are one thing, but... that ATOI and shooting percentage is like, what?"
"45% is obviously not sustainable, but runs of 45% make 18% sustainable. What a beast. "
14 mins a game? Wtf..
And people said he couldn't sustain his shooting %
"The shots that are going in have been fucking lasers, too. "
"1 - jesus christ give him more ice time

2 - shooting at 46% seems sustainable"
Laine beams. 
So youre telling me its sustainable 
"He's been playing pretty good lately, I hear "
"I figured it would just read

Goals - A lot

/stats "
He still needs more ice time.
He also has 18 goals in his last 18 games. 
"I was think that his shooting percentage wasn't sustainable and when would it go down, but now I'm starting to wonder if it'll ever go down."
I first read this as 11 goals 17 assists but honestly I'm only 5% less impressed now that I corrected myself.
His moms/60 is also off the charts.
He's dece.
I think his shooting percentage is higher than normal...
"God damn, he is a beast! Those stats are crazy. 

Hopefully he’ll be able to grow a beard that doesn’t look like pubes one day soon and he’ll be a full package. "
He needs to shave that nasty shit off his face
he needs to shave that neckbeard though he looks like an idiot
All other time stick is break. 
A 3rd Lainer has to prove his worth
"Work smarter, not harder."
"Patrik ""3rd"" Laine. With fellow 3rd liners Ehlers and Stastny. "
His ice time is less a representation of him and more a representation of how stupidly deep the jets are. 
Yeah he's not very good. 
"Might as well call it 15, really..."
"As someone completely qualified to say so, looks sustainable to me"
"His career sh% of ~18% seems sustainable at this point. This, however, is well above that."
At 18% lol
So excited to see him for the next 10-15 years. Kid's a beast
"Lasers of ludicrous speed and ridiculous length. Of the league top scorers Laine shoots from the furthest. Even further than Ovechkin. 

This season Laine's average shot length is 37.5 ft while his Goals per 60 tops the league at 2.09: https://i.imgur.com/TFDdKVb.png
"
"No, he can't handle more ice time. He hasn't been very good against other teams' best players, although he has improved a lot in the most recent games. I think it'll come as he gets more experience. "
He plays better on the third line.. he is tired less and makes less mistakes. 
Yup and look he scored another goal.
Is 9 games a big enough sample size?
IMO he's quicker and better able to create space with the decreased ice time.
"If you watch the jets regularly you would agree he DOES NOT need more ice time. he has played so much better since he was given 3rd line minutes. He is faster, Hungry on the puck and makes less defensive mistakes. "
"And it has actually improved this season.

S % | 2016-17 | 2017-18 | Career |
-----|---------|---------|---------|
Laine | 17.6 | 19.8 | 18.7 |"
"This was counted mid-game, he actually has 13+6 in 9 games"
Not a chance.. 18 goals in last 18 games.. why the hell would he change a thing. He is a sexy beast. Plus all the moms love his beard. 
He looks amazing.. and will soon sign for 8 years at 10 Mil and make more money playing a single game of hockey than you do in a year
Obey the beard.
We'll give you Jaskin and a 1st
[deleted]
"If anything you almost expect it to improve as he ages, I think Laine could be the next person to crack 60 at some point. He’s just so young for someone scoring like this."
75% last night!
Hope to see him wearing Jets logo all that time (I can only hope!)
"He will be ""only"" 34, 15 years from now.

That is nuts."
I did not know average shot length was a tracked stat. Thanks for bringing that to my attention.
"I think he is making the leap we all know he will eventually make.  Time to start trying him for more minutes.  Obviously, the hot streak is boosting his confidence, but he is playing better all over the rink - moving his feet more and being in ideal position more consistently.  

He is now in my top 3 for players I want to watch (with Ovi and McDavid).  
"
"Yeah I don't know why people are so quick to assume it's a coaching mistake when the jets have plenty of other good players and this is obviously working.

The coach knows laine doesn't have an issue with scoring prowess, but you need more than that to line up across from the best of the best in the NHL "
He's looked quicker in the last stretch of games. I think that is partly due to his decreased ice time. One of those weird examples of addition by subtraction.
no but 18% Shot percent over 140 games is sustainable and a big enough sample size. 
No it's not. Your right and getting downvoted 
And that's only skating ~15 minutes a game!  
No. /s
Flair checks out.
"That doesn't really happen as much these days though, great players tend to walk right into the league at 19 and play as well as they ever will"
I mean it would only be fitting to trade a young Finnish goal scorer from the Jets to the Ducks ;)
we don't really need him to play heavy minutes right now. maybe come playoffs time
This is r/hockey where everyone knows more than all coaches and GMs.
"It's more than just quickness, he's been more actively fighting for the puck. I think what happened is at the beginning of the year the coaching staff said ""Hey, you're good at scoring. Lets work on your defence to make you a more rounded player"", then put him on the first line.

I think being on the 3rd line now, and having practiced a more conservative game has really helped him now and they just told him to do his thing.

All conjecture here on my part though."
"I mean, Crosby had his best seasons at like 22-24 even if they did get cut short by injury. Ovi’s best were his 3rd and 4th in the league. Superstar or no, it’s ridiculous to say a 19 year old won’t improve. "
Oh god don’t even joke about that
I can't believe you've done this
YOU WILL GET NOTHING AND LIKE IT!!
Can't lie. Laine on old schol Ducks jersey would look cool as hell
"I didn't say he won't improve, I just don't think you can expect his scoring to improve dramatically. He's basically being deployed exclusively to score goals right now, and I think the Jets are eventually going to expect a little more out of him in terms of defensive and physical play. That's where you look for improvement. "
"For Cam Fowler and some spare parts, if we’re doing the modern-day equivalent. "
Deal
Taylor Hall flubs a shot and still makes it a perfect pass. Give this man the Hart
Vatanen to Palmieri and a Maroon goal. Quack.
All I heard before the trade was that he'd be useless without McDavid but he has looked great in every game for the Devils. I hope he stays.
*pokes Grabner with stick* 
"He sucks at hockey, apparently. "
"Attaboy Patty.


Can't wait to watch those two in the postseason, I'm fucking stoked already!"

Someone is going to pay Maroon big bucks! I sure hope that team has a Hall or McDavid!
"Whenever the Oilers GM calls NJ, the Devils GM just immediately answers with a “YES” before a trade is proposed."
Wait when the fuck did Maroon get traded to the devils?
I thought Maroon could only play with McDavid and that’s why Chia could only get a third?
"5 points in 4 games and only for a 3rd (rip dudek)

*There goes my sHERO*

"
"Damn, Maroon looks dope in the Red jersey"
This pleases me.
Hall faked a slap shot knowing damn well it’d get redirected straight to Maroon’s forehand. Guy is fucking dominant. 
I have to say its weird seeing Maroon score a goal and not have a big celly with both arms up
"Guess like they found their game again in New Jersey. Nice job at getting him at the Trade Deadline Devils.

Sorry Oilers fans."
Wow was that Palmieri and Vatanen with the assists?  A little former Ducks party going on over there.
Is he the first since Kovalchuk to wear #17?
who would've thought that Hall was Maroon's one true Mcdavid

"He is a not bad at all player on a fanfuckingtastic contract.

"Yo, I think it twitched"
He's been close on hitting the back of the net more than once at this point. I'm sure he's feeling super frustrated about it. Hopefully it happens soon.

"It happens every year the Oilers sell, our players go for scraps and then light it up. Unfortunate we can never get any value."
Maroon has a history of playing well with good players. 
We got more than we gave away for him and this one is a loan...
Playing with the hottest point getter currently in the league probably matters.
AND A PROSPECT(ish).

"Why? There's a pretty significant chance he just goes right back to edmonton after this year.

He might want to stay, but he expressed strong interest in returning. I personally hope he finds a good home here."
Why? We love Patty.
Lol why? 
We feel the same way when Rico scores for you guys.
That fact that we got noeson off wavers still amazes me
It got Kunitz into the Olympics. 
"Yeah. He's been playing mostly bottom six minutes with Boyle and Coleman or Noesen and Zajac, but hes looked great on the PP with the top line. He's a fun player to watch. "
I still can't believe we retained salary on that one.  Boneheaded in retrospect for Bob Murray.
He's been in the majors for so long.
I see what ya did thur.
That and former Penguins employees.
"Sometimes the superstars needs someone like that, stacked lines don't always work, look at Kunitz 4 Cups for being an amazing supporting player"
"It was a smart move by the Oilers. Don't let 5 games with a new team trick you, he's still Maroon. "
Just on the powerplay
Nico and Bratt play with Hall. When its not Bratt its Palmieri 
"And a contract the other way, you mean."
"It was more of just a joke, I don't know why so many people got so upset about it. It was just funny that both players were from Edmonton, and believe it or not, most of Edmontons sub did not like Maroon at all this year, as well most Edmonton Fans thought the 1 4 1 was a great trade. Of course now they will pretend that they are really happy for these players but in all honestly it's just a cover to hide their envy."
But it feels oh so right for us now 
It was all due to cap juggling from bouncing guys to the AHL because we were at the ceiling with people coming off of LTIR.  Perfect storm of screwed and mismanagement of assets.  I'm glad he's doing well elsewhere.
"He's a great player tho. Like, he does all those little things that don't show up on the score sheet... and he also scores a lot."
[deleted]
"Maroon is great when he’s giving a full effort. It’s whether or not you get a full effort from him that is sometimes the question. I suspect you’re seeing 100% Maroon right now because he’s just moved to a new home, has nothing but hockey to concentrate on, needs to impress his new team, and it’s a contract year for him.

We wanted to keep him here, but he wants like 5M we wanted to give like 3M. So, if you wanna pay him 4-5, enjoy..."
"Absolutely. Maroon knows his role, and when he's on he does it well. Goes to the dirty areas and bangs in tap-ins and rebounds. "
"I can't say much for their play outside of Anaheim, but comparing Kunitz and Maroon when they were here is definitely an insult to Kunitz. He may not have been driving the bus, but he was much less of a passenger than Maroon was. Maroon is closer to a Penner than he is to a Kunitz."
"Yep. In the end there were/are still questions as to whether we would re-sign him at all.

If he wants to come back on a good deal, great. If he doesn't, then there is nothing wrong with the third we got for him.

Maroon is good at what he does, but I really don't think we were getting a 2nd round pick from anyone for him."
"Maroon's been a fan favorite basically since he got to Edmonton. There was criticism of him this year that he couldn't seem to get anything done without Mcdavid, but that doesn't mean we ""didn't like him at all"". Most Edmonton fans would be happy to have him back on a decent contract.

As far as the Hall trade nobody thought that was a ""great"" trade, many were happy with it though. Mainly because: A) we needed defense very badly for years and had plenty of young, skilled forwards. And B) a lot of Edmontonians found Hall very unlikable as a person. They put up with him because he was a good hockey player but many saw him as an immature, selfish, whiny little shit. He definitely seemed to mature a lot during his last year here, but it was too little too late by that point. Many people in Edmonton were just happy Hall was gone, Larsson was just icing on the cake."
What’s with Leafs fans always shitting on the Oilers? It seems like every chance y’all get you guys take a shot at us.
"It’s kind of a win win then. It just means you guys have a lot of talent, and it gave noeson a chance to crack the lineup of a team that needed him"
"Eh, still won gold"
Where did you hear that he wanted 5M? That sounds like a load of bs
"Hrm. That sounds like a load of shit to me. Like, everything you said. "
It's almost like playing for a team that matters at this point of the year is motivating
And in a playoff spot now.
we haven't had that ever since Boyle disappeared. we basically got an better boyle 
"I'm not comparing them as players, I'm saying they fill similar roles, they aren't superstars themselves but they play well with them, not everyone can play with a McDavid or Crosby and succeed no matter how easy everyone says it must be"
">Many people in Edmonton were just happy Hall was gone

This is like, the definition of ""oilers fans deserve the oilers"""
Well how much does Maroon want?
"Perhaps. Maroon was dog-shit in October, then average in November and December. And now he's lighting it up on the Devils.

He also lit it up for us when he was first traded to Edmonton... and he kept that momentum going through the 2016-17 season. In my opinion he looked complacent at the beginning of the 17-18 season. And I don't think a guy like Maroon can really afford to be complacent.

I'm sure he has at least 3 or 4 more good years of hockey left in him. I'm not ripping the guy. But Anaheim had reasons to trade him, and Edmonton wasn't prepared to spend top dollar for him either - for good reason.

He's a good trade deadline acquisition though. He can be a difference maker in the playoffs. And he has a really good infectious attitude."
"But, Boyle did score, too, which was nice.

In defense of Boyle, he's definitely got bigger personal issues going on. His son had surgery done right before the all star game. Which completely coincides with when Boyle's game dropped. My guess is he's been distracted with much of the after care. In a perfect world, we give Boyle personal time, but he was willing to play and Devils had trouble filling spots because of injuries."
"I mean, Penner put up better numbers with Getzlaf and Perry despite being one of the laziest players in recent memory. Maroon's a mediocre player who's made a living leeching off some of the best players in the league. If that makes him an ""amazing support player"", so be it, but it doesn't make him a good player."
"meh, I know r/hockey likes to act like the sky is falling, but I like the team we have now more than any we've had in the past 15 years. Aside from a terrible PK and PP, they're a really good team. I'd like a change with special teams coaching, but everything else can stay the same as far as I'm concerned. Including Chiarelli.

People act like because Mcdavid is on the team if the team isn't a cup contender then the whole organization is a failure. Lemieux missed the playoffs 5 out of his first 6 years, in a 21 team league. "
At least 1?
"wtf are you talking about man, i'm not saying maroon is amazing at all, i'm saying certain players can compliment superstars well, I am not comparing Kunitz and Maroon as players, just stop"
"""Don't tell me Maroon is a good hockey player."""
"Ill argue for a long time (and probably will) that PC has made the team demonstrably worse over the last 2 years. 

However, thats not the point of the discussion i was bringing up. Anyone who actually thinks the Hall trade was a positive simply due to the fact that Hall was no longer on the team, is incredibly ignorant of what has happened over the last 4 ish years, and deserve what management has given them the last 15 years (hence, oilers fan deserve the oilers)  "
He had offers from the Oilers on the table. I would ignore Dr_Marxist
"I dunno I just see multiple people bringing up Kunitz in the comments and I think it's a stupid comparison and I wanted to vent. Sorry if you weren't comparing them as players but that's how I saw it and I felt like commenting, my bad."

Hopefully he’s fine, and here’s to hoping he will dominate the league for seasons to come. "

"Get better Boeser. 

Use this time to heal up your wrist too so you can come back 100% next season as the monster we all know you are."
"Holy crap, at no point did ""career ending"" even cross my mind!!

I am very much looking forward to many years of Boeser and Barzal competing with each other. Never want to see a player go down like that. "
">Not career ending injury

Is this the literal doctor from Arrested Development?"
"Damn, rest up pal; thanks for givin' er. See you next year"
"Brad Richardson fractured his fibula and tibia at age 32. He's recovered and playing in the NHL to this date.

Mikkel Boedker almost died after he ruptured his spleen and kept playing for Arizona against Winnipeg. He was 26.

Boeser is 21, there aren't many injuries that are career ending for a 21 year old. Pacioretty broke his neck ffs."
"Has an injured player ever won the Calder?

Asking for a friend"
Does anyone have a video of what happened?
"Jesus Christ!! I'm so sorry, Nuck fans 😣😣"
"Love Boeser, love the way he plays, love that he's a Minnesota boy. Hope he's ready to wheel, snipe, and celly again real soon. "
Holy shit. Get better soon you beautiful bastard. 
"despite the Canucks being, well, bad, Boeser was a lot of fun to watch when WPG played VAN. Everytime he touched the puck I got the nervous feeling we were gonna get scored on. So much raw skill. I hope he gets back and to form by next season. I haven't enjoyed watching another teams player this much ever "
"That ""not career ending"" qualifier makes this headline scary. That collision with the bench door looked like it hurt like hell but I had no idea it was even close to being career ending.

Makes me shudder to think what could have happened. Hope it doesn't affect him long term."
Hitting your spine on the corner of a door is never a good thing
Is there a gif of what happened anywhere?? I feel completely out of the loop here...
"damn, really feel for canucks fans, stay strong!"
How reliable is this source? It isn’t verified by Twitter.
"hm, this guy is one of my favourites in the league to watch. Hope he recovers well for next season."
Probably fractured his pelvis or something along those lines. It looks like the corner hit right at the top of it/base of his spine. 
That's awful.  Hopeful for a speedy and complete recovery.
Sad news but thank goodness he is ok. Never fun to see things like that especially when he is one of the few shining lights of the franchise right now. 
Just saw a video of the impact. That can definitely be career threatening if you hit a certain way or hard enough. God that looks like it hurts Hope he's not too bad 
"I'll take it.. He was nursing a wrist issue anyways.. Rest up Prince Charming, we'll see you in October! "
Fire up your Virtanens!
"Just when you thought nothing was worse then being a Habs fan...sorry Canucks fans, hope he’s fully recovered soon"
"Reminds me of Gomez in Alaska, ended up with a broken pelvis. Hopefully it's not even that serious. "
Brock Boeser is going to be a machine out of the gate next year. The Canucks will make the playoffs and he'll be a 2nd team all star.
"I'm an Isles fan, but I've never held clutterbuck in very high regard, but it's really hard to blame him for this one. It was a clean hit and terrible timing that door was open. I hope Cal has enough class to do right by Boeser"
"Oh my god this is the first I'm hearing about him being injured?! What the hell, career ending? What happened?

Sorry Canucks fans, I was enjoying him being a bright bastion of your futute. The comparisons between him and Matthews were very justified, and I still hope they give him the Calder after this season.

_/"
Sorry Nucks
"how the fuck did this happen?

and when?"
Glad to hear that.  When I saw the hit I was worried he dislocated his hip or something.  I think that was what all but ended Bo Jacksons career.
"I don't get how the door openings are still, to this day, not padded. The top of NHL boards around the bench have an air cushion (essentially a hollow piece of hard rubber to absorb impact), why not put something like that on the edge of the doorway? It wouldn't need to stick out, so it won't deflect a puck.

In this case, it may have taken this from serious injury to serious bruise."
dodged a bullet there. 
That was scary to watch last night. Honestly never thought it could be career ending - he is so young. I hate to see him miss the rest of his rookie year though. I hope he comes back strong next season.
Just give Barzal the Calder then
“Everyone in here reacting to the words career ending. Make sure all future tweets regarding injuries say not career ending. It sure does get the people talking!”
Unreal. What shitty luck. It didn’t even look that bad. I guess it could’ve been worse though? Sorry Nuck fans
Here comes the attrition of the long NHL season. It always seems that great players get hurt more often in March and April. 
Just fucking end me already
Someone tell the entire stadium that it was clean and that booing makes them look stupid.
Did anyone really think this was “career ending” nice click bait by that twitter account
Hope he gets well soon
"Boeser is awesome. But, Barzal has had the better rookie season. 
It was close (and could have gone either way) until Boeser hurt his hand. 
The hand may or may not have had anything to do with it...but Barzal didn’t blink, and Boes slowed down.

Boeser would have had to gotten to 40 goals to have a shot. That was now unlikely even before this latest injury (not impossible though). "

Thank the fuckin lord 
"I play beer league, lowest skill level. Last night one of the side doors came open right in front of me and I stopped and started yelling for the refs to kill play. Several folks on the ice got it but a few people didn't understand what the big deal was.

That's the big deal. Goddamn. Hope Boeser's better soon."
"This thread title caught me completely off guard. Didn’t realize it was potentially that serious. Here’s hoping for a speedy 100% recovery, the league’s a better place with him in it."
"Damn.... Hate to see any player go down, especially one that was playing as well as he was. Hope he's okay and he makes a great comeback "
"This is such a misleading title, the tweet says “not career threatening”. They mean the same thing but they don’t and you knew it "
"For something that seemed so... basic... I don't mean the impact, I just mean the whole chain of events.. It's terrifying to think it was this serious.

I REALLY hope he heals up 100% and comes back next season to dominate. "
"Hate to see anyone go down but 2/3 of the top rookies for the Calder are our for what looks like the rest of the season, wicked disappointing. It was Barzals no matter what really but shit still sucks "
"Really hope he makes a good recovery. Such a bummer he was 1 goal away from 30. I suppose now with our best scorer out for the season, I guess all we can hope for is losing some more games and *maybe* getting that first overall pick.
"
"Damn, Brock Boeser nearly became a what if there"
that sucks. he was having a stellar year too. i feel for him
Dumb dumb here. What happened to him?
Says 4-6 weeks on the score
Wait wtf happened? Just saw a blurb he was injured. Nearly career ending?
"Damn this sucks, this kid us electric and a class act. I hope he recovers and kills it next year."
"Nucks are my 2nd team, hope all is well with my boi!"
"Why can’t the Canucks have nice things? Rest up and rek bitches in fortnite, Brock."
"Well, I guess I'm done watching hockey this season."
">Not a career ending injury

Did anyone even speculate it would be?"
"Hope he is alright, he was lighting it up for the Canucks!"
Called it...close enough
"being back injured myself, watching boeser crash into that doorframe almost made me vomit. I truly hope this kid suffers no longterm effect from that horrible incident. (not a canucks fan)"
"i've never seen the ""they're ok"" tweet cause more of a scare than the injury itself

this was never career threatening"
He's one of the reasons I don't even hate the Canucks anymore. Hope he gets better.
I'll say it again. The door and surrounding needs to be made out of softer stuff. That 4' section of boards doesn't have to be true. Keep the inside of the door/boards solid so it can latch closed as normal but the side facing the ice should be a plastic shell over closed-cell foam that smushes if this happens.
"Seriously, I'm so sorry for all you Canucks fans and for Boeser.  Literally the worst luck."
"Uhm, not a career ending injury? Was this a thought ever?

EDIT: What's with the downvotes here? One of the top voted comments is literally discussing this exact same thing."

Clutterbuck destroyed him
They better put an asterisk next to Barzal for the Calder because we all know who truly deserves it.
Congrats Matt Barzal on your calder win
He dived anyways
"Stick tap to that one, bud.  Let him rest up that busted up wrist/hand as well from earlier this season."
"Thanks, classy response."
"he's had so much bad fortune around him with people having accidents, injuries or health issues. I really hope he's not cursed. Here's to hoping that this is his worst injury of his long career. "
"The fact that they needed to clarify that is scary as hell. I really, really, hope that time will be good enough to let him recover and he won't need surgery or anything like that. "
"It didn’t even cross my mind that it could be career ending, even though it looked horrible. Wishing Boeser a speedy recovery."
Thanks captain obvious
crossed my mind immediately when his back hit the door...was honestly very happy to see it in the title.
"didn't cross anyone's mind, it's in the title purely for clickbait, which is ridiculous"
It for sure crossed my mind. He got hit in the lower back under the pad by the corner of the door. I was afraid of severe spinal damage. I was happy when he started moving his legs. 
"And Chuck ""Bonafide Stallion"" McAvoy will be there standing in their way."
"""Not a career ending injury....

Tyamkin says sorry about Richardson
"> Brad Richardson

Pacioretty breaking his neck was the scariest thing I've ever seen as a sports fan. 
Fractures have relatively straightforward recovery paths. It's the soft tissue injuries that derail careers.
Letang had a stroke and he's okay
"While true, back injuries can be extremely serious. And though he'll heal, even if this is just a deep bruise, he could be forever effected by it."
"On the flip side, I fractured my tibia and fibula at age 21 and never played I  the NHL again. "
Benn broke both of his hips and had to get surgery on both. Hes going at like 80% steam now but hes still playing
Dude you don't even know what's wrong with Boeser. How can you say he'll be fine?
"Barzal will win the Calder,

and Boeser was only 1 away from 30... that sucks

He'll be back and better than ever next year"
Unless Barzal starts purposely shooting the puck in his own net he has it in the bag
Barzal ran away with it a while ago
I think Kovalchuk missed the end of the season and still won it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8l-jIiht50
"Boeser was far and away the main reason I tuned into most games this year (whereas last year I admittedly missed quite a few).  In the grand scheme of things though, just glad he's going to be alright. Open gates and stanchions make me nervous for these guys."
"He doesn’t belly that hard tho.

Edit: celly"
I think that's something Canucks fans have held on to during these games this past season. Watching Boeser take the puck was always exciting. It'll be interesting to see how the team plays without him while he's out. 
"The difference between spine injury and bruised butthole is a few inches, and spinal injuries are very difficult to diagnose.

Rick is a very reliable source for pretty much anything Canucks related and he's pretty good for league-wide stuff as well.
Arguably the best source for the Canucks over the last couple years 
Dhaliwal is very credible.
You do know that the blue Twitter checkmark means nothing anymore? They give it to those that virtue signal the loudest now.
Hopefully pelvis and not spine. 
"The small upside here, Virt has been playing great the last stretch so I'm excited to see him up with Bo and Leipsic.  
Virt and Lips already seem to have some good chemistry, excited to see them show their stuff."
I mean you guys have multiple cups in the last 50 years.. 
Lol the Habs don't even touch the factory of sadness that Vancouver is
Canuck fans hate clutterbuck but no one blamed him for that. That's about as clean a hit you can make 
Went into the open bench door lower-back-first. It looked bad.
huh? it clearly says its NOT career ending
"Boeser came in low to hit Clutterbuck, got stood up and sent into the open bench door.

Wasn't anyone's fault, just unfortunate. If the door isn't open, Boeser probably walks away with soreness/bruise"
"Clutterbuck sidestepped a hit Boeser went for. 

Boeser went hip first into the open bench door, and didn't get up"
Huh? It looked awful when it happened.....
"I mean that is definitely something that happens but this injury was in no way related to that. Dude went tailbone first into the bench door just as it was opening.

That's an injury in October, December, May or August. "
That is some mighty impressive confirmation bias.
"Not an ender, but I was worried it could be a nagging career long injury. "
"absolutely not, you are 100% correct"
Vancouver fans were likely the ones saying that. they love over exaggerating when it comes to him.
"It looked like it could have been a broken / shattered hip. 

Glad it is seemingly less severe"
Or... no doors at all. Anyone can hop a board. Even goalies. 
For a sharp hit to that part of the spine? It certainly could have been. 
"I think it was the worry of him hitting his tail bone/lower spine so hard, then not moving his left leg at all while trying to get off the ice, that freaked people out."
It was reported as possibly a bruise last night. WTF
"A fairly speedy collision with a sturdy sharp edge and a spine? Yeah, wouldn't be that big of a stretch to fear the worst."
"There was a slight chance, it was scary to watch live and then follow the updates live. He got launched back first full speed into a sharp corner and layed motionless in agony for minutes, then needed the help of three guys just to get up and hobble to the room, then had to be stretchered out of the building into an ambulance to go to the hospital. Potential back/spine injuries are scary "
I couldnt tell if he was standing over him taunting or checking if he was ok.  When I first saw it I had the same reaction you did tho
"nah, Boeser lines him up, Clutterbuck pushed him off. If the door was closed Boeser would have bounced right back up."
More like the open door
\* Barzal truly deserved this award
So the rookie with a 14 point lead in five more games played didn't deserve the Calder? What?
Barzal pretty much won the calder weeks ago.
I think it’s a joke guys. Knee jerk posted that in r/Canucks 
"You stole kneejerks comment, and even worse, couldn't even pull off the sarcasm...."
Charlie McAvoy
He already won it.
? No.
Have you seen the video? I don’t even know how to perceive that as any possible dive?
"...I'm sorry, but how the eff do you figure this is a dive? Clutterbuck did nothing wrong, but Boeser didn't dive, either.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8l-jIiht50&feature=youtu.be"
What do you mean by around him?
"When I first saw it, I immediately thought he broke/injured his tailbone. Not incredibly serious, but *incredibly* slow to heal."
"Yeah the fact it even needed to be mentioned is scary as hell. Hopefully he's back to 100% by next season, he's a fun guy to watch. "
They clarified it because he hit his back and he broke a bone near/part of his spine. It is a minor injury though.
"Oftentimes surgery can be a good thing as far as recovery goes with sports injuries. 

I know a lot of broken bone injuries heal much much faster after having surgery to repair it. But if its ligament/muscle damage... thats really bad. "
It literally said it wasn’t a serious injury.
"> It didn’t even cross my mind that it could be career ending, even though it looked horrible.

It was literally the first thing that crossed my mind. Because Canucks."
Lower back injuries. There's always that chance but you can more or less rule that out as soon as he moved his legs.
When I see a guy smash the base of his spine and not move his legs it actually crosses the fuck out of my mind 
It was clearly a lower back injury and he had to be taken out an a stretcher. I don't see how anyone could *not* have had the worst cross their mind.
"He left Rogers Arena last night on a stretcher, so there was a little concern in local media, but Vancouver media can be like a group a yelping seagulls in a 7-Eleven parking lot sometimes, so take that for what it's worth. "
How would you know that? We don't even know what the injury is. It very well could have been career ending.
"It definitely crossed my mind. Not as the likely outcome, but it's always a possibility when talking about spinal injuries. He hit that gate hard in an awkward position and needed a stretcher because he couldn't walk."
"Are you kidding? The armchair doctors were out in full force. Broken back, broken leg, broken hip, spinal injury, fire the entire Canucks medical staff for moving him because it’s obviously that serious."
"He literally finishes the same sentence with ""or even a serious injury"". 

It sounds like a bone bruise to me, maybe some damage to the spleen or something at worst. "
"""There's no other way to take that."" "
I gotta tell you you're taking his better than I would have been thought. His left hip socket is shattered so he'll be all right...
"He deserved a big and, and we gave him one"
I'm afraid we've lost him 
that was fucking terrifying and a huge loss for the preds last year
22 goals if you count the one on Rinne against COL. 
Give him the masterton
The best answer
The NHL does not shy away from ugly dudes lol
Holy shit. A+
"Give him credit, he's not as ugly as his on-ice play is.

Though, things less ugly than his on-ice play also include gangrene and the Pontiac Aztek"
can't fix his level of ugly. It seeped all the way down to his core
"Decapitation, Amputation, Ejaculation just to name a few."
"How did you translate ""I am groooot""?"
That injury was a complete fluke accident. 
I miss Red Heat on your team.
"No, just his son."
"Going through getting some of my vertebrae broken and the agonizing recovery process, and still not really being 100% even 18 months later really gave me a whole new appreciation as to how lucky he is and how hard he must have worked - and still works - to be one of the best goal scorers in the world. "
"That was bad, but not Clint Malarchuk bad."
"This is an awful example. Letang got extremely lucky, there are many degrees of stroke. "
Fortunately he can always sit down on Pietrangelo whenever his hips get tired
They weren't broken. He had bone spurs.
He's only out 4 to 6 weeks
In case anyone was wondering this is exactly what it's like being a Canucks fan
"> and Boeser was only 1 away from 30... that sucks

I mean the bright side is its probably decent for the Canucks cap going forward. There was most certainly 30goal and calder bonuses in his contract...

"
he also was screwed out of at least one goal in which he had the tip in and didn't get awarded for it. 
So *that's* why Laine didn't win it
"Yup.

What sucks is Boeser doesn’t get Bures record. 

Or 30 goals."
Not that halak has a prayer of stopping them if he did
I wouldn’t say he ran away with it when Boeser has more goals than Barzal. It depends on how you look at it. Yes Barzal will win it. But it was closer than just points. 
"depends if you weight in favour of primary points. take out secondary assists and there is only a few points difference, but with Boeser way ahead in goals. And with Barzal with more games played. "
"Kovalchuk didn't win the Caulder his rookie year, his teammate, Danny Heatley did.

    ---------------------------------
    | Kovalchuk | 65 | 29 | 22 | 51 |
    | Heatley   | 82 | 26 | 41 | 67 |"
Owwwwwww
"similar thing happened to me in high school. ended up with 2 compression fractures on my L1/L2 vertebrae. I couldn't get off the ice without help, let alone stand up. If the compression occurs in the direction away from the spinal cord you should be good. As others have mentioned in the thread, this looks like it might have been closer to the tailbone or L4/L5. Hopefully he didn't end up with any other damage versus just the bone which will heal"
YIKES!
Of course it was Clutterfuck.
"If i was you, i'd be panicking, even that low in the standings. He's a real gem and if he still wins rookie of the year I wouldn't be surprised "
"You say that but so many times you see ""out for season"" posts and there are a number of comments to a tune of ""Oh he his suffering from X and he is never going to be the same""."
"I don't know, minor spinal fracture sounds pretty scary to me.  I am happy to be reassured that it isn't career threatening. "
"Thanks, I hadn't seen this yet. Man that sucks, he was having such a good year, too."
Jeez that Clutterbuck guy is a beast!
"I think de Haan hit the point of the check mark right on the nose.
https://imgur.com/gallery/z3Kv7"
Hopefully neither of those.
They had 6 in the 70's alone.
At least it's not raining today. We got that going for us. :]
"Absolutely nothing wrong with what happened. It was absolutely horrible luck and timing, but the play was clean, Clutterbuck didn't come close to doing anything wrong here.

Glad it's not serious, it's just in a really shitty place that takes an obscene amount of time to heal. A few inches higher and this would probably be a totally different conversation. Being able to (sort of) walk away from it should be reassuring. But coming from someone who's been suffering from back problems for nearly 15 years, any injury down there just takes time and patience. The best thing is to not even attempt to get back on the ice for a few months, he needs to heal. "
"Yeah, but the fact it was a possibility? It's just not something you see often. Even season ending is pretty huge and can effect a player throughout their career. "
It didn’t look *too* bad. Certainly not career threateningly bad. 
"Oh I'm not saying that THIS injury was directly related to exhaustion. 

Just that these kinds of injuries, along with more standard injuries, seems to happen more towards the end of the season. 

This was a fluke injury for sure and could happen anytime during the year. But we might never know what effect the long season could have had on this incident. "
I mean it could be. I landed on my tailbone and since then things aren't the same as they used to be and I'm no hockey player. The good thing is I'm sure he's got all kinds of doctors and physical therapists helping ensure he'll be good for next season.
"It gets harder with a full bench. I hop the boards both ways in my beer league, but we only have 5 or 6 people on the bench and there's room. But if I had a full bench, I'd feel a lot better with using the doors rather than risking a skate going weird and cutting someone. "
Is no one seeing how insane that is though? I'm not sure a career-ending injury has ever happened to an NHL player this early into their career.
"Yeah he lines him up, and gets smacked on his ass lol. If you trying to hit someone usually the objective is to have the other player on the ice and not you"
"Even if the door wasn't open, he stepped up and got pushed off pretty hard"
"Not sure if this is just a troll, but most Canuck fans agree Barzal had already earned the Calder"
He stole this from a prominent /r/canucks poster. It was meant as sarcasm.
Which is no knock on Brock. He's had a fantastic year to this point but Barzal engraved his name on the award weeks ago. 
Brock's only hope was to score 35ish goals and hope the voters valued goals more but it was a long shot already. Now it's 100% over
No
He barley got touched and he jumped like 5 feet 
Linemates getting injured probably in weird ways probably. Happened to Baertschi and Horvat at least.
"I still remember a story from my 8th grade history teacher about the time as a kid he jumped into a shallow pool and broke his tailbone.

He said every time he sneezed it was the most painful thing in the world and he'd sit there shaking and crying.  People would ask him ""What's wrong?""  He'd reply ""I sneezed!""

Would not recommend breaking your tailbone and being around sneeze educing things."
Look up shazier on the steelers
Look liked more of his lower back to me but I just watched the video once. Maybe a vertebral fx?
I broke my teammate's tailbone in practice once. We were doing a hitting drill and he landed on his stick after I hit him.
"yeah it didn't need to be mentioned, it's purely clickbait trash"
"As in, not career ending. That's a wide range."
It's almost like people didn't bother to actually read the tweet or something....
"He wasn't moving or putting pressure on one of his legs much, if at all."
"Cal Clutterbuck is just an unstoppable force. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp3XfT67uPY"
Seriously everyone’s acting like physician after seeing a friggin replay. Just look at Macavoys injury. The play looked absolutely benign and he put for weeks. 
Every injury has the potential to be career threatening 
"Sometimes the internet is a frustrating place to try and be rational in, agreed"
Shhhhh...we don't talk about that lol 
"Is ""The Masterton"" code for ""five across the eyes?"""
Perseverance and dedication to hockey in the face of yet another hearing with the league.
"I read that as Mastodon and I thought to myself, 'his nose isn't THAT big'."
Rod Brind'amour would agree with you.
"Can confirm, ejaculation is the reason I don’t play in the NHL."
Well as long as the last one isn't anywhere it's not supposed to be... 
What do you mean? You just did
More like a complete Groot accident amirite
Who?
Glad to see you recover buddy. Hope it heals 100%.
"That's my point. A stroke can kill someone, but it's amazing that Letang didn't suffer any consequences from his. "
He could be DEAD for all you know!
And a Sens fan. One goal away my friend. One goal.
"If it's any consolation, you're going to be getting a better draft pick now than if he finished the season strong. "
We still remember the Jaime Benn vs John Tavares thing from a couple years ago for the Art Ross... It totally sucks when it's that close.
"I'm sorry that Canucks fans feel this way - from my perspective out east, you guys have had some really, really great teams in the last 20-25 years."
Wow that *sucks*
Seriously. I knew we would keep having the lead in a game until the very end resulting in a heartbreaking loss and I knew we would not make playoffs.....but I always just held onto Boeser's rookie first year. He held the lead (and of course in traditional canucks fashion) his amazing rookie year is over at 29 goals. I really wanted to see him get the 30th goal. 
He’ll hit 40+ next year.
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Except Oilers/Flames/Leafs fans of course
Coming close but never being good enough for the prize?
"I would say he did. Barzal put up several multi point games while Boeser cooled off a lot (whether it’s because of injury or not, who knows). Also I started watching some Islanders games and a lot of the points he gets come from driving the play himself. "
"Also worth considering that when you remove both of their secondary assists they're actually a lot closer in scoring.

A part of that is surely that Barzal is passing to players like Tavares whereas Boeser isn't."

and it was smooth sailing for Heatley in Atlanta from then on out.
Fuck me that hurts
"Yeah but there was nothing malicious, just shitty timing"
He is a beast!
I don't really panic. I guess I just try not to get too emotionally involved haha. We do have some new guys who have played well as of late. Maybe one of them will shine a bit more....who knows. Boeser really is a gem and I'm hopeful for his career. 
day's not over
It's in the forecast tho :/
"Yeah, I was worried about the lingering effects more than this year. He's our for the rest of the season, As much as that sucks, he should be back and better than ever next year"
"It wasn't though, seems like most people are just reading OP's clickbait title taken from the post and commenting based on that. 

Read the full tweet, it isn't even considered a serious injury."
"It wasn’t, the title is awful."
He got ragdolled and slammed his lower spine into the edge of the open door. That looked pretty bad to me.
"the ""not a career ending injury"" part is purely clickbait. "
"that’s because if they experience a career-ending injury in their first season, they don’t have much of a career and are easily forgotten... it’s definitely happened to promising young players. "
Just because it hasn't happened yet means it can't ever happen? 
"Kevin Colley of the Islanders broke his neck in 2006 just 16 games into his NHL career. His doctors advised him to retire, and he did. It can happen."
just because a guy never gets his d*** cut off on TV doesnt mean it can never happen
Yet.
"yeah but with Clutter doesn't really try to ""destroy"" people. He wants them to come back at him and take a dumb penalty. "
"He got pushed up, but then he would have gotten up and NOT the equivalent of stubbinf your toe with the power of Zeus."
"Yea definetely. Boeser is an amazing player and was a steal at 23rd, but barzal is better."
Good thing we drafted Senyshyn and Zboril over him.
"He had a fantastic half a year.

2018 has been kinda shitty. Sucks cause you only get one shot at a great rookie season. 


I’m just glad the Canucks helped contribute to Barzal playing no playoff games this year."
He missed the body fully and bounced to the side.. go back to Physics and geometry bud... maybe you just need eye surgery.

Now mine is just a bunch of floating pieces that act as a shitty DMZ between my flesh and my Sacrum. A decade ago, one of those pieces of tailbone decided to take a lil holiday, and migrated a bit. 

This resulted in a pilonoidal cyst, go ahead and look those puppies up. Had it removed, but that lil slut came back. Lucky for me it’s pretty tiny but it’s still a literal pain in the ass.

"I can't remember how it happened, but when I was a kid, I bruised my tailbone. I could only walk slow, and was very difficult to sit, if I even did sit, though all I do remember is the pain."
Broken sternum sucks too.  A friend's sibling had it and couldn't do activities that were more strenuous than walking for years
I broke my tailbone when I was in high school and had to endure jokes about how I must have gotten fucked really hard in the ass for a long time because it hurt to sit down.

Our trainers last night were thinking a bruise so I’m gonna guess bruised tailbone which fucking kills to do anything including sit.

Not being able to put pressure on is something that can be fixed.

If he wasn't able to move his leg that's a different story."

Last time I saw this stat (a month ago) only Eichel and Patty Kane spend more time with the puck on their stick. Barzal is really fucking good
"I’m living in New York and have been to a few Islanders games. Barzal is undoubtedly the more dynamic, exciting player, and he’s definitely a better playmaker.  

But Boeser has that rare incredible scoring touch that Barzal doesn’t quite have, and I’m ok with him not having somebody of what Barzal has because of that. We have Bo, who is a great playmaker, and we have some great prospects. A guy that can just score score score is such an important part of a good team. The future looks pretty bright to me. "
Still rather have Boeser.
"That isn't true at all. Of Barzal's 69 points 4 were secondary assists to JT, and the majority of his secondary assists come from taking the puck end to end, having a great zone entry, and firing off a great pass to set up another Islander with an easy assist. "
"Islanders only have 36 more goals and no requirement to play in your own zone.

"I've been looking around and can't really find much. Career-ending injuries typically happen to those later in their career, there aren't really any examples of a star having a one-off injury that ends a career at this age.

...hence the [second most upvoted comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/82fu3x/update_on_boeser_not_a_career_ending_injury_most/dv9p6og/) in this thread."
"So he clarified that it wasn't the worst injury in NHL history? That's my point, how did we get there?"
"Well he was a lot older, played for years and 11 different teams in the AHL and ECHL while never registering a point in 16 NHL games. To clarify, this is not to discount the man or the seriousness of his injury. 

It would make sense why he would step away from the game, the return is much smaller than that of a Boeser who's a 21 year old star."
But you also don't have to clarify every time it doesn't happen...
He got knocked on his ass dude lol how are you not seeing this? Pushed up? 
I’m sure it has nothing to do with playing on a team with 36 more goals and qpolicy of it being optional to ever play in your own end.
"Uhhh, Barzal might be better at picking up secondary assists, but there isn't a single person who would prefer Barzal on their team over Boeser. They're both exceptional talents, but you always take the guy who can score goals, that's the commodity that's hardest to find."
You guys also left Kyle Connor on the table for us and for that we thank you.
My sister had a cyst in that area too and it wouldn't heal because every time she bent or tried to sit down it would reopen. It finally healed after a few months and the damn thing came back the following summer. We had planned to go to Disney for her 21st birthday and she had to spend part of the trip in a wheelchair because the walking was too much for her. I felt so bad...those things suck.

I got one in 2004 from falling on my tailbone during a basketball game and then sitting on it every day during class.  I eventually popped it myself over my bathroom sink.  Wow.  Now it occasionally gets some fluid in there but it's never gone full mental again like the first time.
Why do you keep breaking your tail bone? Kinda odd thing to keep doing.
"Well, thanks for sharing."
"Man, I had those exact same issues as you. For me I broke injured my tailbone twice; once falling off monkey bars, and once somehow falling flat on my back after getting cross checked in the neck"
You have a thing for jumping off roofs or something? I've never heard of a person who has lost count of how many times they have broken their tailbone
Holy shit

"Pilonidal cyst. Worst thing of all fucking time and the surgery heals like ass. The surgery for it is apparently not as easy as it seems (or maybe every surgeon in Oklahoma is total shit) and a lot of the time doesn't heal well at all. I had to have two surgeries for nothing to really have changed (no change in comfort at all) and the wound still breaks open sometimes. The stupidest decision of my life and the docs/surgeons made it out to be nothing and a simple surgery, but it was fucked. He told me after the second surgery that his average is 16 months healing time. Before the surgery I was constantly assured I'd be fine and all good and life would be fucking dandy in no time. Never ever ever bother with this shit. Just deal with the cyst and live with a little bump on your ass-bone.

Edit: It's bittersweet to hear I'm not alone in this. Thanks for all your responses guys, the solidarity can be real for this thing. Having a hole on your ass-crack aint no joke!"

I figured it was a pinched nerve in his hip or something that led to his leg going numb, but as any doctor reading this could tell you, I'm no doctor."
If that door wasn't open he would have at least hit the boards fairly squarely. The door being open acted as a fulcrum on his lower back/hip.
"Yeah look at that dude in the NFL this season. Couldn't move his legs but it was just because of bruising and swelling on his spine.

His prognosis was ok i think. Still super scary when your entire livelihood is based on the use of those legs and suddenly you can't feel them."
"Right but with lower back injuries the difference between moving it a little and not moving it at all is a major difference.

"I had one of these too. Had it removed summer before senior year of HS. Those fuckers are no joke, they had to remove tissue all the way down to the bone -- 2 inches long, half inch across, and all the way down. They gave me a bit of kit -- a vacuum attached to a sponge and the sponge sat in the wound. That had to be changed every day at first, and then every other day, and it hurt like nothing I could have ever imagined. Took a full four/five months to heal completely. It did heal well, though, and hasn't returned in the decade-plus since."

It always comes back. I'm at the point where I'm probably going to see about having it removed a fourth time but it seems so pointless since it will come back and even the doctors say it will."
I have had a flare up twice. My doctors lanced it and packed it with gauze but never did a full removal. Last flare up was 7 years ago. They said after the third flare up they will look to do the full surgery but the recovery time isn't worth it if they can manage it with a simple procedure. This is in Canada.

Yeah but couldn't the same be said of any serious injury? Hell when Gaudreau took a skate to the neck last week if it was an inch further in it could have ended his career. Isn't that kind of the same thing really? The difference being obviously you can't see a stroke coming of course. Either way really it's neither here nor there and this is kind of going off topic. I think we're all just glad Boeser is ok and that he'll be back scoring goals in no time."
"It's a meme at this point and there's nothing you can do to change it so why bother. They even made a digital reproduction and showed it wasn't in. Also flames fans conveniently forget a lot of history about that nongoal, such as gelinas' arguable kicking motion, and the fact that it happened with 6 minutes left in the 3rd for the lightning to tie it. So yeah, it isn't really worth arguing"
What does depth perception have to do with there being white ice between the puck and the goal line?
"Race to the bottom. 

On the plus side, all these winger injuries give Goldobin and Virtanen a chance to play a scoring line role.

"Same, my understanding is it was a relatively new method of closing the wound that involved a plastic surgeon.  Weird scar but no issues almost a year later."
"My surgeon closed the wound first and it didn't heal right and got fucked up so I had to go the second time. The guy tried to close it again but decided to leave it open and let it heal naturally (thank god). The stitches imo is a worse way than an open packed wound. Anyway, I'm glad you're doing great!

"That was Virtanen.   

I don't have a physics degree, but I'd wager the majority of the damage was done upon impact with the door, and the light tap, while possibly adding a slight sting, was just just your typical ""atta boy"" after someone gets up that quickly.  

Or maybe that's the tap that led to Brock's season being shutdown (do I really need to add an */s* to that?)."
"No because that is a different degree of damage to one specific area... a stroke is cell death in a random part of the extremely complex brain.

A similar sized clot could cause you to not be able see again or could in turn cause you to not be able to control your bladder or do very little damage etc.

The degree of variation possible in a stroke is more diverse than the number of injuries possible for the rest of the human body combined and likely way more than that.

So yes it is far more luck based."

In 2004 that was definetly a kick. The bar used to be much much lower of what a kick was. Even the flames announces thought it was a kick.
"It's a discussion about how each has performed this year in pursuit of the Calder and then one person throws out, ""Still rather have Boeser."" Cool, good for you. That has nothing to do with the comments before it. It added nothing of value.

I said just the other day if Boeser could close the point gap a bit he'd have a chance given that he has more goals. I like Boeser a lot, but that comment served zero purpose."

"I'm sorry Sens bro, I shouldn't have said that. I hope my Cat bros and Bolt bros know that this Pens bro meant no disrespect."
That's cool and I understand. It's possible to be friendly and not call each other 'bro' all the time like we're all freshman in a college fraternity though.
"So it’s the [insert team]bro stuff that annoys you. Got it, PensBro."

I don't think I've ever seen that typed out before. Fuck the Pens."
That makes no Sensbro
Exactly. I can always count on my Sens bros to understand where I'm coming from.
"Woah buddy, we're all bros here, no need for that kind of language. I still love you though so don't worry. And if you ever feel down, just remember that your team is gonna be REAL spoooky in a couple of years!"
That is possibly the best joke to some from the whole [team]bro stuff.
Who??? Never heard of him?
He kind of looks like Conan O Brien. 
"Really?

Why hasn't anybody told me this yet?"
"I get the sense that this kid is expected to be a lot better than Ekblad, the last defenseman to be the consensus #1 pick going into the draft. I can't recall people talking up Ekblad like they're talking up Dahlin. I don't know, what do you guys think?"
Wouldn't be surprised if he struggled with NHL early on. He couldn't even get proper playing time in the olympics on a defensively weak Swedish team.
OP - This article was written in December... Why post it now?
"Hold the fucking phone, he is a defenceman? I've been reading and seeing highlights of this guy all season long and he's a D? well shit"
WHAT?!
Take's not hot. Take's never hot.

come to Poppa
Who is that?
Edmonton Oilers prospect. Expect him to crack the roster next season.
And the kitchen guy 
There's more to articles than headlines
"Makes me think of the same WJC championship where all the talk was about subban and Hedman and some minor talk about Karlsson. 

Subban and Hedman are obviously amazing players but scouts don't always get it right. There might be an even better player lingering in this same draft. "
"Without a doubt, he's being talked about being better than Hedman and Doughty, who were the most hyped d prospects in the past 20 years.  I can't recall another dman ever being this hyped. "
"I think he's getting talked about more because of him being a European player. The fact that he is currently playing against grown men and playing well makes him a ""safer"" prospect than any CHL player is. There's no guarantee he is a better player than Ekblad is, but he is likely to step into the NHL and be ready to play next season. 

He also is a more exciting player in terms of how he plays the game. Coaches, fans, and the media love players that can make plays they don't even think of. It makes him a more exciting player to cover. It's the same thing that had Chychrun drop from the consensus #2 pick in his draft year all the way down to #16 at the draft. People knew Chychrun was an NHL ready player who had all the physical requirements of being a Top 4 D-man, but he didn't have that exciting element to his game that makes him stand out. 

That said I don't expect Dahlin to be much better than Ekblad was his Rookie season. Puck moving Defenseman all tend to hit a wall in their transition to the NHL. They'll be effective players who don't look out of place, but they tend to settle down into more reliable players and lose their offense flair as they get more experience. Guys like Myers, Bouwmeester, and Jack/Erik Johnson all experienced this. Very few top pick defenseman dominate offensively in the NHL. Dahlin may be the exception, but I would set my expectations for him to be similar to those players in his career arc, albeit starting at a higher offensive level. 
"
He's definitely expected to be better than ekblad
OP is slowpoke.jpg
He's an 18 year old kid with more craters on his face than outer space. What do you expect?

OILUMINATI 
If Gordon Ramsey and Conan O'Brien had a love child... 
For example it being like 3+ months old.
"This happens with most articles posted on this subreddit tbh. The title is taken like a self-post and discussed at face value.

And it's not even the title of the article here, btw. The title is ""DAHL1N"". The user who submitted it gave it that trite post title."
"This is a great article that really paints a full picture of Dahlin and people should actually read it.

...but that *is* a terrible headline."
"Very true, we've seen it countless times where the defenseman who's supposed to be the best in the draft is upstaged by someone with a much rawer skill set."
I have been arguing that Hedman is the best D in the last 3 years. But yeah Defensemen are much harder to gauge because so much of the position is dependent on the little things that don’t show up in statistics and can only be seen by the eye test.
I hope you miss the playoffs and win the draft lottery :)
That Olli Maata you are thinking of and no he looks like a potato

We have your first round pick this year though ;)
I'm a moron
"Even if he's 100% with a couple games left I'd rather just keep him out. What's the point? Shouldn't risk his health for a nothing season. 

It'll help the tank. Well probably. The Twins usually step up big during injuries so maybe Danny gets a 40 goal season and we barely miss the playoffs. "
"Christ, he fractured the wing of his spine"
"It always scares me when players injure body parts I’ve never heard of. Best wishes to Brock, I hope he gets better sooner than they think and nets a few more hatties before the season is over. "
"The NHL seriously needs to make changes with the bench doors. It was a joke a season or two ago when during a Hawks game, one of the commentators wouldn’t stop talking about the doors after someone took a really bad hit on one. 

Either design them so they’re safer, or don’t let players open doors at all during play. "
ok why on *earth* did the trainers have him sit up and then walk off the ice? They got a stretcher after to take him to the hospital so why were they moving and bending him on the ice? Yikes.
His back just couldnt take anymore carrying this poor nucks team. God speed Boeser. Come back better
"That could have been a lot worse like, I'm no doctor but don't they fuse the plates in your spine if you get in a really bad car accident for instance? That'll end an athlete's career. "
God speed Boeser. 
I love the wholesome care that every fan of different hockey teams are expressing in here. 
Hope he recovers soon but if I am the Canucks I wouldn't bring him back even if he is healthy. I would shut him down and tell him to come back next season.
"So what I gleaned from this is ""minor broken back"", which seems a bit oxymoronic, but at least it's not as bad as I feared."
Get well soon!
"Fucking scary, glad it's not anything more serious.

"
so no long term implications. correct?
"In college I got hit into the bench door and it popped open from the impact. I broke 2 of my lower ribs on the left side and was out for awhile...pretty painful, that is for sure."
Baeser :(
"Phew. Sounds painful as hell, but honestly so lucky it's not as bad as it could have been because that collision looked awful. 

Honestly hope they shut him down for the rest of the season if he's not 100%, you can tell his wrist was still not feeling right over the past couple of weeks."
Ouch.
I think this is the same injury Derek Carr had last year?
"The transverse process is the same part of the vertebra that Steve Moore broke (obviously Moore’s was in his c-spine though). 
There was a basketball player awhile back that fell on his back in a playoff game and suffered the same fracture in his l-spine and only missed a short time too."
I think 4 to 6 weeks is this time of years terminology for done for the season. For playoff teams it lets them pretend he may come back to the lineup and non playoff teams it might kill the questions going forth
"Wow happy to read this for sure. Such an exciting player, I wanna see this guy dominate in the league for a long time to come. Sorry this happened to you Vancouver..."
Get well soon Boes! 
"Thank God he's okay, looked so scary. Hopefully they shut him down for the year, no need for him to play again this season."
"...entirely not the point, but does that graphic have the Agency typeface in weird caps? Random letters seem to be taller than others  


*[edit] like the 'T' in ""quality"", for example*"
Did he ever reach Bure's rookie goal scoring record?  Wish him a full recovery.
"goodness, this has been an emotional day "
"Not that this matters relative to his health, but does he miss out on extra money by just barely missing 30 goals (he’s on 29)? Or did he already earn the maximum during his insane All-Star weekend?"
Oh thank heaven it wasn't serious... Rest up sweet Prince!
"Damn that was brutal (the way he hit the opening, not the counter hit). Glad he's going to make a full recovery."
Hopefully this doesn't affect him in the future. I know Matthews had a back injury his draft year and it's always in the back of my mind.
"Oh well, he played well this season and probably will next too. It's not like we're contending for the cup or anything, worst case scenario he comes back after the season ending with us around the bottom."
"I think this will be an unpopular opinion, but what a fucking stupid play by the Canucks players at the bench door, imo, they should have been given a 2-min penalty BARE minimum. The play was CLEARLY heading in that direction, and the player (can't figure out who) was completely unaware of his surroundings, and made a change as the play was behind him. If he stayed on the ice 0.5s longer she surely would have affected the play and had a 2-min for too many men. Shit, lazy line change leading to a bad accident. KEEP AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND YOU."
"Hope Brock recovers to 100% ASAP, he has quite the story and is fun to watch.
-from a flames fan.

On a side note, why the hell do NHL rinks have multiple gates still? They could ditch one and then round the sharp edges on the remaining gate?"
"As a beer league player, not that there's bodychecking allowed, but this play is going to make me just that much more cautious about open gates.  Maybe they should be allowed to be used during plays. It's a pain but this could've been so much worse. Even some sort of soft or padded door, you could still wrap yourself around and get badly hurt.

Either way, hoping for a speedy recovery for Brock. Hard way to end an incredible rookie season.  "
Just in time for Pettersson and Dahlin next year :')
just vancouver luck
May he score more goals against Pennsylvania teams🙏.
He'll be back in time for the playo.... Oh.
4 weeks from now and the Canucks only have 2 games left. This is almost definitely the season
if he is 100% then there isn't any risk? 
Yeah I agree. Just shut him down for the rest of the season. He's never played this many games in a season before and was already injured before this. We don't have anything to lose.
">The Twins usually step up big during injuries so maybe Danny gets a 40 goal season and we barely miss the playoffs.

Looking at how Winnipeg ended last season and how they're currently playing, that might not be so bad."
Feel bad for you guys right now
Doesn’t surprise me. He fell into a sharp corner quite awkwardly. I wonder if there is any reason to have the doors from the bench’s anymore. I think I have been hoping the boards since grade 5 and usually if a player is taken off on a stretcher it is through the zamboni entrance
"It's actually not that big of a deal. Bryce Petty, Baylor's QB a few years ago, cracked two of them in a game and was back that same season. As it was explained at the time, they're delicate wings made of bone that almost entirely exist just to get broken or cracked."
...we have wings?^^^nice
"As a hockey player myself, I can’t think of any solution other than doors only being used during stoppages and players coming on/off the ice via hopping. What are your ideas?"
I think the NHL should just simulate all the games. It's simply too dangerous to play. Someone could get injured playing hockey and that is too much of a risk to take. 
My question exactly. 2nd time in 7 years the doctors let a player with a broken back skate/walk off the ice...
"After this and the excess of injuries the last few years, I think it's time for the medical staff to face serious heat."
"Can confirm, my husband broke many parts of his back and now has a mostly titanium spine that still leaves him in agonizing pain daily, 10 years post surgery"
Ask Clarkson and Horton about that
"They will fuse the vertebrae together if you rupture a disc in your back. A broken back sounds bad, but a ruptured disc is much, much worse.

Edit: this comes from someone with disc issues, I would much rather have a bone injury than a soft tissue injury. I hope he can come back from it without any residual pain."
That’s how you know he’s a special player. Warms my heart.
"Absolutely. Get healthy, then go into post-season mode. This was already a much longer season than an NCAA player is used to. No use rushing back for this season given we're way out of the playoff race anyways."
You never know with injuries but it seems unlikely yeah
Unlikely. Honestly the fact the tailbone is alright is a blessing. 
"oof, that doesn't sound fun"
Man that is scary. I'm going to be even more paranoid about open gates in beer league now.
"I have had the exact same injury, can confirm yes it hurts like hell for the first couple of weeks 😩"
Yeah. And Romo a few years ago. 
"Romo had a few lumbars tps, Newton had one from the car accident. They're pretty inconsequential.  

I'd be more worried about if the soft tissue was his spleen"
I think he is 5 goals short
"Yes if he hit 30 goals he would have gotten $212,500 bonus."
Flair checks out
really? poor form pal...
Dick. 
I think saying 4-6 weeks sounds better then hes out for season. 
But the Calder race!
The biggest risk factor for a back injury is having had a previous back injury.
There's still the risk of another injury that everybody else has. Would be protecting him from getting a new injury from playing in a few meaningless games.
He's already been nursing a wrist injury lately and I'd really rather not fuck around with anything potentially back related if he re-aggregates it and it affects his off season training. Although Brock is such a warrior I'm sure if the doctors give him the all clear he's going to want to play and try to hit that 30 goal mark
"It's great if the future core leads the way. If Stetcher and Hutton play like first pairing dmen while Virtanen, Goldobin and Horvat score at a ppg pace, then it is a good thing."
"I'd love to see goalies hop over the boards when they're pulled.....

Then you have players who are too gassed / injured to make it over."
"I think they would keep the doors, but mandate that they can't be opened during play. All live line changes would have to be an over the boards. There are direct medical units sometimes behind the benches, a la Rich Peverly. If you needed something immediately, it's definitely best to have access to the doors. 

Plus come playoff time, I can see it'd get annoying hopping the boards on tired legs when you could just have a convenient door lol. (Sorry Brock, that did look awful :/)"
"Sort of, lol. Some vertebrae have little bits of bone sticking out like wings"
The only solution I can think of (without a complete re-design) would be not allow door usage while the puck's in play.
Open them outwards instead. Only the strongest survive. 
"They could make the corners more rounded.  They could build them with some sort of ""crush zone"" either out of some high density foam or something else.    

The problem is it's just a hard surface with absolutely no give that's focused to a perfect 90 degree angle... so when someone does hit it, it's focusing all that force into a very small area.  

"
Opens up another risk of guys flying over the boards into the bench skate first. 
SARCASTABALL! 
"I mean, all I have is a basic first aid certification and I know that the big thing with a suspected spinal injury is ""keep them still"". I'm baffled. "
How would they know that on the ice?
"I'm sorry to hear that, and wish him the best."
What? They have degenerative back diseases
"That sucks. Were you bed-ridden for a while, or not quite that bad? "
"Agreed.
But don’t tell Steve Moore they are ‘pretty inconsequential’ or you may find yourself on the wrong end of a lawsuit;)"
it hasn't really been a calder race for about a month now. Love Boeser but got to be realistic
The amount of truth to this hurts. 
Well wouldn't the logic be to not play any player at the end of the season then?
https://zippy.gfycat.com/ComfortablePopularCoyote.webm
"I hop the boards all the time in goalie gear, especially when we get a delayed penalty."
"To his credit, [Don Cherry has been all over this for a while](https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/coachs-corner-somebodys-gonna-get-killed-gates-left-open/).  He's called out the league for the door hazard a few times now.  It's not the first time the question of [getting rid of the doors](https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-get-rid-doors-players-benches/) has come up.  Boeser is so fucking lucky, what a scary incident to happen yet again."
"They could also just design the doors better. 

There's no reason that they just have to be this abrupt hard corner.   Even just rounding them a little bit and increasing the radius would be a huge deal for some of these injuries.  Or build in some HD foam or something with a little bit of give on those edges

IT's when it's a sharp corner that's focusing all that force into such a small edge that's really dangerous. "
Great points. 
Yea I agree. Problem with that is it makes coming off the ice in a timely manner a lot more difficult and you’re gonna see more too many men penalties. 
"I think barring obvious injury where a player is definitely slower and can't/shouldn't make the hop over the board, this is the way to go."
"I think a simple door redesign would help immensely. I'm not an engineer, and just thought of this so there is probably someone alot smarter who can come up with something better.

But,

What if instead of a one leaf door, there was spring loaded double leaf that opened inwards in the middle. Like a double leaf swing gate. 

This way, plus spring tension to always force the door back closed, there will practically never be a solid right angle that causes injuries. Any impact would be at a better angle not causing the abrupt stop of body parts. 

EDIT: see shop drawings

https://i.imgur.com/agAxCR5.jpg
"
There could be a thin red line rectangle (like the trapezoid) where you cant open the doors if the puck is in it 
"in the last 8 years, there has been one injury from board jumping from a skate, oilers Gagner, 

in the same 8 years there have been numerous injuries from doors being open. 

in the last two years i can think of two. Chicago player and then this Boeser incident. i am sure there were more. "
"yup, lock the head in place with hands or device, check vitals, blankets, chat, wait... stretcher. Pretty simple!"
If there's a reason to suspect it (certainly there was in this case) there is zero rationale for not stretchering them off instead of having them sit up and then walk off. At worst it's inconvenient and you look overcautious. 
Thanks! Luckily he had no ambition to be an athlete of any kind
For the first few days yes I couldn’t really move but after that it was just achy like I had taken a knock and it was bruised if that makes sense. 
"C spine is a lot more complex. I wouldn't be surprised to know he has early arthritis or disc issues years after the initial injury. The lumbar spine is much more sturdy and has more space for the nerves comparatively. 

I also don't fault him for trying to get what he could out of the injury. Sure, it's not the most pure hockey move out there. But, he should have never had that happen to him and even just the emotional trauma of having part of your neck break from a ruthless sucker punch from behind playing a sport he probably loved could make him question whether he wanted to play again."
But the Calder Richard race! /s
"Even if you recover 100%, you still haven't played for months. Risk of re-injury is likely greater after not playing for a while. "
It's not rare for teams to bench guys and let some AHL players get some minutes at the end of the season.
Gives a chance for some other players to make an impression to get on the roster next year. It's possible that Gaudette and Gadjovich could play before the end of the year - similar to Brock playing some games last year.
Look at you Mr. I'm In Good Shape 
"If you round the corner of the door frame, you're still gonna end up with a pointy door. Idk how they will do it"
Was going to say this. They rounded the corner of the player's area glass after Chara hit Patches.  Lots of players have hurt themselves on open players box doors.  Why do they always have to wait for a high-profile serious injury to make preventative changes?
Also you have guys rushing to get off by throwing sharp skate blades over the boards towards people.
"I could see a rule change taking place to accommodate something like this. 

Add a ""crease"" extending 2 or 3 feet in front of the benches. A ""if you're in this crease and the puck unintentionally hits you you won't get a too many men penalty."" sorta thing. Would also prevent players from flying over the boards dangerously on a close change. "
"Just means more PP time for you, Patrick."
This wouldn’t prevent what happened would it? He would still push through the gate and collide with that inside area of the boards. 
Could cause weird puck behaviour on bank passes or clears. 
Now you have a door that swings towards the bench and gets in the way. 
"How many guys are getting on to the bench over the boards these days? There's a lot more hazard going that way with the rest of your team sitting there, compared to most of the board jumpers going towards the ice right now. "
He could move. There would be no way to suspect that unless the doctors had x-ray vision.  
"This is the correct answer.

It's also not uncommon to feel 100% after an injury but in reality you may be 90-95% and still at risk of re-injury or injuring surrounding muscles. "
For playoff teams but basement teams rarely do this.
"More like ""the guys on the bench pay no attention sometimes"" lol"
Yea ive had my pants cut by people who swing their legs over the boards in a panic. Not that fun. I think we just need to come to grips with this happens a few times a year and rarely results in serious injuries.
Basically a change zone similar to the one in box lacrosse.
"Pretty sure it already isn’t a penalty if you’re changing and the puck unintentionally hits you, but the guy you’re changing with still can’t play the puck until you’re off the ice. "
"When I watch the replay, and think about my new latest technology idea, id like to think his hip would NOT hit a right angle and instead hit it the door at much less damaging angle"
How so? The door would be flush and closed the majority of the time?
"NWHL has done it for nearly 2 years now, and no increase in injuries. not saying it wont happen, but if everyone knew that guys were coming over the boards they would focus on it more. "
"Oh apart mashing his back against an open door, laid on the ice holding his back, and struggled to get up. Yeah you're right no indication whatsoever, he may have hurt his back pretty seriously.

"
"I feel like ""hits his back, goes down in a heap"" = ""back injury"" is not exactly a leap. There were people on here speculating that was what it was when it happened, and I doubt most of them are doctors. "
Not to mention the weeks of not skating at NHL speed. You're better off getting some practice time in and starting in on your summer workout a little early. 
Guys are usually in rough shape by the end of the regular season even if they never missed time during the season.
Thanking teams do it all year.
I'm usually over the boards by the time they realize there's a penalty.
"I have had my leg cut more than once, but I play a lot of hockey.  Never serious."
"I never saw anyone get cut in all the years I played, but they could possibly make the benches deeper"
"I'm not at all familiar with lacrosse but I just looked up a video and yeah, exactly that."
"Ah nevermind, I misread your design, I thought they depended on spring tension to keep them closed. This could work, but it would only work for players coming off the ice to the bench. Players going from the bench to the ice would be hindered by the inside door. Even though most players jump anyways, it could still be inconvenient in that matter. "
I’m sure he was asked if he could move. The doctor isn’t just going to rush him off the ice. 
Ok back injury(soft tissue) and fracture are different things
Exactly.
I’ve played at prudential center and Barclays and they are actually much deeper in the NHL benches than most ice rinks the average player would skate at which could be why it doesn’t happen as often. 
"They technically have to pull doors open the same way, I think they would get used to it and it would be okay. Who knows though "
"Right but when he hits his back there is a risk of both, a soft tissue injury or fracture. Given that a fracture is a possibility they should err on the side of caution and stretcher him out. 

Compare it to the concussion protocol, if you get a big hit to the head you go into the protocol no questions asked. It may be a concussion or it may be nothing but we err on the side of caution and assume the worst, that its a concussion. "
There’s a risk of that with every hit
So you think it is unreasonable to think that Boeser may have had a spinal injury from that fall?
I don’t think it’s unreasonable.  i also dont think anyone was negligent in treating him on the ice. They wouldn’t make him do anything he wasn’t able to do
If you think there is some reason to suspect it is a spinal injury then you really have to treat it as such. In a spinal injury the wrong movement can result in permanent paralysis. So if there is any reason to suspect it could be a spinal injury then it needs to be treated as such
He was moving. Had he not been moving he would have been on a stretcher. 
Awkward roomies next preseason. 
"Calling Megan a prospect is a bit of a stretch.

No. Coverage is better now than it’s ever been. 
"Hockey coverage has gotten so much better and is probably part of the reason that a lot more people watch it now.

Obviously HD helps a shitload. "
"I don't usually notice any really frustrating close-ups that much. They'll do a close up if it's in the near corners because that's hard to see with the traditional wide shot, but other than that, if the puck is in normal action, 95% of the time the camera is in the normal wide shot. "
"The coverage is better than ever

I wish they'd start using the fancy slo-mo for replays during games, the one they use for the weekly slo-mo compilations. It looks awesome."
I feel hockey coverage is much much better nowadays 
Good God that fence climbing scene is painful to watch

Only thing that really annoys me is when they've got the behind the net angle going for the majority of a power play. 
"I don't mind how hockey is covered now, but I think I know what you mean. When I go to a live game (and I try to sit centre ice to see both sides well), there have been numerous times where I can just feel/know when a goal is coming or one team is about to get a very high scoring chance. It likely does have to do with being able to see everything, but it always surprises me when that happens because I almost never feel that way when I'm watching on television. It's why I always try to encourage people to go to a live game (at any level) because it really is a different viewing experience. 

With that said, I don't mind how they do it now because I think understanding/watching specific plays is just as important, and you learn to value what individual players do. Then I can use that and think about it in terms of a bigger picture, like when I see a live game. Or for a lot of people, it definitely helps them know when their favourite player is on the ice and I think it creates that sense of connection between fan and player. "
Is the changing around camera angles an American thing? I noticed it during NBC's olympic coverage alot more then I do on Canadian broadcasts. 
"What I would really love is the ability to mute commentators without muting the on ice action. I feel like they're great if you're new to the game but most of them piss me off more than Polak trying to clear the zone.

I love when I can just do the behind the net cam for the games on game center but wish muting the commentators was always an option because you miss out on replays and the clock on that angle. "
"I think if you were to actually log each of these cuts that bother you, and put a stopwatch on how much time the broadcast does not use the main wide shot during play, you would find you are grossly overestimating things."
I'm curious which market/network you watch? I don't feel like it's that much different than you describing it having been in Canada.
"I dislike it as well, but I understand why they do if. The biggest barrier for casual fans watching hockey is keeping track of the puck. With the wide angle shots that show most of the ice it's hard to identify where the puck is if you aren't used to the sport. In the past they've tried other ways of fixing this problem (like the glow puck) but none of them were received very well. By using lots of camera changes and closeups of players with the puck or sections of the ice they make it easier for casual fans to keep up with the action.

I think they could do a better job with switching to wide shots when the puck isn't moving. Things like breakouts from behind the net, battles along the boards, and defenseman at the point all tend to get closer angles of the play that don't show the action that's actually happening. In most of those situations the off-puck movement is what makes or breaks the play. The role of the commentators is to alert people as to where the puck and the play is. We don't need closeup camera shots to do it as well.

Nothing frustrates me more than watching a game where they have a close angle of a boards battle where the attacking team wins it, passes it to the point, the camera changes to an angle facing the point man where you can't see the net, and then the point man makes a beautiful deflection pass to a man cutting to the net or on the backdoor. You can't see the play happen and it makes it hard to tell a nothing shot from a gorgeous feed. We don't need a closeup of the boards battle. You can't tell who is who anyways when they are all tied up.  "
"Out of curiosity, do you focus on systems and strategies when you watch? Or are there other things you pay attention to more?"
"Hmm, I wonder how much of this could be regional. It does seem to vary a lot, so some areas could be getting it a lot less."
Yeah also this.
I call that the Anxiety Angle. 
"I love that angle! I feel a lot more invested, like you can really feel the threat of the offensive team. It's great."
"Yeah, this is exactly what I mean. I found that the added tension of knowing something's coming was a fantastic part of watching a game, and as exciting as the individual elements are, there's something about the suspense of how that upcoming scoring chance will turn out that, in the coverage I'm talking about, has been lost."
I think it's an NBC thing more than an American thing.  We don't have changing camera angles during the local broadcast of Rangers games.
"Depends on the game I'm watching and how into it I am. The more intensely I'm watching the more I'm paying attention to the overall game, the less interested I am/watching while doing other things the more I just watch for goals or other nice plays. 

I've never really had an issue seeing basically every player on the ice at a time unless some people are way behind the play, the only time it's an issue is when you have a player like Karlsson who does those sick 3 line passes from behind his own net and you can't really see the breakout.

What broadcasts are you watching with lots of closeups? I mostly watch San Jose and Toronto games."
"Ok, I had a feeling. It really bothered me during the Olympics and I don't remember having really seen it before watching Canadian broadcasts or locally done Buffalo broadcasts."
"San Jose is typically blacked out for me, but I found that last outdoor game with Toronto and Washington had, what was for me, a lot of cuts and close ups. "
"Outdoor games are almost always broadcast differently because the arena set up is different than regular arenas, definitely not a good judge of how hockey is actually broadcast. The WJC game was the same and had similar complaints."
"Yeah, I get what you're saying, that was the most notable game I could think of that had the examples of what I'm talking about though. I find it's not consistent even for specific teams though, so one Toronto game will be good, another will be really bad, same for Vancouver or Chicago or whomever. It would be really hard for me to say ""watch the next Winnipeg game"" for example, because who knows who will be the director on it? It's just something I can't help noticing when it's there."
"Yeah that's because they can be broadcast by different organizations, so if you watch it on sportsnet vs nbc vs whatever channel they have different 'styles'."
"Yeah, I'm up in Canada, and the more I think about it, this is likely a regional thing. When I watch other feeds, I don't seem to notice as much of the camera stuff I'm mentioning."
"Excerpt (sort of difficult since it's long, includes videos, etc. Dellow's articles/breakdowns are worth it though): 

> The problem with which Boeser supporters were faced was that the points gap between the two had kept growing. As of this writing, Boeser had 55 points in 62 games. Barzal had 69 points in 67 games.

> A new argument was required. Duly, it emerged: Barzal has a lot of second assists. Many, many more second assists than Boeser. As the argument goes, we should look only at primary points, not secondary assists which tend to be nothing more than cheap touches before a goal is scored. If we do that, the points race between Boeser and Barzal and, by extension, the Calder race, looks much closer.

>......If you look at Boeser's second assists this year, you'd be left feeling pretty comfortable that second assists should be discounted. 

Breaks down Boeser's secondary assists on PP then breaks down Barzal's very different type of secondary assists

> ..... So if you're wondering why Barzal has so many more second assists than Boeser on the power play,  it's a mix of two things. First, Barzal is generating second assists from zone entries, which Boeser hasn't done. Second, Barzal is creating a ton of second assists from seam plays.

> To me, Barzal isn't just freeloading, which is the usual rationale for devaluing second assists. It's an example of a player in a different role on a power play, which sees him put up points differently. The Islanders really seem to like having Barzal make that seam pass, which opens up the shot or the pass back across the front of the net. Similarly, they seem to like Barzal carrying the puck. The bulge in second assists comes from the way in which they choose him but when you watch the video, the second assists look critical to what they're accomplishing.

Breaks down Boeser/Barzal secondary assists at 5v5. 

> Essentially, as I look at the video of the second assists for Boeser and Barzal this year, I'm inclined to think that Barzal sort of roughly matches Boeser in terms of the low level touch assists you get by virtue of being on an NHL rink and semi-competent. His second assist totals crush Boeser's not because he's piled up a bunch of garbage second assists but because he's making plays that inject chaos into the game, which creates room for the next guy to touch the puck to make plays."
Subscribing to The Athletic has been the best $41 I've spent in a long time
"I dont get the discounting secondary assists argument, its stupid, especially in an era where transition play is so important, which happens to be a key strength in Barzals game. Sometimes the guy with the primary assist is the guy who just tapped the puck to somebody and the guy with the secondary assist did all the work. Stupid argument to me. Thank you for sharing, didnt catch this today. "
"This is the kind of thing that would get so easy to analyze with tracking data, if the NHL ever gets that far. Zone entries, and exits for that matter, are so important to every facet of the game and guys that excel in that area don't always get the credit they deserve. I'm sure they rack up more secondary assists as a result, but it would be great to have more data to back that assumption up."

"Do they set the schedule up to have inter-division games backloaded? I think that would make a lot of sense, not only to keep the playoff race tighter and more exciting, but also because you're lowering travel time at the end of the season leading into playoffs.

For example, californian teams playing each other for the last 3-4 games of the season would be pretty dope, or the northeastern teams, etc. It doesn't work with all divisions but it would be a nice way to lead into playoffs with a bang rather than the season sort of 'winding down' with games mattering less and less.

Obviously you don't know whose going to be in the playoff race when the schedule is set but chances are a few of the games will have very meaningful implications, and almost none of the pacific ones in this list seem to for actual division slots, there are a few with possible wild card implications."

One of my all time favorites. His NHL time was short-lived but I'm glad he had a nice career in the KHL too. That 2005-2006 season with Jumbo was one of the most magical seasons of Sharks hockey ever!
"A much better player than given credit for. He scored 28 goals the season *before* Thornton joined the team, usually on the third line. Was a KHL all-star in 2013-2014. Had he not had the double hernia problems he could have had a much longer, more fruitful NHL career.

Plus he put up three hat tricks against the Ducks in one season. They should retire his number just for that."
"Read about this dude's life, pretty inspiring stuff. He cried himself to sleep every night when he had to leave Moose Factory, and he said he would cry on his way back to San Jose after going home during Christmas breaks. Had to deal with racism along the way, some scouts wrote him off simply because he was Cree. To go from all of that to a Rocket Richard trophy is pretty awesome."
"I wonder if he has the record for highest % of career goals scored in one season (with some sort of minimum GP, or goals scored). 56 out of his 170 career goals in one year.

EDIT: Couldn't figure out an easy way to solve it but I did look at all the guys that have scored 50 goals in a season. He has the second-fewest career goals, and second-fewest career GP, with 170 G in 501 GP.

Hakan Loob only played 450 games (193 G), and Jacques Richard finished his career with just 160 goals (556 GP)."
"Cheechoo is from my hometown. I still remember it being a big deal when he was playing for Belleville in the OHL. I believe he scored 5 goals in their OHL championship game. It was dreamlike seeing him then drafted into the NHL by the Sharks in 1998 and then have a long gig with them. I remember listening to the radio when he scored his 56th league leading goal (just ahead of Jagr), me and some family cheered loudly. A true inspiration."
"There's a lot of ""oh he fell off lol"" whenever his name comes up, it pisses me off 'cause big picture, he was awesome. From a town of 2500, and 120 of them showed up just to see him get drafted. 

To come from Moose Factory/Moosonee, well: that's the Arctic Ocean, boys, that's the James Bay Coast. It means he had a little bit of a longer train ride than most. ""Cheechoo Train"" was a great name for him, he had to take the Polar Bear Express to even get out of Mushkegowuk, there's no road just rail. Everyone's pretty proud of him, I am too."
"Train train Cheechoo train, the Sens are gonna win today. Cheechoo. Chee chee cheechoo.

I honestly thought he retired years ago.
The train ride ends
"inb4 'it was all big joe'. cheechoo's career was derailed because of injury. Yes, his goal total in his 56 goal season were inflated by Thornton's insane passing - But all great snipers play with good centers. I don't know if he would have scored 50 more than once, but he certainly was a good player and would have stuck around in the NHL for a while as a 20+ goal scorer if he hadn't had some many injuries."
It's a shame how much those knee and groin issues took away from his game.
"Haven't heard that name in a while, forgot he had a 56 goal season, crazy!"

One of those guys you'll never forget. Cheers Cheech! 
"From what I heard he found his second wind in the KHL, but was already pretty old by then.  It was hella-fun to watch him play.  He was never the strongest skater but had a hell of a release and both quick enough/smart enough to get open in small spaces.  "
I actually bought myself a HV71 Cheechoo jersey during the lockout season. Really liked him but I didn’t expect him to win the rocket richard the following year.

"He was nothing before Thornton, and he was nothing after Thornton."

People think Thornton made him but the fact is they had amazing chemistry. It's too bad he was hampered by injuries.
"Come now, he scored those 28 goals with Thornton.

**SCOTT** Thornton and ~~Mark~~ Mike Ricci.

I'm so glad this seems to be coming full circle. At times it felt like I was waging a one-man war on HF to defend him as nothing more than a product of Jumbo. Cheechoo was an amazing shooter, but just not a good skater (for the NHL), and the injuries sealed his fate. His determination and shot was enough to get him to a richard, but it only barely compensated for his skating, when he lost any bit of that, it was over in the bigs."
"I remember those hat tricks, they were traumatizing. "
"Joe Thornton was both the best thing and worst thing to happen to him. Cheechoo should have been a long time 2nd line forward in the NHL. Instead, he gets paired with Thornton and has a ridiculous year making people overvalue him. Then all the injuries pile up and no amount of play will satisfy anyone. It's sad.

He was one of the big reasons the Sharks made their first WCF in 2004."
"Sad story, glad he made the show and I hope he’s found some peace now. "

"i was pissed that year that jagr didnt win the richard. but knowing what it meant to your city....yeah, glad he didn't."
"As a Bellevillian, that game is legendary"
"Man, those little towns up in Northern Ontario are such shit holes filled with crime and drunks. Living conditions are brutal in some areas. I'm surprised Cheech made it out of there and ended up winning the Rocket Richard. Definitely one of those feel good stories.

You know you're from the sticks when the city is called Moose Factory"
You can't post this and then not link to [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EZ7dc0mv_A).
Thanks for the memories lmao. Great video.
Well shit. That's going to be in my head the rest of the day. 
KHL
[never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EZ7dc0mv_A)
"I mean, he had 27 without Thornton. Not exactly a scrub."
The surgeon who performed his sports hernia surgery was a hack
I mean before the trade Cheechoo had 24 GP 7 goals and 15 points. He was a fine player but it is what it is man. 
"Yep, he'll always be up there with Jason Spezza, Mike Murphy, PK Subban, Danny Cleary, and Bryan Cameron as some of the best Bulls in my eyes"
"You're thinking of Seto, no history I know of with Cheecho and substance abuse"
"Because 27 goals before Jumbo arrived is definitely ""nothing"""
"That's funny, you were nothing before, *during* **and** after he played with Thornton, so he's still got you beat by miles."
You're better than this. Put a little more effort into your next trolley ride.
Hatrick Marleau is best Marleau
"He wasn’t the fastest skater to begin with, but his shot placement and release were incredible. He worked hard to overcome his natural deficiency, but once the injuries compounded that he just couldn’t keep up anymore. I still miss the sound of train whistles at The Tank. "
"I've always been annoyed by the ""Joe Thornton made him"" crowd.

No doubt Joe made him better, but show me someone else who scored 50 playing with Joe. If it was all Joe, why couldn't anyone else do it?"
"> Mark Ricci.

?"
"Holy fuck, his shooting percentage the year he scored 40 was 30.8%."
Yeah that's pretty ridiculous. 
"You mean Habs Legend and Stanley Cup winner, Gary Leeman?"
Jagr was 2nd that year for both the Richard (2 behind Cheechoo) and the Art Ross (2 behind Thornton). I really thought he deserved the Hart that year. 
"Corey, Trevor, two smokes let's go. I'm a Northern Ontario boy and I love it, but oh yeah bud, some places got problems, especially up thataway. The expression is ""only hookers and hockey players come out of *that* town"". A ghetto sounds warmer when you're up there.

I know to the larger hockey world it's probably just ""Oh another boring Canadian got 50 goals again. Overrated"" to some of 'em, but here, it's good to have guys make it out of those towns, to show the kids that you can. Role models. Success story for the annual Little NHL hockey tournament."
"Was on mobile when I commented that.

also [I prefer this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLJWS_y3bHI)"
Yeah that's my point
Probably cost Chooch millions 
"28 goals 19 apples for 47 points in 81 GP in 2003-04, then lost a year to lockout. The Joe Thornton trade was on November 30th, 2005"
"yeah, go fuck yourself

Watch some of those goals, he had a finishing touch that was already brilliant - Jumbo certainly contributed to the big totals, but Cheecho could put em in the net."
Ah yes my mistake. Corrected it now.
What about [4-Goal Marleau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGSyON8HxFY)?  All in the same period no less.
CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Yeah, he playd with Heatley at the end of his prime. "
"Right you are.  Look at Devin Setoguchi, who was supposed to be Cheechoo 2 (electric boogaloo, but with skating abilities...)"
"Mike, god dammit"
The love child of Mike Ricci and Mark Recchi.
Mario was just banking pucks off him.
A wooden post could score 30 on a line with Mario. Just hunker down in the slot.
"no way, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqMzejO2BbQ) is hands down the best one."
"Yeah that's a solid year. But (and I'm sure you don't need to be told) there is a MASSIVE difference between a 20 goal scorer that touches 30 a couple times and even a 40 goal scorer never even mind a 50 goal scorer. 

He was on pace for 25ish goals again the year Thornton got traded there and after the trade it was *literally* a 70 goal pace. 


Cheechoo was a good player and maybe even the best finisher Thornton ever played with but 49 goals in 58 games after one of the greatest playmakers ever gets traded there speaks for itself. "
That's what he said. He didn't say he sucked
Uh huh
Lol ok tough guy
"Dude, chill. No one's saying he couldn't score. But he wouldn't have had the success he had without Thornton."
Strokin' it
"That reminds me of an interview with Gino Odjick where he was asked about his goals while playing with Bure. He said something like ""Pavel said to go to the far post, put your stick on the ice, and close your eyes"""
Til the Oilers need wood posts on the ice so McDavid can score more. 
"Get real. This is truly the greatest one 

https://youtu.be/tcsMkJKRFgc"
"Lmao never heard/seen this guy before, that was a wild ride "
"He scored 28 goals with Scott Thornton and ~~Mark~~ Mike Ricci as his primary line mates.

You're taking this too far the other direction."
"Fair enough, I'm just sick of the jokes. Dude played his ass off and was incredible, injury and botched surgery took him out of the league way too fast. The majority of folks don't get it, and the Jumbo won the Richard bouncing goals of Cheecho jokes infuriate me."
"He made the NHL from Moose Factory before Thornton. No one on any team would have had the success they had without their teammates. It's not easy to play on a line with top players who can think the game that fast, and put pucks on your tape before you even know if they saw you. If McDavid/Crosby were that good that just anyone could play with them, they wouldn't even have to pay for wingers. Guys like Kunitz, Maroon and Guentzel deserve all the credit they get.  

If finishing was that easy, everyone would be able to do it."
"That's how Odjick scored 16 goals one year. Boggles my mind when I see people call Odjick an enforcer with a lot of skill. He was an enforcer, period."
on the Cheechoo train.  
He was a good player who benefited at some point from playing with a great player. Nothing wrong with that. He has his RR and am pretty sure not everyone on Thornton's line produced like Cheecho. 
He was skilled at being an enforcer. 
"i don't remember anybody saying that, but yeah, if i did i'd be the first to correct them... he's an enforcer with a heart of gold, but not much in the way  of skill"
"Well I have seen LegoRocks99 on youtube make Odjick 83 overall in his 1993-94 Canucks sim, stating his 16 goals as the reason lol"
Well that's just implausible at best lol he's a 69 and he's happy to be a 69. 
"I mean the Sedins were rated like 82 or 83 by NHL18, how the hell was Odjick 83. "
*intangibles*
Difference between current and prime Sedins

Just another day in the thunderdome
As a franchise we're 18 now so we're trying all kinds of things we were never able to before and I gotta say it feels pretty good
Glad I got to see it live!!
Was the previous record when they dropped 4 on us in like 5 min earlier this season?
Still lookin to lose our Virginia tho
Pssst... ^we ^are ^17
Nope. It was [from our 2015 season opener when we netted 4 in 5:07](https://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/201510080COL.html). We went from being down 4-1 about five minutes into the third to winning 5-4. Parise got a hat trick. Here's the [full video of that comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR-NcLYqD3A). 
"Haha good call, it probably was! They’ve had a quite a few rounds of quick succession goals in the past. Always fun to see!"
"It's weird but almost all my favorite Wild clips where one or all of them do something awesome is against the Avs.

Haha Aves
Also the time we scored 4 goals on them for a franchise record time. Someone should find a clip of that. 
"""A Swede of Swedish descent.""

I like watching the ducks when they give a shit
This Gibson guy is alright at hockey I take it..
“Just Superman punch him bro” pretty sure that’s what bieksa told montour
Cool to hear that JS Giguere was at the game tonight too...
What a fucking waste of 2.5 hours at 10pm
The crowd audio is super low. You can barely hear the woos.

"It has been ~~0~~ 0 day's since Ritchie has taken a bad penalty.

Just curious.. what's with the random woo-ing?
What did you guys send to New Jersey for Henrique again?

I am gonna be super pumped if Ovi makes it to 600 tonight. But do we really need the cameras focused on him while he is skating off casually for a line change?

We win tonight and we jump the Sharks....in the standings.  
RAK CITY
God I fucking love how Getzlaf just makes that pass look so fucking casual.
I can't tell if I am drunk or are the caps drunk?
I’m not sure Holtby can function without Mitch Korn to be honest.
There are some white lights up in the air that keep strobing randomly here at Honda Center and its getting really annoying. Does this happen often here?
"Ugh I can't believe I'm saying this, but good job hawks for beating the avs."
I think Alan May could get this team to play better hockey.
Really feeling the love. Thanks everyone! <3
Hockey? I like hockey 
2 positives: Grubauer and our SOG
Don't think I've ever seen Gibson smile. he's always so stone~~d~~ faced.
We have got to be literally the worst empty net team in the league haha

No it would be his third shut out!! He got one against the pens too

I just don't fucking understand why our defensive zone play is so bad. Even our better players have problems. Why the fuck won't our coaching staff have practices where we focus on that? It's the weakest part of our game right now. Trotz might actually just be a fucking passenger with this year's team. This is fucking stupid.

Good first period Ducks!
Roy-Rico-Kase could be kind of cool. Have we tried that?
"A little late to the game, how are we looking?  Saw we got an early goal. "
Yay late night dinner
I was promised Alan May who are these people :(
"Aww, Mr. And Mrs. Kerrigan. Sorry you have to play for the skins."
Damn I thought Kemp just bombed his first goal in there...
GREAT POKE CHECK!
"Well, good night"
Damn that was beautiful 
"Rik Rak, paddy wack, give a Swede a goal."
"RICK RACK IS ON THE ATTACK!!!

HIT IT!!

http://wejustscored.com/teams/ana.html"
JFC I thought holtby caught that 
"QUACK QUACK QUACK

RAK CITY"
Pull holtby pls. 
Finally. Stop fucking starting Holtby
DAMN it kelly
"Man Ovi, Backstrom, and Wilson look like the only ones really trying"
Trotz's stupid strategy for our defensive play is to throw it off the boards. Every team in the league knows this and they literally just stack the boards and keep the puck it. I wish we would just fire him now and let Todd take over for the post season and we can reevaluate in the off season.
"Fuck, Wilson. Please be okay :("
That's gonna leave a mark
Just got out! Snagging food and on my way home for the 3rd! Keep the ketchup flowing!!
Another shutout for the Ducks....good for you guys
WHYYYYYYY
Great play josh 
How in the world is this team leading the Metro?
Man It'd be nice if we could catch a break here...
Somebody's gonna get punched
"Oshie has been doing good shit tonight, been underplayed"
GIBBY
"This is one of those games where our D + Gibby combo just looks very comfortable. Nothing has felt especially threatening, and when it does Gibby is just on point. "
It snowed holy shit
Wonder when we'll see Brown and Vermette again
Gibby looks so calm in there.
"I played as a ""parent"" in one of my nephew's parents vs kids game yesterday and because of the age group (12-14, pond hockey league) it felt like I was playing against The Mighty Ducks (of District 5.)"
Caps friends why is holtby Soo bad? Or is it the defense too?
[Gibson's mask save on Orpik](http://md-akc.med.nhl.com/mp4/nhl/2018/03/07/22a8020d-d8a3-43ea-8414-523d2e33ebbb/1520399547703/asset_1800k.mp4)
Does Wilson normally just check the boards
SKATER PILE
We really hate that open net goal
Damn we were finally so close

I love the Ducks but I die a little everytime I watch a game and see how empty the stands are. God damn our fanbase.
Wowwwww
oh holtby. what happened to you
"""capitals intermission next"" wait what."
Low IQ Ritchie strikes again. 
Good kill
Wtf no Alan may why do we get the NBCSN intermission ):
Caps fans you've got a solid broadcasting tandem. I love hazy and ahlers but its nice listening to your crew so far.
And there goes Holtby...
Moving on to beer
Lovin the work that Grant is giving.
I find these commentators extremely charming
Been listening to the Caps cast tonight. Just wanted to say these guys are top tier commentators

Random game for us on nbcsn?
Let's fucking go!!!
Ask Alexa who her favorite hockey team is.  smh.
"Upboats the GDT, hockey fans!"
Okay Ducks. Let's strike early!
ORPIK DID A THING!
RICO!
"Uh I was on the wrong channel, why are were we on the PK?"
TONTON RICO
yesss
Strap yourselves in boys 
Hell yeah Rico! Great way to start things off.
That looked agin kinda weak haha
Jesus boys
"Great stuff Blaine, glad you're doing your job /s"
GIBBY!
"Carlson is so fucking bad with giveaways, that's why he'll never be top 5 for Noris no matter how many points he gets in a season

Edit: 2 obvious giveaways in a single powerplay"
"Nisky looks awful to start this game :/. I've seen 2 or 3 turnovers already, including one that lead to the Ducks goal."
Kesler and Wilson fight would be sweet
"Yeah, I'll be going to bed at the end of the first."
Fuck...
this is gonna be another one of those games isn’t it
"Haven't been to a Caps practice in a few years, if I go to a practice and talk mad shit to Trotz will I be escorted out?"
"Fuck you, you fat baby "
Are they booing ovi?
PING!
Man Oshie can't catch a break LOL
"Intermission question, will the Golden Knights go deep into the playoffs? "
"Just getting home, let me guess..."
Ovi 600 tonight? Can I call that? 
John Carlson either scores a big goal or coasts the entire game. Not a lot in between.
Nice
Can't clear the zone again
Trotz has lost faith in Holtby....
GRUBY HELL YEAH
Jeez Kerrigan is huge
"Shit I saw Wilson crash into Gibson and was worried about Gibby, but then I saw Tom..."
rip Wilson :(
"Kris ""Tanto"" Pronto sounds like a massive fucking douche"
Defense not interested by Burakowsky it seems.
HOCKEY GODS WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO DESERVE THIS
"Nicknames are so weird. Bieksa = Juice, but if Djoos was on our team I'd want to call him Juicy fruit or JuJu something entirely different than Juice. "
Bieksa just destroyed his tail bone.
Is it me or have refs been exceedingly bad at calling Offsides/Icing this season?

STOP WITH THIS DIPSY DOODLE BULLSHIT. PLAY MORE SIMPLE. STOP TRYING TO DANGLE EVERYONE.

Shame!
"Hey here's a thought: if our announcers piss you off so bad mute the tv and play your radio guys' commentary. 

That's how I got through most of the playoff games against the Pens last year."
Just got back home from the Jackets game. Saw we scored twice. Good times.
"That's two games in a row we chased a goalie. All of a sudden were bringing the pain. Good to see Raks getting warm, he had my worried for a large part of the season."
"Holtby's gonna be chased before this game is over. Quack, quack, waterfowl brethren. "
"PP GOAL!!!!

HIT IT!!

http://wejustscored.com/teams/ana.html"
For real though who is this announcer?
I thought Barry Trotz supposedly lost weight but he is still built like a snow man.
Fat baby causing problems already?
Holtby what happened to you man :(
Yep that's a slash all day.
What a stupid penalty by 37
"Intermission writing update. As requested by /u/JustAGuyNamedAJ:

Tonight has been a little slower going simply because there are some sections I've run into with wholesale re-writes or paragraph long additions. Otherwise It's going pretty smoothly. I've edited 8 pages tonight (about 3 during that first period) and will probably stop sometime during the 2nd period as there is only so much editing you can do in a night before you start to worry that what you wrote is absolute shit and not worth saving."
"WOOO just got home, ducks on the tele, chili in me belly"
Fucking Orpik...passing back while wide open 6 feet from the net. Unreal.
"Chased him out!!!

Keep it up boys!"

"Great, Wilson's hurt. Might as well pack it up tonight guys. Only 3-4 other players on the team that actually care."
Fuck off beagle
Caps should take their anger out on Trotz
“Playing 5 On 5” ... Looked more like a Ducks PP to me there for a bit...
"no good replay, but these announcers think that Kesler hit that..... this feed is [trash emoji]"
Yess good kill 
Ana fuckin Heim.
2 games in a row we chase the goalie. Keep the pressure up.
National broadcast but gives us Washington's local broadcasters? Seems fair /s not even trying to be neutral.
These announcers aren't even trying to be neutral. 
"So this is what it is like to watch people shit all over announcers for some other team.

You guys should do what the Pens did and create a karma whoring drinking game out of it.


Caps announcers suck... drink!"
lol Ritchie
Go Pondguins.
Can we please stop pretending Holtby is a good goalie this season?
Isn't a Caps game in 2018 if Holtby doesn't let in an early softie.
GO CAPS GO
Awwww bye holtby
Why does this NBCsports announcing sound like a Washington local channel?
Why does everyone slide into Gibby 
"I'm watching the  game on NBC and I'm listening to the Washington announcers for the first time. Man it is so annoying here this guy call ovechkin ""the great eight"" instead of just his name. "
Wilson plays like a duck lol
WE CHASED HOLTBEAST!
Caps feeling the full dad dick
Cmon Pond Ducks!  
Had to buy two suits for my new job today. Anyone here have to wear a suit every day to work?
It seems.quiet there for a team that's leading only 4 minutes in.
Way to go Bieksa
"Hmm, Refs giving the compensation call, surprising. "
Miss you Chimmer <3
*yawn*
I still don't understand how we didn't make ANY moves on trade deadline like clearly our shit isn't working and how we are 1 in the metro is beyond me
Wubble Wubble motherfuckers
Hejdå Holtby !
"Always get downvoted for this, but again, Holtby is trash this year and Gruby needs to be getting these starts. "
Lmao laughlin
"Just bench holts for the season.  Let gruby play.  Holtby has been hot trash, especially early in the game, he can never get set.  He is mentally off and a detriment to this team."
good god ducks are dominating
"Caps peeps, any idea if Ilya Samsonov is close to making the jump to the NHL? 

As good as Holtby *has* been (maybe not so much this season), having a  1A/1B duo of Grubauer and Samsonov can't be *that* bad.

And if the Caps can trade Holtby for something good, that'd be a bonus."
Fucking boom.
"Just so you know, Gibson does not believe in shutouts. "
I feel oddly optimistic about this one
Won't be able to catch the game but let's go Caps! Hope Ovi gets the 600th today!
"Ok DET/BOS, let's wrap this game up. I predict BOS winning this one pretty quickly if they go to OT.
  
Edit: Yuuuuup"
woo we on tv!
It's snowing hard right now.
What's everybody eating?  I'm eating baby carrots with cinnamon raisin peanut butter.  It's delish!
"I keep thinking I should make a thread about it, but never do, so instead I'll ask, when are people thinking Ovi gets 600?  Tonight?  Next game?  In three or more?  After game 1000?"
We need these 2 points to start making some space.
ehhhhhh
Caps back on HD now for those with shitty RCN.
"Well if they're calling it this soft, Orpik will have like 5 penalties"
Anyone in western Canada or even Alberta getting this game on any channels?
So did they change the 'neutral zone' to the 'turnover to the speeding ducks player zone'?
"Ahhh so far we're back to this brand of hockey. Slow, indecisive, icing when we're on the powerplay, early penalties, bad defensive coverage, and not creating any scoring opportunities."
This is gonna be a long game boys..
[deleted]
Must of had a great free skate practice earlier today /s #fucktrotz
Jeez Burky control the puck
Great scramble!
Did we really trade draft picks just for another guy to be a scratch every game??
yeaaaahhhh
That positioning is just fucking stellar.  The Squirt hockey puck watching is alive and well in the NHL. Thatta way boys!  Caps trying to prove hockey is for everyone because there are some 18 Tier 1s out there who are more aware in their own zone.
This Jackie Stewart commercial is so creepy. The cgi is so bad 
Any Canadians getting this game on any channel that I might have missed?
lol smooth move ferguson
TY post
Any reason they're booing Carlson?
Much better powerplay there
Oshie needs to sacrifice a goat...
"Well much better chances that PP, we look a bit more alive"
"Much better (though not perfect) PP from us, but also a great PK by the Ducks (with a little help from the post)."
"Caps Bros, what happened to Horn Guy? Haven’t heard much horn this season."
So is the whole metro shit if we're 1 or?
hows gibby been tonight?
Who the fuck are they booing?
"just one of those nights, watching ovi barely miss that one... 

fuck this sport sometimes :("
So what's up with Holtby? Is he having a slump because I remember he was pretty good the past few seasons.
"Shocker, Sion top again..."
"If someone never finds ""LETS GO DUCKS LADY"" and marries her, then I will"
AiC!
Anyone else in the DMV getting a pretty choppy signal?
"Burra has looked good this game, just slightly missed 3 or 4 times."
Still kinda makes me nervous when the Ducks play to not lose. 
"Lol, ok Wilson"
"Not sure why everyone's complaining about the announcers, I prefer them over ours...

Ours are one of the worst"
Can the Caps sub out Holtby now?
Lol Wilson nice job bro.
"""holtby has no chance.""

except if he were actually in position..."
Step up monty
Holtby will literally never get a shutout this season. Stupid mistakes from the rest of the team and then just letting in softies on a nightly basis pretty much confirm it.
lol ~~Kesler~~ Ritchie picking on the third smallest d-man in the league.
What a weak goal. 
can gruby start for the rest of the season?
"Ok my last comment made it sound like I wanted willy to be injured. 

Wasnt my intent my bad, "
Honestly kind of looked like Monty turned sideways to not run directly into him
"Lol i like how the ducks made the caps resort to this

"
"Alright put in Grubauer, I've seen enough"
Ice seems great
Damn it Bieksa
Bieksa sux 
Come on bieksa...
WHAT ARE THESE PASSES PLS
Yoshi can't buy a goal at the moment
"First two goals scored while I was driving home, third when in the shower... Think I'll go make myself an evening snack... Mango and tajin here I come."
Ovi with the slash 
"PP time, Pondguins. Let's go!"
Duckies seem to love sloppiness.  Let me see that 2 screener shit again!
Is everyone in agreement here that the commentators are pure garbage?
[deleted]
This broadcast team just never show's replays.
"Guys, you'll have your own announcers back soon enough. Woooosaaa"
Please dont battery ram into Gibson
Whoooo!  Nice placement!  Thank you Mr. Wilson!
Did gibson just cheat? Clearly knocked wilson into the net
"Death, Taxes, and the Ducks blowing it in the third"
Shutout?
"Damn. We're really outplaying the ducks now. PS, you guys think the ducks will trade Gibson for holtby 1/1? LOL but pls do"
"Hi Caps. I know I'm mean to you and your players a bunch for a fan of a Central team, but I want you to know that I'm sorry. Please to be beating the ducks. I'd even be okay with it if Wilson punched Kesler or Perry in the face.

Love,

AvsFan

P.S: All punching must be in proper fisticuffs. No intent to injure please."
I want to celebrate but its a goal vs Holtby this season so im not that impressed
[deleted]
[removed]
That puck crossed the goal line
[removed]
Wilson needs to be ejected before he ends someone's season
"I'm tired of Wilson, Holtby, and DSP. But most of all I'm tired of Trotz."
Ovi is so cold rn
[removed]
Hahahaha fuck you wilson!!! You piece of shit player
[removed]
I hope gibson is fucking hurt
"""...from Sweden."""
I started laughing. Great insight locker
But what country is he from?
“From Sweden...a Swede with Swedish descent...”
Where you work/live?
Fuck Scott Stevens.
Amen
"It’s so refreshing, isn’t it?"
"If there's one thing opposing teams' fanbases take away when they play us, it's how good Gibby is. Doesn't get enough love since he's on the Ducks."
"They said he was on vacation, he definitely looked like he was on vacation also. 

Fly AF: https://twitter.com/AnaheimDucks/status/971240398621429761"
It's a travesty that he has had to wait so long to be retired. Should be the next guy in the rafters.
Same man. 
Thankfully 
He gave him a 'wooo'
"""Wooooooooo fuck yeah""

-Getz"
NBCSN would never adjust the mic level of the crowd....never!
They’re always low on NBC (at least at Honda)
I would say they tried but Idk if that’s true 
And isn't he with San Diego right now? lol

Well played.

I support that!

I would lpve you forever if you take out the Kings.
I hope so!  I'll wear my lucky BEAT LA shirt that day.
Please do.
The Golden Gauntlet starts here.
Please do!
"I smiled, bravo"
I don't know. better wait an hour just to be sure.
Can we not? Neither of us need injuries this late in the season.
I don't want anyone to see this effort from the Caps
Captain I'm upvoting it with everything she's got but I don't think she can take anymore!
Where's golf going?
I'm down. I would actually schedule my vacation time around that if we could pick a date in June-Julyish
Do we have to wear name tags with our username?

It's very misguided. Originally it was Rick flair woo after a goal was scored. Now it's just a free for all woo fest that I don't subscribe to lol

"UPDATE: The Anaheim Ducks organization and fans (aforementioned as ""sir"") have reviewed your request for four goals. While our policy in the past has been to allow forward Alex Ovechkin to score goals at will, we feel that it is not in the best interests of the franchise given our current playoff position and desire to salvage an adversity-filled season. Therefore we have chosen to deny your request.

Warm Regards,

The Quack Pack"
Denied.

You're not wrong.
"I know you probably get this a lot, but for an ignorant west coaster: what happened to Holtby? Wasn't he like top 5, it not higher, last year?"
Yeah I mean he pushed Wilson right on Gibson! /s
I mean probably 
Would you rather talk about the caps? 
it's weird too because almost every other GDT enjoys JoeB
"Are your announcers doing the NBC Sports stream?  I like em, plus like I said below, the color commentator sounds like Dan Akroyd, good stuff."
"this is /r/hockey, folks will find any reason to complain"
With how bad they've been probably. Mixing players up constantly.
That goal by Hampus was these announcers suck! /s
I live in the DC area and they’re good when you’re a caps fan but as a ducks fan sheesh the bias
"tbf, the caps have looked like complete ass for the entirety of the game so far."
:(
Need me some Hazy
They only get excited for the Caps. This broadcast is probably torture for them to try and fake excitement for our goal.
Joe B is a fucking treasure mah dude. Locker sucks.
Surprised you didn’t get downvoted for this. Usually anything anti-JoeB is a quick negative.  Annoys the shit out of me.

These caps announcers are the worst I've heard in while. They're just boring
Shades of the early 2000's.  Kinda like a DPI where the cornerback didn't ever look for the ball.

2018 Holtby is trash
"Not taking anything away from the way you guys have been playing, but Holtby let in a couple softies.  Caps have had good but not great chances that you stepped up on."
The setups have been really nice. I don't think the caps are playing as strong defensively 
Quality over Quantity
He frequently gets put on the top line with Ovie and no one knows why
I'll always love him for the tying goal in Dallas.
We don't want him either.
I miss the Ice Cheetah.

Why the fuk is an Anaheim home game only done by caps announcers?
What do they have to be enthusiastic about so far?

#justcapsthings
Holtby has been playing like the backup for a while now. I think I heard the announcers say he’s been pulled in 3 of his last 6 starts. 
"Legume, no?"
ITS IN THE NAME THOUGH. FAKE NEWS. RUSSIAN SOMETHING. FLAT EARTH.
Does me nutting on your mom count as a nut?
Me. Barely. Not the Caps apparently.

"No idea, but somehow I feel like it is related to the recent issues with Fox Sports and western cable companies. They have both been pointing fingers at each other on social media for the broadcasts shitting out lately. Apparently there have been contract disputes or some shit."
"He did it last game too, not as bad of a slash then. It's sad to say that he needs to learn how to not slash a goalies glove. If you poke at the glove you'll get a few shoves from the d, but odds are you aren't going to the box. Chop down on the glove? Enjoy your 2 minute penalty. "
I feel like he's off every other night at this point. People get upset when Trotz benches him but what do you expect when he has games like this.
woah this is sick

"My guess (in order of likelihood) for ducks players:

Dude's snakebit right now.
They've done a really good job of directing rebounds/loose pucks to where there aren't any Caps.
In Anaheim?
Where? Like...in general? I would hope so. 
I said it below but I feel like somethings up with Vermy...either an injury or he's in the doghouse with management for something. Or I have no place as an armchair coach and think Vermy is better than he is. 
I would prefer either over Kelly 
Nothing like a solid hip check on a 12 yr old... Gotta show ‘em who’s alpha. 
"He's in his head something fierce but our defense is epic bad right now, too."

If I do won't that mean more gross Pens fans will flock in here with their flightless shit?
Ask and ye shall receive!
Wilson called for interference. 
2 minutes for being tom wilson
He'd probably just scratch Vrana or something
You'll probably get shanked 
I sure as fuck hope not.
"Hard to say

Honestly i dont think theyre built for playoff hockey"
Caps fans expect the ol McPhee 2-and-out.
I think they'll get to the second round 
"Most people thought they'd be bad coming into the season. Now most people think they're going to be good coming into the playoffs.

So I'm going with the opposite of everyone else's opinion."
"Hard to tell.  Fancy stat wise they seem to be playing about the same as they have all season, so no reason to think they can't continue.  But we all know the playoffs are a completely different animal."
"I don't think they will, but also I didn't think they'd be this close to first place. My opinion? Tough first round loss. Perhaps 7 games."
I say they lose in 6 games in round 2
They started strong but they've been having some really bad stretches lately and seem to be catching the old injury bug at a bad time. I just don't know if they can get further than the second round.
600 what?
He mike green 2.0?
I mean only one goal tonight wasn't his fault.
Grubi isn't going to fix our defensive failures or inability to clear the zone.

The Caps announcers 
I don't like it 
"I agree, he should go train somewhere for the rest of the season and we'll get another coach."
I mean Holtby had no chance on that one.
That wasn't on Holtby.
Everything he does is stupid 
Have you read bird by bird by Anne lamotte? That last line of yours resonates with so much of the theme of that book.
Is this the 2nd book?

I thought it was a good decision actually
B E A Utifal...

😘
🤪🍆
"Ehh, not too difficult to chase Holtby nowadays haha"
"Not to rain on your parade but Holtby's been pulled from 3 of his last 6 now, allowing 22 goals."
Not hard to chase holtby  (or score on him) this year.  At all.  He is playing Hiller level.  
I don't know how this is so hard to understand. The broadcast is just being relayed from the local station to nbcsn. There is no requirement for them to be enthusiastic for both teams.
What did you think they did wrong this time?
They're doing a better job at it than Hayward does.
"Wait until he says, 5on5 and even strength.  No shit, dumbass.  You just said it’s 5on5, the even strength qualifier is completely unnecessary."
"He referred to Anaheim’s 67 as “Rakell Rickard” twice, and spent most of a stoppage in play shitting on Kesler when it was Nick Ritchie starting shit and Kesler was on the bench. "
Noot noot!
Hi there birdbro
That’s a softie? Jesus I wouldn’t want you to be my coach 
Its a fucking rip high glove from the slot if thats a softie then what the hell isnt?
Thanks Caps West
It's just Let's Go Caps for us. But I love the enthusiasm.
You're entitled to your opinion 
Because it is. 
It is.
Because it is.
Because it is the Washington local channel.
"To be fair, our d kind of pushes most people into him."
Locker is a treasure
We all know who the real great 8 is... ;)
"In all fairness we call our players by their nicknames all the time

:edit: I read the comment wrong. But, ill keep my original comment so people can point and laugh at me."
That's just Locker. Locker is a moron.
"Dont like hearing facts?  Maybe ""the greatest eight"" would be better for ya.  Or Alexander the Gr8?"
Not really a beast this season but I'm sure it feels good.
More like HOLTBUST
Shut up Meg.
I need a new suit because I ruined my last one at a wedding by cutting my knee open on a table because bourbon.
My office is one door down the hall from my bedroom... so nope.
Yup everyday. Do yourself a huge favor and spend the money to get both suits tailored. A well-fitting suit is a huge asset in any profession.
Look at all those empty seats. Jeez
Announcers putting you to sleep too?
"I mean we made two moves right before the deadline and couldn't find/afford any blockbusters right on it.  That's just how it works, our splash out trade was last year."
"We knew we weren't gonna be a cup contender this year. What do you expect them to do, trade for Karlsson and a top 6 forward?"
I've definitely thought about this considering Holtby has been garbage this season.
"Other than the trade deadline already being passed, no way they would have gotten actual value for him off this season."
Hey! Whoa!  What are we doing here!?
If you give Ovie 600 tonight you can take the win
We typically dont do well on national games
Could you give us some of that weather. I don’t like 75 degree weather in the winter.

"If they stay consistent, I am pretty sure the Ducks will have 8 penalties by the 2nd period."
I'm fine with that.
That’s the Orpik zone.  It hasn’t changed all season.
"its not lookin' good so far, I'm gonna be honest"
Look out of sync. Turnovers. Interference....one for each team.
Which team are you talking about
Pm.me for a stream

"Anaheim hates America, obviously."
ovi.
No pls don't hurt ovi
"He's at home games and still tooting, I mean not on the road tho."
On point
Lookin great! Very happy
They are “woo”-ing
"Yeah, just slumping.  Defense is weaker + his saving has been weaker."
"Definitely a down year for him. I think that’s pretty normal over the length of a career, but he needs to figure it out and fix it."
Yeah he's been pretty awful lately
"The playoffs last year damaged his confidence pretty bad and he was only okay to start this season, and then the allstar game happened and it completely destroyed what was left of his confidence to leave him playing terribly."
"Couldn't tell u.  Maybe he is just trash without Mitch Korn.  Maybe he lost his mojo.  Maybe its all in his head/he isnt mentally tough.  Who fucking knows, but with this coaching staff nothing is going to change.  We gonna keep seeing his shite play for the rest of the year and watch orpik get ice over players that deserve it more.  We wont even make the second round.  Ovi will go for 50 and then they will all pack it in for golf.  No fucks given, it seems."
"Defense has been worse and he wasn't stealing games like the last few years.  He started letting in goals, got into his own head, so now he's letting in what should be easy ones.  
"
Defense sucks. Holtby sucks (this season).  Both sucking makes him suck more.
@DuxScreamerGirl on Twitter. She’s pretty chill...
"depends, is she attractive

who am i kidding i make everyone around me attractive"
What
Yeah horrible Wifi at the DMV.
Verizon here and it’s a bit choppy at times.
But they aren't playing not to lose? They haven't sat back at all. That last shift by our top line was amazing. 
"BOOOOO

BOOOO

BOOOO"
WHAT HOW
We've pretty much been asking that all season
he had no chance
Pretty tired of the apologist routine from Laughlin.
If montour can punch as fast as he can skate it would be a decent fight 
Monty would cease to exist if he fought Wilson
Not like he's helping his case at all
It's gotten so pathetic that I've just been tracking his 1 goal games. He hasn't allowed only 1 goal since Nov 18.
"Except it was Ritchie, the announcer just knows nothing about the Ducks he’s been messing players up all night "
"called a ""holtby"""
His elbow came up at the end and he jumped up in the air. 
It comments like that this that make me chuckle when people ask why we hate you guys 
Caps can't anticipate our next move if we dont know what were doing
Tis our bread and butter. Whatever works!
"Hard disagree here. I think these dudes are charming, and have to be some of the least biased commentators I've heard. Calling Ducks passing ""exquisite"", calling it like it is. I like em. A lot. 

Edit: And they used the phrase ""panic quotient"". I fucking love it. "
nah
Nah. I've always liked Washington's guys. Especially their cadence.
I like them actually.
What?
Is mute not an option on the west coast? I use it all the time here in the midwest 🙄
Your own man pushed Willy down into him...
wat
dude...
You dont have room to chirp about blowing leads
You’re annoying 
Get your bad voodoo outta here!
NO 
Can we not advocate for player injuries?
Kesler 
*Kesler
Why would you want for Wilson to punch a stranger?
"Rly?

Is that what we're doing in this GDT now"
"Shush, you"
Dont be dumb
We should escort your ass immediately out of this GDT... 
You're acting like an Alberta fan. Don't be an Alberta fan.
Dude you’ve been stirring shit up all night. Chill and watch the game. 
Please leave and don't come back
No they haven’t and I say this as a Ducks fan.
"Pretty sure our defenseman took him down but I’ll have to see the replay again to know for sure 

Edit: It was Manson "
I mean he was shoved from behind by your player lol
Kick rocks pal
Why Wilson?
">4 goals in last 4 games

>so cold rn"
He's actually the only consistent cap alongside Kuzy
I'm hoping you get banned personally
"Cheering an injury, very classy."
"Said the ""should have been an abortion"" guy"

Yep
"It's the Capital way. Holtby plays like shit and gets pulled for Grubauer. The Caps get outmuscled the whole game and get frustrated. Wilson fights late in the second or early in e third to spark the team. Score a late goal in the third, still lose by 2 or 3 goals."

You’re underestimating Randy Carlyle’s turtle game tactics of “let them rack up 40 shots in the last half of the game.”
"Caps' movie is go down 0-2, go up 3-2, lose 3-4."
That makes me sad. I saw him get a shutout in D.C. last season and he was phenomenal. 
"The first two looked screened, or at least the second one was. Holtby should have that last one every time though."
I'll always love him for that goal against the Jets in the playoffs.
We could use his speed.

Exactly.
It's a national broadcast...they should be neutral tonight.
I mean at least try to sound enthusiastic if you also have to cater to the other base
The team that's first in Metro? Okay.

"They just mentioned a football player, who is in attendance, got married there and is now on his honeymoon."
Ryan Kerrigan (redskins LB) had his honeymoon there
Redskins QB is at the game and got married there I believe.
But that's the locker room lol. Don't understand why he's actually on the ice. Give Jerabek a chance.
Yeah chimera has been fine but I’m done with the kelly experiment. Unless vermette is nursing an injury or something it seems like h does everything kelly does but better in some cases and of course his FOs
what bothers me even more is that none of the goals holtby let in were fantastic-impossible-to-save goals. it could easily be 0-0 still. but holtby died last year in the pens and his reanimated corpse just isn't cutting it.
Oooh historical burn!

Aww. Poor killer hiller. Once a killer then became a hiller. 
They know it’s a national game though and should try to be more neutral.

apparently the goal tender is not responsible for tending to the goal.
That's Locker who played for the Caps back in the day. He messes up every night; even our own team.

"I have been fairly absent myself...work, family, etc."
"Long over due. I was hoping we would pull a Pens and get a new coach halfway through the season. 

I think a majority of Caps fans want to see a change. Trotz is a coaching dinosaur."
"Oh boy, don't get us started"
Caps fans don't even like themselves.
He's a lame duck - contact expiring at the end of the season.  Fans have not been pleased with Trotz for at least two seasons now.
"I've seen a lot of displeasure lately. For me it has to do with Holtby's play as of late. Trotz doesn't seem to want to play Holtby less, and while I still think Holtby is good and will spring back, something has been obviously wrong and he needs the rest to get his mind and/or body back in shape. Also not benching Orpik because our defense is poor and Orpik seems to be the one constant there besides Carlsson."
"He has been 




 Inconsistent "
He’s good at times he’s just dumb
Lets keep it that way
"That's your opinion, but they're employed by the local station. They're advertising caps tickets during the game. It's still the caps feed."
Aye. My point still stands. They're calling it from a Caps perspective but they're saying what the Ducks are doing well and what the Caps are doing poorly.
Glad I fell asleep so I could wake up and laugh to you guys defending Holtby and see those crap shots he let in after this one.
Ding ding ding!
Read the Edit lol
No most of us love Joe B and Locker
Apparently not. I love Joe B. but Locker is really stupid and his analysis is pretty bad considering he's a former player.
"Name a better 8.

(And no, selane isnt better.  The Great 8, Ovechkin for your ignorance, has played 464 fewer games and has 86 fewer goals and 264 fewer assists for a total of 350 fewer points in 12 fewer seasons and no 90's inflation.  Additionally, selane had 1.04 points per game and The Great 8 is 1.122, selane is barely in the top 50 all time at 49th.  After 13 seasons, mostly in the 90's, selane only had 981 pts and OVI already has 1107 and the season isnt over.  Would love to see OVI's goal totals if he also played in the point heavy 90's.  Dont talk about injuries (or hits either, ovi eclipses selane), part of what makes OVI The Great 8 is his durability.  So yeah, Ovechkin IS the Great 8, the greatest hockey player to ever wear the number.)"

The camera adds 10 pounds... of weights to the skates.
youd be v surprised
"Ah, well then yeah, it's for depth. Or GMBM wanted him to replace Orpik but Trotz won't. Not sure."
"LOL

i guess you could its doing its job"
Hazy usually gives an in depth analysis from the perspective of an NHL goalie and Ahlers is a national treasure

Lol ok.
Welp. I've got nothin to say then...
Average with glaring problems. You used to be able to say they could win any game because Holtby. Hasn't been the case all season. I haven't been this unenthusiastic entering the playoffs in ages.

I feel ya.  Orpik was the reason we beat you last year.  You guys had us without him.
Lmao what the fuck just happened. Clearly you had this argument prepared for anybody that tried to say anything to you. I never spoke about who is the better number eight. It is just an ignorant and ridiculous nickname to give somebody and call them throughout the game.

Yes this is true. Sidenote: I was at the game tonight. Damn good time. Korpi was beautiful!

Kind of are but my brain falling out of my skull sometimes is also my thing.
"That's the problem though. His coaching flaws are exposed in the postseason. Also, I personally think the Caps have been successful in spite of Trotz, not because of him. I would have to thank our GM for getting a team together that had two great chances to go all the way."

Either way, GLHF with the game tonight. 

How's this for a work of speculative non-fiction: Ducks win 3-2!"
🍷
You might wanna get that checked out. Or not. Thinking is overrated anyway. 
They don't suck. This is the first game where they haven't praised both teams while broadcasting nationally. They might not know it's nationalized. 
Man the Jackets shut that line down all night. 
Could the above request happen for the right amount of money?
"I just gotta switch up from scotch tape to something sturdier for keeping my skull closed, gotta ask uncle Red Green what he suggests."
Oh I've always thought they've sucked. It's not just tonight.
"The Jackets never really struggle to shut down superstar lines. They game plan well for 1/2 lines, then completely shit the bed when facing anyone else."
"You want me to write you a fan fic? 

I guess it would depend on how long of one you wanted and how specific you needed it to be. "
Pretty sure he'd tell you to keep your stick on the ice. Although I'm sure duct tape is gonna be the standard RG answer. Cheers. 
You're in a world by yourself then. Most people love them.
This is true. I would like to see the Jackets pick up another defense player. Its time to for Johnson to go sadly. 
"Well I was mostly joking but I actually have idea to where I could use some duck fan fic. 

Are you willing to go tasteful exotic?"
"Well keeping my head up would probably help hold it in place too, good point!"
And?
"With Nuti and Kuks back and healthy, the Jackets blue line is pretty solid as a unit. JJ should be the odd man out, but will that happen? Doubtful, because he has such valuable playoff locker room experience. Means nothing to me."
"Well I have no real experience writing it so I'm not sure how good it'd be, but I could try."
And what? I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I read your reply and it made me realize I don't feel the need to continue this conversation. So I said a statement and that's it.
I want a second round Jackets playoff push. That alone would make me extremely happy. 
"If we can usurp the Devils for WC1 and meet the Caps/Flyers in round one I could see it happen. I'd like to stay out of the Atlantic bracket. Honestly, a different opponent than the Pens would be great so I can see once and for all if playoff Bobs is terrible, or just against Shittsburg."
"I think Bobs playoff problem is when the playoffs come around it brings new fans. Fans who don't really understand Hockey. And, if he plays a game less then his Bob quality more people chime in about it being the goalies fault. And he takes it to heart and just shuts down. Bob is a national treasure and a adorable human.  "
"He and Korpi are such a great tandem just with the personalities they bring to the table. Bobs being the humble goalie savant with no shortage of love for the team, and Korpi more the lone wolf still trying to prove himself (even though in my opinion, he did plenty when he was our star in 15-16)."
"Korpi is very underrated. I feel bad for him at times because everyone tries to compare him to Bob. When you have commentators saying things like ""Be grateful it was Bob in net or it would have been a lot worse"". It's like we dont know that. Korpi has his strengths.   "
"Well in fairness, we like to harp on other teams for having bandwagon fans, but we gained a ton after December last year. And those very same people weren't around in 15-16 when it was Korpi night in and night out playing his heart out to steal us wins when he could. His heart and resolve definitely won me over quickly. Same reason why I still have a lot of respect for CMac even when our fanbase quickly abandoned him when he was a consistent force in net when he got to play."
I keep having flashbacks to the 2012 season
You mean you don't like having Bobs win a Vezina then us missing out on the playoffs to Minny by a tiebreaker?
=0(
"Or the season before that, where we (similarly to 2015) started 0-7-1 and had the rock star tandem of fucking Allen ""1 NHL Season"" York and Steve ""I was only good as a rookie"" Mason."
"I took a chance on The Athletic when it was half off for the year. The writing is quite good, and it's worth paying for if you're interested in multiple sports for sure. I'm glad I invested, and I will most likely renew at full price once the time comes. "
"Some cities are better than others. Imo CBJ, TOR, MIN, EDM, PHI and DET have great coverage. OTT, MON, PIT, VAN, WPG and CGY are good. DAL, STL NYR, NYI are ok. They just hired a devils reporter and the sharks coverage is a little weak (especially compared to their other SF coverage)"
"They are expanding all the time so just make sure your team has a dedicated writer. The Islanders writer just started a couple of weeks ago, he's been with the team for years and he seems to have a lot more freedom now."
"As a general hockey fan who follows the league as a whole, I think it's terrific. There have a great stable of writers. Coverage of your specific team may vary."
"The national coverage is superb, and I've started following other teams like Detroit because some of the writers are so good. NYR coverage is ok, but I joined before they even had New York so it's just a plus imo. "
"Its fantastic and well worth the small amount of money it costs. The writing is probably the best in hockey, especially for their national coverage. LeBrun always has really good pieces up each week "
"I have general interest in hockey so I enjoy reading about a variety of teams so I find it quite good and I like that they're longer more indepth pieces. My pro tip is to surf their site a few times (with cookies enabled), click sign up but then don't do it and then usually see ads online for 20 to 40 per cent off and up to 50 per cent off via Facebook. Buy it when you get a 50 per cent offer."
"I love it. There's not much on the avs at all but I love pronman's prospect stuff, and I read all the other team articles. It's a nice way to get the viewpoint of all these other teams beat writers. 

There seems to be a boatload of STL, mtl, Toronto, cbj coverage."
Depends on the city. As an Oiler fan the content is worth it for sure.
Well worth it
"I think it is the best content available for the most part. Rarely do you get as in depth articles else where. 
"
"No, not a single person has one.

(To answer your question i personally really enjoy it)"
Montreal is great if you're bilingual 
Had it for a bit and there always never anything on the Coyotes... :/
NYI coverage has been outstanding recently.
It would definitely be nice to get more guys for the Sharks. We really only have like 3-4 guys who write about the Sharks in MSM and all that's really changed is that Kurz writes for The Athletic instead of CSN Bay Area. 
I was so happy he didn't even attempt to censor himself on Twitter the other night
"Yup, same for their podcast. They alternate between French episodes and English episodes."
Don't think they've expanded to cover arizona sports beyond the Diamondbacks yet. 
Olivier Bouchard's game recaps are my favourite thing on that site. So much info and data crammed in there it's amazing.
Yeah. I was just excited for better hockey coverage and it seems like it's 85% leafs.. 
"Yup, if you're a Habs fan and you want to learn French, the Athletic might be a nice way to do it"
I hope they eventually cover them. There's so little coverage of the yotes. 
I do too. I'm hoping they'll start covering all 31 teams.. 
I believe Mirtle had a tweet this week saying that they expect to be covering all teams by the end of the year.
"That kid at the beginning was FEELIN' IT, I love it"
"Detroit's 3v3 plan:  
- Skate forward  
- 180 drop pass  
- profit???
"
"Marchand now has 9G-7A-16P in his last 6 games against the Red Wings 

Edit: cause math is hard "
"The most Detroit thing to happen. Get down by 2 within the first minute, come back and then lose 20 seconds into OT. I love this team. "
I credit Livin' On a Prayer with rallying the hatty
Marchand is easily the most improved player in the last couple years. Gone from good top 6 forward to elite top 10 player in the NHL. Incredible. 
"Interesting experiment: Watch this three times. First, follow everything Larkin does. Second, follow everything Dekeyser does. Third, follow everything Mantha does."
"I know our defense is shit, but why is Jerad Coreau even given a chance anymore? Every game he hits the ice he's fucking shelled worse than a Syrian border town. "
Man the Garden was rockin’ when he scored. 
Liam is growin' up fast ain't he.
"Good job, good effort, Mantha."
"He’s such a great player to watch. Call him dirty all you want, he’s elite whether you like it or not."

thank you
Marchand has come so far. He gets better every year and I'm really happy his hard work is paying off. Go Bruins! 
"Love the lil self head tap that Marchand does.

>I got a hat-trick guys! "
Danny DeKeyser is fucking trash.
Only time will tell.  He does seem to be skating away from one on one incidents more than in the past.
That's [Liam Fitzgerald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTFWfcxwJ40) a young fan with Downs Syndrome and a Cancer Survivor.  Don't watch the 30 for 30 if you don't want to cry tonight
It's pretty much identical to our power play plan 
"Utilize speed because no one can really do zone entries since Datsyuk left. We have two of the fastest skaters in the league so it makes sense. 

edit: usually refs don't block zone entries causing a odd man rush the other way too"
This is the worst timeline. 
9+7=16
Yeah that guy really tears the Wings a brand new one each time they play
"People like to point to this and say ""see they're so close to being good"" but they're not. They're just bad. "
"You guys came back from being down 2, twice. Lmao "
"Part of it is just usage. Claude always used Marcheron as his shut down line. Something like 65% defensive zone starts. His power plays didn't rely on crisp passing, much more fire away from the point and look for rebounds so guys like Lucic, Horton, Iginla all fit the scheme better than him. 

It all changed when Pasta developed. While he is effective with anyone, his creativity with the other two's defensive prowess, Marchand's edgework/puck control, and Bergeron's situational awareness made them a offensive zone monster of a line. Claude had no choice but to give them more offensive zone starts and Marchand started to produce which got him PP time. When Cassidy came in, he changed the PP up a bit to run through Bergeron's bumper, cross ice passes, and Krug being extremely fluid in the offensive zone which helped bump his power play assists up a bit "
[deleted]
All three of them were so slow and half-hearted. 
"Because we need to give home more time to see if he find himself and can be an nhl goalie. If he can’t, we gotta find someone."
"I know, I can't believe he's 12 now"
Im willing to cut him some slack. He scored twice today. Plus I litteraly expect nothing from this team
"In the same vein call him elite all you want, he’s dirty whether you like it or not


Full disclosure I would kill to have Marchy on our team "
He did his job. Mantha and Larkin had great games but Marchand was their responsibility.
"Oh gosh, well now I have to honor the kid by watching "
"Ahhh I knew it! I was like, that's the fuckin fist bump kid. Growin like a weed, that one."
This one hurts
I really like it honestly 
"Ah, I see you went to the Kadri school of mathematics"
"Typically when we're ""So close to being good"" it's generally because the other team is playing poorly, lol."
Yup all good points and gotta say Pasta is a hell of a player too. His skill has facilitated Marchand's rise as well. 
"Franchise leader in OT goals, is that easier "
All three were exhausted. They all had great games. Nice goal though
"He gotten ""less"" dirty this season.   Takes time to adjust your emotions.  "
"I mean Larkins dump in hit a ref causing an odd man rush the other way, so I don't see how he can be blamed here (other than hitting the ref, lol)"
"I guess Larkin and Mantha were gassed from carrying 90% of the team tonight.

Overall big picture.  DDK is fucking garbage."
I hope you have tissues ready. 
Oh yeah. It's all smoke and mirrors haha
"not really, OT just started "
Except for the suspension...
"heheh, I wrote the same thing about Dustin Brown a year ago then he had a couple of doozy's this year.  Tigers don't lose their stripes, but both prefer winning, they'll just settle for injuring someone.

If a tree falls in the forest, does James Neal knee it in the head before it hits the ground?"
"Oh they totally blew coverage at the end. The dump in isn't Lark's fault but one of them should have taken Marchand. Mo floated and Lark drove the net to clear the rebound instead.

Don't get me wrong they both played amazing tonight, but they're not infallible."
"I'm preparing em, will let you know how it goes 

edit: that was really moving, god damn that's awsome! Kudos to the Bruins org for doing this"
"Well... They had also just played 60 minutes in which they probably we deployed far more than average considering Larkin is your best offensive threat, Mantha was a man on fire, and Dekeyser is your best defenseman "
You know they don’t rest before OT?  
"I just rewatched and you're totally right, he could/should have picked him up. "
