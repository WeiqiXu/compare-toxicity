EDIT:     
     
These are the emails of the 5 people on the FCC roster. These are the five people deciding the future of the internet.

The two women have come out as No votes. We need only to convince ONE of the other members to flip to a No vote to save Net Neutrality. Mike O'Rielly was hired by Obama so my guess is to go after him the most.

Blow up their inboxes!

Ajit Pai - Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov

Mignon Clyburn - Mignon.Clyburn@fcc.gov

Michael O'Rielly - Mike.ORielly@fcc.gov

Brendan Carr - Brendan.Carr@fcc.gov

Jessica Rosenworcel - Jessica.Rosenworcel@fcc.gov

Spread this comment around! We need to go straight to the source. Be civil, be concise, and make sure they understand that what they're about to do is UNAMERICAN."
"Also important to note: even if your senators and representatives are in favor of keeping Net Neutrality, please let them know that you support them and thank them for their efforts.

Positive feedback is sometimes even more important and lasting than negative feedback."
"I know this is getting spammed to pretty much every subreddit right now. It's extremely important, however, and the more people see it, the more people can take action.

If the FCC has its way, in December they will vote to completely eradicate the existing Net Neutrality rules, rules that force ISPs to treat all internet traffic the same. Without these rules, they can charge more for access to certain websites, throttle connections to competing services, and slow down streaming traffic unless you pay more for ""extra packages.""

Want to watch sports highlights online? They can limit your streaming rate to a crawl, and give you the generous options to increase your speeds for a mere extra $10.99 a month.

Fan of a team outside your area? Well if you ever want to watch their games online, you'll have to spring for the National Sports package to ""enable"" that.

Repealing Net Neutrality will allow ISPs to artificially hinder your Internet connection. It will let them charge you more to access various websites and competing services, in the name of grabbing more money. 

There is nothing consumer-friendly about repealing NN. It only benefits ISPs and corporations that have the cash to make deals with them to get preferential treatment. 

This means Comcast, who owns NBC, can make every intermission feature MIKE MILBURY, unless you fork over $4.99 per game to bypass it.

Do you want MIKE FUCKING MILBURY opening his sloppy butthole of a mouth between every period of every game you watch? If not, CONTACT YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND TELL THEM YOU DEMAND THEY SUPPORT THE EXISTING NET NEUTRALITY RULES, AND OPPOSE THEIR REPEAL. 

It's the only way to save Net Neutrality at this point.

Edit to add:

Resistbot. You literally just text ""resist"" to 50409 and it will walk you through a fully automated process that will let you look up your reps, draft a letter to them, then fax it to them for you. LET YOUR REPS KNOW WHERE YOU STAND!

"I wrote to Comcast's own senator Pat Toomey back in July and got a blah, blah...nope response from him.

"I’ve contacted my rep multiple times already to make my voice heard about protect net neutrality, like everyone who’s not the 3 buttholes voting to end it, i truly believe it’s important. But the prospect of Mike Milbury being on every intermission has double sold me on making my voice heard. "

"Ok since every sub from here to Timbuktu is going to spam about this obviously losing battle I'm gonna spam my own comment on all these posts, because I'm tired of the slacktivism.

It's time to stop fighting this at the federal level. There are tons of state governments that have outlawed local ISPs etc. What's the point of having a neutral internet if the internet bill is $120/mo because the only ISP you have is Comcast? My point is it's easier to organize against local representatives, so do it. If your state has a law against competitive internet service practices (some common examples include disallowing local utilities from offering internet service), write your state senator and state delegate/congressman to push them to introduce legislation to reopen competition for internet service in your state. Get all your friends on board. Protest at their offices and vote them out/run against them/recruit someone to run against them if they don't change the law. If your state doesn't have these laws, great! Push your local representatives to pass net neutrality laws in your state. If they don't, follow the guide above. If you live in a city of >50,000, push your city council to put together a net neutrality ordinance, forbidding ISPs from engaging in this anti-competitive practice.

The old saying goes, all of politics is local. If we have 28 or 30 states where net neutrality is codified into state law the FCC will have to take a more permanently pro-consumer stance on this."

"Unpopular opinion I know, but net neutrality seems to me overkill when they should have been enforcing anti-competition laws already on the books. The internet isn’t the only place these kinds of businesses do this kind of thing. Also make it illegal to create a local monopoly with local governments. Net neutrality just seem like another way to control something that cannot be controlled."
They better not take away my online streaming.

"Honestly this is basic freedom stuff. Imagine if the phone provider you use could listen in to your calls and simply disconnect you if they didn’t like your conversation for whatever reason. If there were no net neutrality rules then Comcast could simply prevent you from reading online articles which are critical of the company. Given that most ISPs are government subsidized local monopolies, this more than smacks of fascism. "

"Tens of thousands of public comments on the FCC website telling them not to end Net Neutrality didn't get through to Ajit Pai's thick skull and money-covered ears, and they're on the verge of voting to end it. So why the fuck would calling members of a Congress that's very close to cutting taxes on the rich and raising taxes on just about everyone else suddenly work? As a country, we made our bed and we're gonna have to lie in it. Am I cynical? Am I pessimistic? Yes to both, but I also don't see any other way this shakes out.

The only redeeming feature is if they show a sense of humor and charge $14.88 a month to access Twitter."

"Quality thread title lol, well done."
"Example of a Canadian company doing what many companies will do if Net Neutrality is repealed: https://t.co/3AZlmAadQv

Even I did it
"Can I file a complaint with the FCC against the FCC?

Their site states:

The FCC's Open Internet rules protect and maintain open, uninhibited access to lawful online content. The rules specifically prohibit:

Blocking: Broadband providers may not block access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices.

Throttling: Broadband providers may not deliberately target some lawful internet traffic to be delivered to users more slowly than other traffic.

Paid prioritization: Broadband providers may not favor some internet traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind.  Internet service providers are also banned from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.

The rules also put in place standards going forward to ensure that ISPs cannot engage in new or different practices—outside those three prohibitions—that would cause similar harms to the open internet.  

The rules apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service to protect your internet access.

Good to hear us sticking together. This is like pulling the goalie with less than a minute to go in Game 7. Hopefully we can get the shit done and Net Neutrality can still be here for years to come.

Tell them that's not how you do that ~~hockey~~ Internet!
So does that mean I won't be able to illegally stream stuff now? 
We don't need this in every fucking subreddit.
"Absolutely contact your reps about this. Because after all, it's a fucking democracy. 

Good news is, this is likely not to be as awful as people think it will be for a couple reasons. 

The first being that pre 2015, the internet had no protections for net neutrality and it went on relatively fine. No packaged bundles, no throttling hardly, and no other bullshit. 

the second being Trump. We all know Trump is a low IQ, possibly deranged moron. He hates literally everything with the slightest tie to Obama and must destroy it because reasons. Since he appointed Pai there's a really good chance this turns into another bullshit page in Trump's crusade against Obama's legacy and ends up being repealed for the sake of repealing it. Kinda like how we all worried America would become a dictatorship/business paradise under Trump and a whole lot of nothing has happened. 

Third, and probably the most likely thing is this repeal isn't used to fuck the consumer. Instead, the telecomms go after the source of their rise in cord cutting; the big dogs of streaming like Netflix, Hulu, etc to rake them over the coals with more fees. A good old fashion corporate in-fighting charged battle royale! 

**That being said, this is just all speculation. I'm going to bold this and still say contact your reps and still make your voice heard just on the fact the FCC is basically ignoring everyone going ""yeah no, we don't want that.""** "
Nah drag it out in court.

 Repealing Net Neutrality will allow ISPs to artificially hinder your Internet connection. It will let them charge you more to access various websites and competing services, in the name of grabbing more money.
 There is nothing consumer-friendly about repealing NN. It only benefits ISPs and corporations that have the cash to make deals with them to get preferential treatment.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/225/928/a11.jpg)

"A good way to put it, imo, would be this: You pay $159.99 for NHL Gamecenter, and you expect to be able to access it at all times, but now you also have to pay your ISP $199.99 for streaming services, or access to sports sites, or else you might not even be able to connect to Gamecenter. "

Dude I can’t fucking *stand* Mike Milbury.  I just texted “resist”to 50409
"Mods can we get a sticky for this?  We gotta keep this post at the top of r/hockey.

Side note:  I wonder if any NHL teams would consider taking a stand and show their support for net neutrality.  Perhaps tweeting from the teams official Twitter account, and or a pre game announcement and video on the scoreboard?  I know some owners probably have investments in Comcast, ATT, Verizon etc and would not do it, but I'm sure theres gotta be some owners that could swing it.  Plus, if a team that needs a bump in fans (Arizona, Florida, Carolina I'm looking at you) were to truly come out and help lead the brigade against taking away net neutrality, it could win some serious support from the millennial fan base, which it seams every pro sports league is trying to cater to."
I’m glad it’s getting spammed. It’s important.
Thank you sir
"Thank you for posting this. I feel somewhat helpless here in Canada, but I know how important this battle is to win. Not only because if net neutrality goes to shit south of the border, we're very likely next. 

Keep it up, USA friends. We can't let this shit happen. And we've all seen the positive impact that Reddit can make. "
I'm honestly surprised the post calls out Tim Peel and not Mike Milbury. 
I'm sure you're getting spammed but this is great and you've motivated me. Cheers.
Is there anything Canadian fans can do for you guys?
tbh I'd pay $4.99 to guarantee I never had to see Mike Milbury in intermission again

"You're right, it is spam.  That's exactly the right word for it.  Just because you really want to talk about something, doesn't mean you can just spam it on unrelated boards until you get your way."

I'm not american but I'm happy to see this covering reddit. It better make some news and turn heads.
Your argument against a law shouldn't be that it'll make illegal activity harder
Maybe not the best message considering piracy is one of the arguments against net neutrality.
"oh, no. No more illegal piracy?

woe is me.."
Oh wow

"But...  Ted Cruze told me Net Neutrality was ""Obamacare for the Internet""...  And all his twitter followers agreed..."
"Worse, even. Cable is bound by contracts with hundreds of channels, networks, and other providers. The Internet is not bound by any such bundling. They could conceivably charge you a fee for ""sports media"" but they could go further and charge you by sport, or even by team. 

Another aspect is if one network decided to make a lucrative deal with an ISP, and as a result of that, the ISP limited or outright blocked traffic to competing networks, unless of course you pay a fee. This gets brought up a lot with things like Netflix vs Hulu, but is applicable to just about every category of web traffic."

I'd pay that now. I wasn't aware that it was an option.
"This is true, however there isn't a lot non-US fans can do right now, besides supporting companies who also support Net Neutrality rules.

To take note, though: if NN is repealed in the US and viewers as a success by the government and the corporations in favor, other countries will absolutely use it as a blueprint.

If you're curious as to a real-life example, look as what Portugal's internet packages look like right now."

"Actually, the rules are from 2004 (when GW was President). 2014 simply made it the unambiguous job of the FCC to enforce them.

"A lot of internet companies we rely on in Canada are US based. You can bet your ass that if the US sets a precedent for them to bust down net neutrality, it'll be on its way up here. 

Even in the mildest scenario, any streaming from american sites, or games with their servers in the states will be affected by this."
"Indirectly, to be sure. The biggest impact is to how ISP customers are allowed to access the internet, which obviously doesn't apply to non-customers of US ISPs.

However, if NN is repealed and the government tours it as a success, bet your bottom dollar that other governments will be lobbied hard by their own ISPs and connection providers to implement the same system."
"One of the things Net Neutrality is supposed to protect against is ISPs demanding websites pay them so that costumers can access their site. 

An example of this is when Comcast slowed down Netflix's connection speeds until Netflix agreed to pay what was basically ransom.  This technically didn't violate Net Neutrality because it had to do with interconnection between Netflix and Comcast. But the same idea applies. 

ISP would basically be free to hold businesses hostage and the result is a tiered internet. Some websites have a fast connection, others don't. Only the biggest companies that can afford to deal with the ISPs can thrive. Meanwhile, startups and small companies would have a hard time competing with websites that load much faster, particularly when dealing with things like video streaming. It creates a barrier of entry for web-based businesses. 

The result? Less variety for consumers like us (anyone who accesses sites in the US) and a lower quality of content due lack of completion. "

"Looks like they’re overloaded. Just got the following response: Apologies, but I'm on fire right now! Please text RESIST again later. In the meantime, please donate to help me build capacity:"
It actually sends a letter with your name and address at the top. 
Calling is still the best option. Unfortunately I’ve gotten no response :/
Voicemails are filling up.  I've heard that faxing is the way to go and requires a response.
[Read the FAQ](https://resistbot.io/about.html). This service doesn't send anonymous messages and it doesn't send templated messages. 
So can I call even as an international student?
"Nope it actually drafts an official letter with letterhead and your name and address on it. 

It faxes it and sends you the confirmation "
ninja edit: I texted it but it is overloaded at the moment. It also seems to not work for w few people so idk about that
It should respond to you
"You put in your name, address, and body of your letter, and it formats the letter and faxes it to your representatives. You can choose senate, house reps, both senate and house reps, governor, and president. "
Well it hasn’t been passed yet 
Are your representative and your senators Democrats? They almost certainly support this. Are they Republicans? Call and try to change their minds. This issue is pretty much straight down party lines. 
"Realistically, I'm sure there's a compiled resource somewhere that shows lawmakers historic stances on NN. Try /r/KeepOurNetFree maybe?"

"I debated trying to inject some cheesy hockey-related terms in the post but the best I came up with is ""Don't let the FCC give Net Neutrality a game misconduct!""

/r/all is literally nothing but Net Neutrality posts. Something like only 2 of the top 30 aren't NN related.

"Can't us non-Americans do anything? Will our comments count if we go to the FCC/Comments site? It's absolutely criminal that this is going on, and it's frustrating to have to watch from the sidelines. I mean, what's to say this won't affect or spread to us? This is nuts."

"The Star Wars game only got a temporary change to avoid hurting holiday sales, it's a bit different with a commercial product like that.

Net neutrality is a great cause but the front page being plastered with the same message is just Reddit being an echo chamber. I'm wondering how much it actually helps, how many people are actually calling because of that, and if calls even matter when we're facing lobbyists on the opposition who fund the politicians being called. 

Edit: My point is what is the number of US based Redditors seeing those messages and calling compared to the rest of each delegate's constituency? We see a lot of posts with a lot of upvotes, but a lot of the same people are upvoting those posts - and a lot of people who aren't in the US. A fraction of those users are in a position to do something, and only a fraction of those yet are going to do something. Compare that to the number of citizens under each representative who are not calling, don't know, don't care, and all the money funneling into their pockets from lobbyists. It's overly optimistic to think flooding the front page is making a significant difference, the message needs to be spread out to other sites not just other subs within this site. I say Reddit is an echo chamber because it is. It sounds real loud in here where almost everyone agrees, preaching to the choir isn't as productive as going out to other outlets to spread the message instead."
"Indeed, it paints [quite a picture](https://imgur.com/a/mZV7R)

"Their statement was only supporting Net Neutrality in name.  They went on to say that they opposed Title II, then claimed that it was hurting them, despite previously saying they were doing great after the new rules.  None of this should be surprising - this is potentially their gateway to even greater abuse-driven profits, so they have heavy incentive to sow confusion and misinfo about it.  "
My sweet summer child
Isn't the whole idea of the deep web is that it can't be cracked by government parties. That's why Chinese and north Koreans use it.
They will likely restrict bandwidth so even if you can access it....you'd pay through the nose for it...
Until they just flat out block any traffic that isn't whitelisted.
"Yeah, but I want to watch hockey without worrying about accidentally stumbling on CP."
"How about this:  Without net neutrality your ISP can charge you more to specifically access NHL.TV.  They can charge Sling or any other streaming service more for unthrottled access to their end customers, Sling will then be forced to pass the added cost on to you.

The lack of net neutrality regulations allows large ISP's to double dip and drive up prices for interconnects everywhere else forcing smaller ISP's without leverage to raise rates or fold.  They currently only charge their own customers for service, but under these new rules they would also be able to discriminate based on what data is being transferred and where it is coming and going; thus allowing them to also charge the content producers or even worse deploy disgusting anti-consumer practices like this shit https://www.meo.pt/internet/internet-movel/telemovel/pacotes-com-telemovel

Right now the internet is an actual free market with an incredibly low barrier to entry.  You just need a website and an internet connection and you have access to billions of potential customers.  If we remove net nuetrality, a start-up may have to pay not only their own ISP for access, but they may also have to pay every single network owner between their datacenter and their end customer.  Retransmission and long distance fees just like telephone and cable all over again.  This shit is going to kill the internet and e-commerce as we know it. "
"How much extra are you willing to pay to be on NHL.com? Or even a sports journalist site for the Devils?

$12.99 per site?

If no, then NN needs your help protecting it."

The Senators as well. Not saying which ones. 
Didn't the government rule in net neutrality for us last year? 
"More regulation makes new competition more difficult.  Canadian businesses like regulation to keep competition down and use the lack of competition to gouge customers, while American businesses dislike regulation so they can lower their costs to make extra money and not being too worried about the side-effects."
Didnt they strike it down in the states before too?

"I'd be fine with my ISP offering streaming packages that bundle actual content together with big data caps. Sell me a Minnesota sports package that gives me fiber speed with streaming subscriptions to FSNorth and Fox45, but don't limit my access and speed to those things if I decide to use those individual services with a normal service package.

And thats the thing. They'd make a killing by doing this without having to moderate the actual access to the internet. But ISPs don't want to provide convenient alternatives in a cord-cutting world when forcing people to pay through the nose for existing services will drive people back to the dying cable TV industry so they can make money both ways."

"You really should check all the options NHL Center Ice offers now. There's the Kessel eating a Hot Dog package. The Reaves pranking Kessel package. There's Malkin pranking Kessel package.

"So the one time I went to a hockey game was pretty cool but the story beings at the end, see I drank so much beer I knew I had to pee so I tried my best to relieve myself leaving the game but we went to the stadium by train so we had to take one back to get to the car. As the train was leaving I started to feel the sensation again like I had to go but the train had other plans, it wanted to stop and I only wanted to go. The conductor said it might be a few minutes before we go again but my bladder could not, the pressure began to build to unreasonable levels, why had my bladder decided to bring upon me such pain at an inconceivable time in beyond me. I had already tried my best to relieve myself but my bladder had other plans, as if some cosmic intervention the train and my pee had conspired against me. I was in pain by the time the train had started moving again. It may have been only 30 minutes or so but to me it was an eternity. There was still the slow ride back to the car. By the time we had gotten back to my friends car it was go time and I had to go behind the trees and the feeling of relief could only be described as heavenly, I don't think my first experience of coitus could be comparable by any measure. The relief I felt at that moment might be the best and worse thing that ever happened to me.  "

"Oh lighten up, they fixed it not long after I posted that comment."
"Yeah, I did the same on /r/startups 

It works very well. 

I would prefer all the subs to be crafting the message a bit more to their audience. Then, as you scan /r/all you would get hit with a greater gravity of just how many things it will affect.

Much more impactful."
This website is overwhelmingly liberal/democrat.
Right? I feel like in some ways the democrats are further right then the conservative party. Or at least the conservative party 5 years ago
"People in certain demographics have been brainwashed for decades by talk radio and fox news to an unthinkable degree.  Unrelenting propaganda machines funded by billionaires like Stephen Mercer.  

Also, conservatives are a minority in this country.  Republicans win major elections only because the majority of oung and/or liberal people can't be bothered to vote, while republicans (esp old people) prioritize voting."
"Republicans usually fall into 3 categories; The rich, the old, and the uneducated.  These people don't use reddit, they use facebook.  Visit American Facebook, it is the worst."
"Republicans aren't the only ones gerrymandering and doing voter suppression. Democrats are just as guilty of gerrymandering (look at Chicago if you don't believe me). It's been a good few months, how's the outside influences and collusion narrative holding up? It's going to be hilarious to watch that one blow up on your faces.

Roy Moore NEVER molested anyone, all accusations against him were unproven and false. It pains me how you can hate a man for something he never did. So unreasonable! Also your partisan lines argument is bullshit. Jeff Flake is a Republican Senator from Arizona and he said he'd rather see Jones over Moore. Get real dude, Reddit is not an accurate representation of the real world lol. Amazing how you bring up Jones going after the KKK, but when Sessions went after the KKK all anyone could ever say was ""he's racist! reeeeeee.""  

Why not talk about the FBI investigation into Conyers? Because you're a hypocrite, that's why. "
Which is why younger people need to get involved in local politics.
Also the federal government is pretty likely to pass laws forbidding states from doing just that. They only believe in states rights to discriminate. 
"And that's fine, but nobody is even trying to push local and state legislatures to do away with anti-competition laws that basically legally enforce a Comcast monopoly. Banning local utilities from even providing internet service is a purely local/state issue that the FCC is doing nothing about (largely because it can't)."
Oh? 
"It sends a fax, which representatives are supposed to keep track of their constituents comments and views on issues."

No. It also gives you a choice to send a fax or a letter.
"Thanks bud, I find this whole ordeal to be whack. "
Thanks.  F*ck these a**holes then.  I've sent a letter to my House representative (Comstock - R).
"personally I think the US should do what we have here in Canada. You can charge more for whatever you want, have your own payment system, however you must treat all content equally. i.e. ISPs can't block FaceTime or anything."
"So if, say, Netflix gets throttled in the States, will its speeds in Canada get throttled too?  Because if that's the case, it sucks how there's literally nothing we could do about that, not even pay for a ""fast lane"" like what I've heard could happen in the States."

"One user made a whole big stink and held a thread he made for people attending patriots games (updated/maintained it, pretty useful too, seemed like good content) hostage. Because he thought the move was just a political move by the mods.

I suppose it is political by its nature, but god damn it, it's potentially a very real problem for those of us that watch on the internet. Earlier this year I was close to my data cap due to some large purchases after an xbox store sale.

The thing was that I had no idea I had a data cap. That shit was traumatic having to watch over adults (housemates) because we have some sort of cap for some reason. Like there's a drought of internet.

And basically for the last 10-11 days of April, I couldn't really watch any hockey anymore, I couldn't watch any basketball anymore. No nothin because of that god damned cap."
"Also Trump would veto NN protections.

Politics isn't a sport.
"I love how some people talk about politics like it's a sport that doesn't personally affect your life.

So no net-neutrality means that I’ll lose access to the internet? That’s a decent way to scaremonger people.
My god no one is going to lose their internet access. NN wasn’t a thing up until two years ago and nothing happened before then. This is all fear mongering.

"No, the deep web just refers to any sites that aren't indexed by search engines. Like you can open another browser tab right now and go to your email - you are in the deep web.

"Everything you said about conservatives being brainwashed for decades can be said about liberals/democrats. The entire MSM media machine is corrupt and works with the DNC, WikiLeaks proved that lol. It's so funny how we go after one side of the country yet completely forget that the other side is just as guilty. Conservatives are most definitely not a minority in this country, especially when you go into single issue problems. While gay marriage is legal, many issues like marijuana legalization and abortion are still opposed by a good chunk of the population (at least 40%+).

"Im not sure about that tbh. 

My gut says that if it got throttled in the states we'd likely face some kind of slowdown up here as a result"
"No.  That sort of throttling would be covered by Netflix's ISP and they're pretty much already allowed to charge what they want to give them the bandwidth they need.

And with the Netflix example it doesn't even really matter.  Companies like them have cache's set up more locally anyway.  Think about it, when a new season of Netflix's most popular show comes out Rogers and Bell and them don't really want to deal with all of their customers clogging up their entire network with the same stuff being sent to everyone.  Instead they get it put on their own servers and people can get it from them.  It's faster and more reliable for the customers and doesn't clog up the ISP's network.  The cost is in the extra servers and storage the ISP needs, but they work deals out with netflix and the benefits for them are pretty nice.

And if US based services become unusable because of the net neutrality thing then that's just what everyone who relies on international customers is going to do, get servers set up outside the US."
"For large, legal services like Netflix I don't *think* (could be wrong though) we'll have speed issues in canada. 

But for all the small websites, servers etc that are USA based we'll feel it big time. "
"Amazon doesn't have any physical server infrastructure in Canada. So... Yes, anything in the US between you and Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu (all of which run on AWS), could absolutely throttle the connection because it's not going to a ""preferred"" destination. (And yes, the internet backbone companies are scummy enough to do this, they're just not as visible as the ISPs.) 

Another poster mentioned local caches on your ISP's part, which will mitigate it for popular content. But want to watch foreign independent films on Netflix? Forget that. "

If the ISP is having problems with upstream bandwidth, then they need to:
A. upgrade infrastructure

B. Stop selling bandwidth packages they cannot accommodate

C. stop over subscribing


The internet is successful because customers only have to pay for their own connection to get access to everywhere.  If they had to pay for their own connection as well as each destination, then it wouldn't be the internet, it would be stupid."

The regulatory body has usually been granted ""ministerial authority"" by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality, as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.

The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content.

"Sure, my bad. 100k isn't rich where you live I guess. Voters who earned 250k or above voted in the same percentages for Trump and Clinton. Winning 53% of the 65+ vote isn't exactly a huge landslide, it's 3 percentage points away from being a dead 50/50 split. College graduates voting for Hillary by 4 percentage points again relates to the 65+ vote in which it isn't a huge victory. You said uneducated, but it seems the educated voted for Trump in a similar amount as Clinton's educated vote did. You seem to act as if a few percentage points means the entire country is one way or the other, when in reality there were many crossover votes with blue collar jobs and yes, college millennials even.

This is Mexico right now without NN

Priced based on Websites you use! Home Internet priced based on Data used!

And No, the prices arent cheaper than they were. And In accordance with this, the FCC removed rules about consolidation of TV stations and News print media. How long before Comcast is the ONLY ISP in America, government protected?"
"Wrong again. Repealing NN does nothing more to benefit small ISPs than the existing rules do, and since current ISPs have all the fiber, poles, and right of way, it will still mean new ISPs have to pay exorbitant fees to said ISP for usage of those resources.

In the rare case that a new ISP can compete, all the current ISP has to do is lower their own prices to make the new ISP unable to compete, wait until they go out of business, and then raise the prices right up.

This has happened before, it is the current standard of business in the world of ISPs. Repealing NN does nothing to help this."
"ah yes, the classic trickle down bullshit people keep shoveling into their mouths to justify giving corporations more control. A classic.

All you have to do is imply that you might save money and people will eat that shit up so quickly. Hell, they'll start shoveling it directly into every orifice of their body regardless of how true it is or not. It doesn't even have to save you money, you just need to imply to people that it does and morons will guzzle that shit up like mad."
"Wow.

Because the current ISP monoliths are so encouraging of competition. Even Google got held up in litigation by Comcast.

Christ."
"Actually, that's not what happened.

The current policy (not law) enforcing net neutrality was implemented as a response to a legal challenge in which the ISPs fought the FCC over whether or not they had the right to enforce neutrality on them as a Title I entities. The FCC reclassified them as a Title II entities in 2015 to shut down the complaint.

So to recap:

* Prior to 2015, ISPs were Title I entities, and the FCC wouldn't let them charge more for selective access (meaning we had net neutrality).
* The ISPs (correctly) challenged the FCC's authority to do so under existing law.
* In 2015, the FCC realized that the ISPs had a solid legal argument, so in order to preserve the status quo, reclassified the ISPs as Title II entities.
* Now, in 2017, the ISP's are petitioning to be classified as Title I again, using the argument that ""things were fine before"".

**They can't have it both ways.** Things were only fine before because the FCC enforced neutrality on them. The FCC reclassified them only to preserve the status quo and continue to enforce net neutrality."
Because they do the jobs they are supposed to do... and that second sentence just proves you are a clueless moron on the subject. Anyone with half a brain knows this is not a partisan issue.

"I quickly read that article and he's lying, he is a shill. The tell tale signs are he goes to great lengths to say he's not a shill, and he then goes into the old, very old, and tired arguments of how corps are bad but gov is worse. Not saying the gov is any good but he completely disregards the fact that people actually want this.

They've been using the exact same arguments for 100's of years.

And if gov is so bad then how can they make any right decision? Only when it fits him.

Corps are bad. Gov is bad. The only thing that might ever be in your favour will come from the gov because at least you got a vote, never ever from a corp.

Keep in mind this isn't about money, it's about control, content control. Why do these guys go to such great lengths?

1). Im not gate keeping.  It’s just obvious you have never made a post in r/hockey prior.  Now you come into a hockey sub to have political discussion.  Lol ok, no biases that you’d go out of you way to enter a hockey sub to bend over backwards to defend dems

2). Thanks everyone on reddit knows what net neutrality is.  You especially don’t have to explain it to me.  I’m sure I’m more well versed on the subject than you are.  I’m an IT professional.

3). And most importantly.  I’ve said this already.  It was introduced by a republican and supported by republicans because they are the majority.  SOPA on the other hand was almost all dems because they were the majority.  How is it that you can just shake what the dems do off as sometimes shady but they cave.  But when the reps do it, they are just the worst party in the world.  Might as well be hitler.  That’s not fair and your bias is so blatant it’s ridiculous.  

Almost all politics make shady deals based on money.  Dem or Rep.  doesn’t matter.  "

"Really? Because its not like there was Abuse before 2015:

Net neutrality laws were put in place in response to ISPs anti-consumer tactics.  

Here's a few times those ""unspoken rules"" were broken before we had net neutrality.
From a previous post by /u/Skrattybones :  

2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.  

2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.  

2007-2009 - AT&T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones.  

2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)  

2011-2013, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace  

2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)  

2012, AT&T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.  

2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.

I should add too, how are any of those links comparable to what changes you're proposing. I don't see any evidence of a provider adding content plans like you've shown in the Mexico example. Almost all of your links wouldn't affect the day-to-day of the average person at all.

And even if they did, disregarding monopolistic areas (as that's a problem of its own), wouldn't the more profitable company provide similar services we know and love knowing that any rational consumer would prefer such a service if it is costs less? "

 * Nazis are ""fine people""

 * military transgender ban (not race, but discriminatory in the same fashion)

 * refers to the confederacy as our great heritage

 * pardoning Arpaio, signalling that latin american internment camps are an admirable use of police resources and authority

"Also, if I may add: Fuck Trump."
"I was at this game. The person/people who run the Jumbotron should receive all of the praise. Not only was this part funny but their ability to find the perfect reference for what was happening during the game was admirable. While a play was under review, they played the anticipation scene from Apollo 13, and when the goal was confirmed, the Jumbotron skipped to the celebration scene.  "
Man even Texas is taking jabs at you as a rep. Ouch.

Reddit is freaking out at an overestimate. A number. Let that sink in.
"Guess I'm one of the only ones but this is crazy political. It's about a major event that happened, not so much for one party or another. It got so many upvotes for a reason yet so many people are upset with seeing political posts in /hockey. No one complained about the several other posts of the Stars Jumbotron. 
Edit: Search /hockey for Obama and you'll find a bunch of posts about him with the cup winning teams and lockouts. IMO those are much more political than this. Read those comments though and you'll find very little people complaining. Then there is [this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/49tn6i/damn_obama_just_roasted_canada_and_our_prime/?st=IY8WUWWB&sh=df86dd7a) with Canada's prime minister and America's president.

"Someone please explain this to this hockey-loving Canadian here, who isn't caught up on American news at all. I was filing a formal complaint against that guy who I was playing hockey with, who also worked at McDonalds, who gave me one less cheese curd on my poutine than usual.

Not only that, but Trump went on to put a picture of the crowd at Obama's inauguration (2 million plus) as his own on his Twitter cover photo before people noticed it and they he had it replaced.

"Trump and company are very insecure about the lack of attendance for his inauguration and lied about how many people were there (Trump said 1.5 million when it was actually 600,000 as the highest estimate, most were protesters).

Put a god damn monkey, a literal chimpanzee, and Trump would not have won."
And a team from Texas at that.
Isn't Dallas pretty liberal? I know for a fact that Austin is like one of the most liberal cities in the US.
And for some reason his ignorant following can't understand it
He probably loves hockey.  It's almost all white men and lots of Russians.
"Well the real litmus test is gonna be the NBA. The NBA is a black league, not just in number but in culture as well.

Tim Thomas will go now if someone invited him.
"Not like he'd need to invite Dallas, anyway."

"""Four more years"" means something totally different today. "
It's less a jab and more a topical joke. Dallas has a great social media and in house team. I highly recommend their twitter account. 
"Yeah, a jab on a jumbotron at an NHL game is definitely the best way to get back at him. /s"
A Canadian team could actually win a Stanley Cup?

"I know I'm going to get downvoted for it but I didn't find it that funny. Tumbler (and parts of reddit for that matter) are the ones who get offended by things that shouldn't even be offensive. 

The #OscarsTooWhite was a great example of this. When Trump was talking about unity and said ""Black, Brown, and White"", r/politics freaked out that he forgot Asians.

While I don't agree that a million people attended the inauguration, I find it interesting that an overestimate caused this much furor from the left.

This is a divided country, and the constant bashing of parties and supporters is not going to help.

Trump and co lied about the inauguration day attendance - saying it was one of the most highly-attended inaugurations. 
"Like 250,000 people when to his inauguration but he said 1.5 million went "
"Basically, yesterday, Trump bragged about there being 1.5 million people at his inauguration (official first day as president) when there were maybe around 600k people in reality. It's just how he fuels his unquenchable narcissism, by making up shit and gaslighting everyone.

Not only that, but Trump went on to put a picture of the crowd at Obama's inauguration (2 million plus) as his own on his Twitter cover photo before people noticed it and they he had it replaced."
You are going to get this every day until he's impeached. Strap in.

If you look at the top comments, there are multiple basically calling trump supporters dumb. I didn't vote for the guy, but seeing comments that only serve to divide the community like that make me feel like this is an unwelcoming subreddit. This sub is for hockey discussion, and I feel like this post has mostly gotten away from that. "
"Trump claimed 1.5 million people came to the inauguration. 

Visual evidence contradicts that severely. 

The protests today were much bigger. Trump's White House PR stooge went on tv to deny the obvious. "
At the ceremony they only had between 10-20 thousand people but Trump claimed it was much higher.

"Broke-ass liberals, too.  We're scared he's going to actually do what conservatives imagined Obama did.   (You know, destroy the country.) 

So we make fun of him because he's an easily distracted/offended child (along with most of his supporters) in the hopes that he'll just angrily tweet at us.

If we keep that up, maybe he won't be able to turn the clock back on what we all enjoy in modern society. Open Internet, women's health, National Parks, health care, LGBT rights, human rights in general. 

Not to mention that besides Putin and the white nationalist leaders of Europe, Trump's a punchline at best. At worst, he holds the keys to tanking the entire world economy. (You realize he's had more properties go bankrupt than most people have had hot meals, right? Rich Vos' joke: ""You know why Trump puts his name on all his buildings? That way the banks know which ones to take back."")

Sorry guys. Tired of the champagne liberal garbage. 

Also, don't pretend we didn't just finish 8 years of racist nonsense aimed at Obama. (Go back to Kenya, Michelle looks like a gorilla, the FUBO clothing line and bumper stickers, pretty much every Obama meme your uncle shares on Facebook.) 

We still hear Bill Clinton BJ jokes, and it's been 20 years.  Those jokes are a year away from being able to legally drink. 

Trump won, it's his time in the barrel. He works for all Americans now, not just the ones that voted for him."

Bizarre. Politics is the one thing everyone ought to be involved in. 
The fact you've spent zero time before now in any hockey sub suggests this is a lie.

But your summary is typical of the nonsense Trump disseminates all the time, so I'm not too surprised by this. You can't base your entire view of a large group based on one or two selected observations, unlike Trumps views of abortion.

"Don't think of it as caring about the actual attendance; the President of the United States is accusing every news organization around the world of falsifying facts about his inauguration.

"To me the funniest part of the whole situation is Trump supporters posting pictures of the worst possible angles to try to compare to Obama's. in this case the camera on the right blocks off most of the mall.

There is timelapse video of the whole day. The stuff about the pictures being taken too early was not true. Verify it. Numbers are known.

Could you possibly put a source on your numbers? I know obamas first inauguration had a bigger turnout than Trump's but I think you're a bit inaccurate on your calculation of 600k. The pictures they've released surely can't tell us how many people were there.
"Crowd scientists (yes, they are a real thing) estimated Trump's inauguration crowd at [160,000](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/22/us/politics/womens-march-trump-crowd-estimates.html?_r=0)."
Stop fucking using the term gaslighting please 
"Actually, he said it *looked* like 1-1.5 million but also said it could've been 250k people which still would've been decent due to the weather. He brought that up because the media said Trump didn't draw a big crowd. From where he was standing, it looked a like the place was packed.

If you [look at this interactive picture](http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/), it's hard to blame him."

But it was. With an estimated crowd of crowd of 700k - 900k it would be the third or fourth most attended inauguration.

Obama drew 1.8 million in 2009, and 1.1 million in 2013. Slick Willy drew a crowd of 800k

Obama was an anomaly who attracted record amounts of people to the voting booth. Many of those people are in demographics that typically are not very politically active. The numbers Obama pulled may never be reached again.

"600k at a women's match? 

Great to see that women's sports are gaining this kind of traction."
God. So many downvotes for saying something true. 
"Trump's people are the ones who made a big deal out of the difference in numbers, and lied about theirs being bigger. Everything you say about the demographics of DC is true, as well as the fact that the 1st black president was a historic event. So... why wouldn't Trump just say that instead of making up stupid bullshit? THAT is the issue here."
lol do you know what sub you're in? Have you ever even watched a game of hockey in your life?
"Funny you mention that it was a work day. Obama's inauguration in 2008 was on a Tuesday. Also, workdays never stopped people from attending trump's rallies. I thought people voted for him specifically because they didn't have jobs, anyways? Or maybe attendance was lower because Obama oversaw 8 years of unprecedented job growth?

"The Indy Fuel is an affiliate for the Chicago Blackhawks. Tickets are very cheap and they play at the fairgrounds. For the NHL, you've got Chicago Blackhawks, Columbus Blue Jackets and the Nashville predators all within a weekend game drive with Nashville being the furthest."
I'm in the same boat - don't have a team I like since there isn't one here in Indiana.

If you want different options, the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues, Nashville Predators, and Columbus Blue Jackets are all relatively close. 

Chicago has been the best team in the league for a number of years now, while Columbus has been the best team of the group this season."

Yeah I was there and I didn't get it until I saw this post and neither did anyone I was with. Not much of a reaction by the crowd

"That was in an actual city though...Trump did terrible in almost every city, losing major ones like NY, Philly, DC and LA at rates of like 92-8.  I think Dallas and other southern cities were a little closer, but 80-20 isn't really impressive either."
If the average Republican was informed enough to get the joke then the joke likely wouldn't exist in the first place because we wouldn't be here.
"My husband likes to remind me, every time I make fun of Texas, that they were closer to voting blue than where we live (Ohio) or where I'm from (Pennsylvania).

Unsure how true that is.  Maybe that's just Dallas (which is where he's from)."
Sad! 
Geez.......
That press conference was at like 6:00 though. Many people going to the game probably didn't see it. 
Probably would have done better to day. Willing to bet a lot of people weren't paying attention to the news cause they were going to a hockey game. 
Eh. I've been paying attention to the news and knew Trump had been blowing up the numbers for his inauguration crowd but I still don't think I would have gotten it for a while. I didn't know the number he quoted was 1.5M. 
I was at the game as well but must have missed it.  They also did a bit about the NSA and Russia that was relatively well received. 
Or didn't find it funny.
No one has more respect for their fans than I do. No one.

The CIA isn't supposed to do domestic stuff, but I'm pretty sure a huge slice of the CIA's staff knows that the simple, physical reality was that inauguration turnout was low.  As a result, they know that the reporting was accurate.  Why on earth would Trump spout bullshit to an organization of fact checkers about inaccurate reporting on a fairly straight forward fact?  What the actual fuck is going on with him?"
Is that a challenge? 
"Actually, Obama changed his presidential handle from @POTUS to @POTUS44 and an @POTUS was created for Trump with that handle freed up. All of Obama's presidential tweets are @POTUS44, which used to be named @POTUS."

"Trump supporters will always be able to make some kind of excuse for defending Trump's lies. There were time lapse videos, comparison photos, tv viewership comparisons.

The issue isn't the picture was at a different time because they were only an hour apart and the field looked the same both hours.

The issue is Trump thinking he can blatantly deny and lie about anything and everything and get away with it."
"Just a heads up: DC's population is ~600k. The protest today blew the inauguration crowds out of the water; I was present both Friday and Saturday and there is absolutely no comparison.

On Friday (inauguration) you could be in downtown and not know anything was going on on the mall. Just one mile from the mall up 14th street (a major artery in DC) you couldn't tell anything was going on on the mall where the inauguration was being held. The protest that made national news occurred at 14th and K st. and if you were two blocks north you couldn't tell.

For the Women's March, however, every street in downtown from Massachusetts Ave. to the mall was crowded with protesters. I have never seen more people concentrated in one area in my life. If the inauguration drew 600,000 in the city, the Women's March brought at least 2 million. (I know 2 million isn't accurate; my point is that 600,000 for the inauguration is way overblown)"
"I'm not all that worried about how it compares to Obama (though that is funny), I'm worried that it's way off from what they SAID. They lied about that shit"
"It wasn't anywhere close to 600k for the inauguration. Today's estimates were at 500k, and anyone there both days can tell you that.  "

"Yeah, but how many were supporters & how many were protesters?"
Because Trump supporters were at work 
"Couldn't that be due to DC being a more dem state? I don't know anything about which states more dem or rep, but if DC was dem, that would explain the discrepancy."
"They're not allowed to release estimates.  A number of years ago, there was a march (I believe it was the million man march, but I could be wrong) that was estimated at a number that was angrily disputed by its organizers.  The end result is that official agencies no longer provide the numbers.

Unofficial agencies, however, have taken up the slack."
"buddy is in USSS and say the bureau is currently placing the number at ""Not exceeding 300,000"" but may refine that down as the data from the security checkpoints comes through and estimates of non-screened crowds becomes clearer (people who didnt go into the actual inaugural.

"
"I am in DC and spoke with someone from the DC police who said that according to their Ops center, the crowd for the protest (a little over 500k) was definitively larger than the inauguration crowd."
"Nope however we (in the DC area) use several factors. 

1) Metro ridership. Anyone with a brain would use metro. The numbers reflect the estimates. 

2) How often WTOP reports 395 as backed up. Friday they said it was smooth flowing the whole time. This morning they were on full ""really hard to get downtown"" mode even though it was a Saturday. 

3) We can see the same photos as everyone however having walked the Mall countless times it's really easy to gauge the size. We know the area between Constitution and Independence very well. When I leave Caps games I often will skip Gallery Place/Chinatown and hustle over to McPherson Sq (roughly where the violent protests were) "

atleast thats how i picture it in my head."
"The database was rest as was the banner picture it is not that hard to understand.

Do you think Twitter allowed the Trump team to make @POTUS after moving to @POTUS.  Of course not, Twitter maintain complete control of the account during the transition.  Trump was busy at getting inaugurated. Hate the guy for a legitimate reason, but this is absolutely out of his control. "

">I was out both days, and today we by far the bigger crowd.

No one was talking about the attendance numbers for the protests.  

Trump's inauguration is either the third or the fourth most attended inauguration in history.  Multiple sources back up what I have said.  The only disagreement seems to be with Bill Clinton's numbers.  Some say 800k went to his first inauguration while others say it was 250k.

">Trump pulling the 1.5M number out of his ass.

He was saying from his vantage point it looked like a crowd of 1.5 million.  It was a figure of speech,  he saying there was a large turnout,  he never said ""we know for a fact that 1.5 million people attended my inauguration""

His full quote was:

> “I'm like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people.”

Spicer might have been wrong when he said Trump's inauguration was the most attended inauguration in history,  but based on the number of people spouting misinformation (both in this thread and in media outlets) his decision to slam the media for their biased and dishonest reporting was the right call.

And apparently he has already been triggered over the fact that his crowds weren't over a million.  Spicer basically screamed at the media.  
"How do you know it was at least 800,000? Don't try to ask me a question about how I know the attendance when you know we both got our information from reports. This isn't the first thing he said. If it was just this, fine, a minor flub. All throughout it's been ridiculous and he just started. Mexico will pay for the wall! Jk, taxpayers will. Btw he doesn't pay his taxes. Oh and something about grabbing women without their consent. If any president made these statements, people would be all over them. Don't get butthurt over it happening to Trump. 

Edit: ""However, crowd size experts told the New York Times they estimated Trump's audience at fewer than 200,000 people, and widely distributed side-by-side photographs showed the stark contrast between the comparatively sparse crowd for Trump's inauguration and the record-setting crowd for Obama's first.""

And then the President bringing it up in a speech later that day for no reason, ""I was there and it looked like 40 points but they said it's 33 and showed pictures of the scoredboard at 33 and they said the Patriots did not score 40"".  

And your takeaway from this is that the LEFT is taking this crowd shit too seriously?  You need to get your head examined. Also, what Bernie Sanders has to do with anything is beyond me.

"See Obama was actually incompetent during his 8 years in office. As the first black president, he had a tremendous opportunity to bring this nation together, but he chose to side with these divisive social justice/domestic terrorist groups, and race relations are worse now than they were in the 1960s. Which is just part of why Trump is our president. 

Furthermore, he never backed up all the wonderful things he said during his campaigns. Hope and change? There's hopelessness and change for the worse at the end of his term, just look at Mrs. Obama's hometown of Chicago. And don't even get me started on how much of a failure Obamacare was.

Republicans like myself have hounded Obama because there is valid evidence that Obama was incompetent in office. Yeah, Trump said some things that pissed people off, but the way I see it, the hounding of Trump and his family is baseless. Democrats don't have the evidence that Republicans have against Obama.

i wouldnt compare him to stalin because stalin was a far left extremist. hitler was a far right extremist so it more appropriate to compare his rise to power to hitler if you had to pick between those 2.
They stopped believing one pile of bullshit and bought into an even bigger one.
"yea. people didnt take the time to think ""he has never had any political experience in his life nor has he ever been a 'common man'. how do i trust hes knows whats best for us?""

also people need to do research. both hilary and trump didnt start acting like sweet innocent angels who claimed they were passionate about serving the people until the campaigning started. people who dont put any research into their candidate and only impulse vote based on who has the best catchphrase and slogans shouldnt have the right to vote....in any country."

"It's funny that they think they're making a difference. There was non-stop bitching about Trump before the election, and (aside from a short stunned pause) there has been non-stop bitching afterwards. After a while it all becomes white noise."
"It's not even that they lied, the worrying part is that it seems so very very very important to him."
"Lied, and then called the media liars.  A vast media conspiracy to make him look unpopular."
"Oh I know, just clarifying for context. "
Isn't that scary when they already lie about such minor issues like the size of an inauguration crowd? That will make people question everything the White House says. Democracy is built on trust. 
"Oh, come now.  Trump is a business man, he's negotiating facts."
Yeah many arenas in southern states lie about attendance.   Not sure what Dallas is going for here

"You would be right, it was the million man march in 1995."
"Every number released in an assumption. They estimate based on certain sections and how full they appeared. You actually can't ""place"" the number anywhere outside of those areas. However they are claiming, by visuals, that it exceeded the most s republican candidate has received. Not like any of this really matters, it's all quite petty.

Sad!
At least he's not parroting collectivist popular opinions in order to gain acceptance from strangers on the internet.
how does it feel living in a country whose first language isnt english but speaks it better than the average american trump supporter?
"i mean stalin didnt have much of a personality. as a person as told by russian historians and his daughter svetlana, he didnt have much charisma. he was georgian who spoke russian as a second language and to ethnic russians he sounded like a person speaking threw google translate. but people cheered for him because they were afraid of what would happen if they didnt, plus he had legit supporters too. he was just some dude who ran a country that smoked a lot.

hitler tho did have a personality. as terrible of a person as he was, he spoke with emotion in his speeches and wasnt a monotone robot like stalin was."

"More of the quote:

>This was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe.

So...not that I can see."
So trimp and his team claiming it was the most attended inauguration was a lie? Who woulda thought...
Trump didn't pull 800k. Most estimates are around 250k.
Sean Spicer lied. on purpose lied. he didn't prevaricate. he said it was the largest audience to ever watch an inauguration which is a lie anyway you take it
"The women's march was said to have pulled 500k just in D.C. today, and D.C. police said that was about twice as many as were there the day before. Ridership on the Metro was also significantly lower on Friday than it was yesterday, and that's always a pretty reliable indicator to extrapolate turnout from.

Also, just look at the pictures. There's no way the 2017 crowd is even half the size of the 2009 crowd. It's a quarter, at the absolute most."
"I started randomly watching on Tuesday when I overshot NFL Network and ended up on NHL Network. I don't think I've changed the channel since and I'm *very* upset about last night's Stars game.

No neither did Trump. Apparently not having enough people as the first black President means every news outlet has to sneak diss you though.
Every group is composed of a silent majority with a more radical and vocal minority. That's like me judging all Trump supporters by the hate groups that endorsed him. 
"That's how it is all over the US. It's because the education level is so low in the rural counties. The downtown areas of cities are the same. The best representation of educated voters is in the suburbs outside of cities.

I mean besides just wanting to shit on whichever political side you're not aligned with, why do you feel this way?"
"Um... I'll bite. No, the tone of his comment was really immature and stupid. There are some intelligent people I really respect who DID vote for Trump. None of them are rich. While I don't agree with their choices, calling them gullible dumbshits is indicative of someone who's already made up their mind before opening it to a meaningful conversation, it's an unwillingness to learn from each other and move forward. Calling each other names because of a political preference only adds fuel to the fire we're all in together. It doesn't help. A similar mindset is why we have him in office now. Laugh and be an idiot about it, congratulations, you're part of the problem now.

I voted for Hilary because I didn't believe I had an option. Write-ins do nothing in my state. And, I am young, have a poor job, but I'm not on welfare. If I was older or successful, I still would have voted for her because while I don't love her, I definitely love a racist, misogynistic authoritarian even less."

Honestly, that's what I see most of my fellow liberals concerned about as well.  I'm sure it salts you to see people calling conservatives Nazis and lumping you in without actually taking the time to listen to your concerns, so don't do the same thing.

"You keep saying the silent majority voted for him but *facts*, which are still actually a thing say otherwise. Trump didn't win a majority of voters, period. Trump received less votes than Clinton, period. He isn't President because of the silent majority, he is President because of the Electoral College.

So either you don't know what the silent majority is or you are using ""Trump Facts™"" with no basis in reality. Yes, everyone knows he is President, there is no disputing that fact, but you can't possibly be mystified as to why he is unpopular. He only got 46% of the votes in the election; 54% of voters voted for someone else. Only 29% eligible voters cast a ballot for Trump. Trump's approval rating at inauguration is 37%; the lowest of any President ever and his disapproval rating is 54%. Compare that to Obama in 2008 where he had an 83% approval rating and a 12% disapproval rating at inauguration. If you voted for Trump you are in the minority. If you currently approve of Trump, you are really in the minority. In what world do those numbers constitute a majority silent or otherwise?"
"That isn't the point at hand. The original point you made is to cite a ""study"" where they use the registration status of those arrested to represent protestors as an entirety.

"I'm not gonna downvoted you or whatever but just know this skepticism is exactly what modern day propaganda is. No one is telling the truth is the narrative they try to spin so then a report by an investigative journalist is put on the same level as pizzagate or saying hillary us literally a demon. All those have the same legitimacy. 

Some guy explained it pretty well on reddit and was on r/bestof a couple weeks ago. Can't search it on mobile but recommend reading it. It kinda put a check on my skepticism a bit. 

I'm not saying trust every word they say but understand that modern day propoganda is trying to take us there and recognize this fact and don't fall prey to it. 

Also good to differentiate biased news from fake news. News and every word even YOU say has a bias. But bias doesn't always been false. It at best is just a different perspective. At worst, of course, propoganda. As long as humans with incomplete knowledge and emotions are involved there has always been and always will be bias but it doesn't mean it's illegitimate or just as legitimate as some inflammatory story seen on facebook. 

So realize there a healthy amount of skepticism and try to find that. You may never find it but the continuous attempt is necessary."

"I agree that we should be critical of the media, especially when things are falsely reported. I also think that we should be just as critical, if not moreso, of our leaders. 

Donald Trump said that the crowd ""went all the way back to the Washington monument""

We have photographs as well as video proof that this is not true. 

Donald Trump said that it was ""a million, a million and a half people"" which if estimates are correct at 750k, is just as far off as ""the media"" saying it was 250k

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said ""This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period — both in person and around the globe""

Again, we have photographic and video evidence that the physical audience at Obama's inauguration was larger. I cannot speak to the size of the online audience but I would not be surprised if Obama's was larger as well. 

So yes, we should certainly challenge the media to report fairly, but we should also challenge our leaders in the same way. When your leaders are presenting lies as truths and attempting to lead people to distrust other information sources...It's honestly a little frightening "

Just under 750k is the closer actual number.

"Yes, but neither you, your neighbour, Bush, Clinton or Obama is the president. Trump is. And so it is fairly irrelevant saying what others have done wrong when right now what matters is what he is doing wrong *right now*.

"People expected him to straighten up in the new year, with increased attention to him as crucial markers in the process to becoming president approached.

Oh sorry, that was last year before the primaries started. They also expected to straighten up after the primaries and in the final months of the election cycle. But he's shown himself so far to be incapable of it."

"I heard an interview with his former campaign manager who was asked about some of his ""promises"" such as the wall and if it would just be a review of the policies or increased policing. He was quite emphatic that Trump doesn't speak in metaphors and there was no doubt that DT meant every word he said. ""There will be a wall."" "
"I had expected some ""adults"" to be in place in the administration who would have clamped down on this shit (the CIA ""speech"" is even worse than the Spicer tirade of lies.)  Republicans have all three branches of government, and they got it, in part, because Trump was constrained/muzzled during the last 2 or so weeks of the campaign.  

I'm cynical as hell about Trump, but even this surprised me.  It's been obvious that continuing this way is going to result in Trump (and lots of Republicans) going down in flames."

>Yes, we're aware that the crowds were somewhat smaller than the crowds that attended President Obama's inaugurations. Most of the hundreds of thousands of our supporters who attended President Trump's inauguration yesterday don't live inside the Beltway. They aren't Washington insiders. They're hardworking people who took time away from their lives to drive hundreds or even thousands of miles to bear witness to the moment we all built together. So just because President Trump's supporters don't live in the Acela Corridor and just because many of our supporters (to whom we are so very grateful) have busy working lives does not mean that our crowd wasn't every bit as enthusiastic as other presidents' crowds."

"Indeed. Sean Spicer got up, had a 5 minute rant, where pretty much every single thing he claimed was not only a lie ([Vanity Fair had a good article](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/sean-spicer-inauguration-statement-lies) breaking down every single one of his claims), but easily refutable, then after telling reporters what they SHOULD be writing stories on, he left without taking any questions.

But the Bush administration's top ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, is out there explaining a bunch of Trump's very serous legal problems and how they are impeachable.  Also, I assumed that ""adults"" would muzzle Trump once he was actually sworn in.  Trump's flat-out batshit ""speech"" addressing the motherfucking CIA, plus this ""Baghdad Bob"" level bullshit tirade at the press, means that Trump is unconstrained.

This level of crazy is going to drag down the Republicans, and once their necks are on the line, impeachment/conviction is going to be a lot more appealing to them.

I think you might want to re-evaluate what you consider intelligent and worthy of respect.  You just finished calling the man a racist misogynist authoritarian, why do you respect and think people that voted for him are intelligent?

What are you even talking about? Moscow has been exerting it's power at will in Eastern Europe and Syria. Obama's removal of troops in Iraq in 2011 led to a power vacuum that opened the door for the Islamic State. Libya descended into extremist anarchy after the U.S. helped oust Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.

And what he said was ""I thought it looked like a million, a million and half"" and ""Here they're showing me an empty field when I was there, thought I saw a million and half, but whatever the real number was, the 250k they reported was wrong...""

Spicer, I believe said 'Republican inauguration'.

The photos also are taken at different distinguishing times. So they're not perfect representation to compare.

"Probably most importantly has been his willingness to support NATO allies by rotating important units through E. Europe to train and support NATO units there as well as ramping up BALTOPS, and other coordination and training programs (Rapid Trident for example). Both BALTOPS and Rapid Trident as well as other training operations in the Baltics send a strong example to Russia. Two B2's, against Russian wishes, have been forward deployed to the UK, putting strategic bombers on Russia's eastern doorstep is a pretty strong message. These sorts of cooperative measures are something I think will suffer under our new administration. President Obama has also been strong in regards to China where he authorized FONOPs and ramped up stuff like RIMPAC to enhance our ability to operate with our allies in the area as well as demonstrate our resolve to contest the S. China sea basing B2's in Guam, ramping up A2/AD abilities by moving F-22s in and out the region and working with Korea to forward deploy THADD launchers to the peninsula once again against Chinese and Russian wishes. 

President Obama has always been a pretty thoughtful and careful leader, large grandiose gestures are not his style but Great Power Competitions are won in the subtle moves not large ones. 

Withdrawal of troops from Iraq was promised by President Bush and the Iraqi government refused to allow them to stay longer then the agreed timeline, there was and is no support at home to invade Syria so I am not sure how we deal with that. Lybia was a cluster fuck but seeing as we tried to let Europe clean up its own mess with that one that's to be expected."
"> Obama's removal of troops in Iraq in 2011 led to a power vacuum that opened the door for the Islamic State.

Bush signed the order to withdraw troops from Iraq by that date. Obama tried to re-negotiate with the Iraqis but they wouldn't budge. They thought that it was time to make peace and rebuild.

Obama couldn't go back on Bush's agreement without hurting the integrity of America's foreign policy."

Geopolitics is a little bit complicated.  We are very dependent on their oil you can't just push them aside that easily.  Lets see if Trump continues business with them or not (he will.)

It's hard to make a change all the way overseas.  However, if your own president has been known to treat women like objects you might actually be able to make a difference or show your discontent.

"Him saying the media will ""pay big"" for this is not a threat?

What is it then?"
You could make the same type of defenses for media reporting. It doesn't change the inaccuracy of the information 
"First, it's possible to win a popular vote with a plurality. No majority is required, and I never claimed Hillary won a majority. 

Second, I voted Johnson - Weld, so your sore loser comment is pretty stupid since I knew going in my guys were never gonna win. 

Third, and most important, you are missing the point I was making. I'm guessing because, like the President, you are very insecure in his victory. (It's okay, if I won something with nearly 3 million people preferring the other option, I'd be insecure as well)

The point isn't about who won or who lost.  It's about the difference between a **reporting bias** and a **lie**.

It's a **reporting bias** to fail to mention that less than 10% of DC residents voted for Trump and over 90% voted for Obama when comparing inauguration sizes. It is an important fact that gives context to the story. 

It's a **lie** to claim the inauguration crowds were larger than they actually were. There is video evidence of their size. There is hours long video of the national mall from the entire day, and it never filled up the way the President is lying about."
"well they arent necessarily wrong.

hitler rose to power by scapegoating the jews. trump rose to power by scapegoating the muslims and mexicans. hitler abolished any bad media of him within his country. trump is saying the media will ""pay dearly"" (or whatever that quote said)."
"Yeah, and Trump never said that it was 1.5 million. He said from his view it looked like it.

""I thought there was a million, a million and half people out there""

Also, the media channel he called out never reported 750k, they reported 250k.

This is a very important detail. He was specifically calling out that 1 channel that lied."
"Yes I agree completely. But saying what Trump is doing doesn't matter and shouldn't be acted upon because Obama or whoever the fuck they are blaming did the same thing years ago is completely stupid and that mentality needs to change if you want a functioning democracy. 

That was mainly my point, not that people shouldn't be held accountable for things just because it's in the past."

They are either live or they are not. CNN can't review something and show it live at the same time
"CNN is anti American propaganda.

"That really is a false equivalence, which ironically was one of the main tactics of Trumps campaign. RT is on another level for propaganda."
"No it is not. As bad as DW and CNN can be, RT is on a different level"
"That is a horrible idea.

If one person tells you the world is flat, and the other person tells you the world is round, it doesn't mean the truth lies in the middle, it means that you shouldn't listen to the first person.

"Yes, everyone has that power. That isn't fascism.

Anyway, Canada's former Prime Minister tried that. It worked against him. I can't see it helping Trump. The Media/politician relationship is symbiotic, the politician relies on the media to get their message out, in return the media gets to ask questions.

At any rate, it isn't fascism or anything close to it. That's retarded."

One party wants to be like Europe. One party wants to be like Russia. Americans aren't as familiar with Europe and their flaws like they are with Russia. From my point of view both groups want to destroy the country. The only saving grace about conservatives for me is that they tend to have internal bickering and criticism. It sets a good precedent of distrust in the establishment. Democrats have started to lock step with one another after being in power for so long and they need to stop that if they want to regain their influence on the country. Of course I live in an isolated liberal city so my perception on democrats could be slanted toward the extreme.

You're right, you didn't call me a racist, I can't expect an answer from you on that. That was really for those in this thread who have called me a racist. I don't consider myself a victim, however. I find it incredibly hypocritical and major reason why Trump gained so much support in this first place. The left insulted their way out of a win. 

This March isn't going to make a change here, there really isn't anything to change IMO. They obviously believe they live in this nation that is so hell bent on oppressing women that they literally can't succeed - this is why I consider most of them (not all) victims of a mental illness. 

When I say they aren't protesting the crimes of other nations that are actually oppressing women - killing them in fact, it's because they aren't but not just they aren't protesting them but that they actually support them. How? They support those who actively support them. Why wasn't there a stop at a Saudi Embassy? Why are protest signs showing women in head dress (that was protested heavily in Arabic nations when it was mandated women wear them)? Why aren't these major issues for these women protesting here? 

We've always been a nation to protest and call out the crimes of other nations against their people, but why not on this issue? 

My point (this is turning into a ramble) is that they are completely misguided. You can probably thank Georgie for that. It may also be because their protest of that issue, against those nations and our dealing with them, would be protesting against the very people they support whom they believed would be ""their voice"". 

The march does have an organizer. It was one march that was called for many different cities around the nation. It was sponsored by many organizations (most have ties to a Soros) and the leader is Linda Sarsour - she is one of many, I will add. She's been accused of receiving funding from Hamas and openly supports implementing Sharia Law, which we all should know is incredibly dangerous for women. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but yes, I do believe trump will dial back our support and dealing with these nations. I do believe we will see a major shift in our alliances, which I support. We are bleeding the stone and it has to stop.

"You're wrong, he did not say ""pay big"" 

Listen to his speech. By no means is it a threat. It is him saying the media network should be held accountable for reporting falsified information. Which it should be.

And he doesn't say ""we're gonna make em 'pay big'"" 

No, he says ""I think they're gonna pay A big price""

"Saying 'Verified crowd of 250k at inauguration"" and ""I thought I saw a million, a million and a half people, they stretch way back"" are 2 VERY VERY different statements.

One is from a news source that should be held accountable, as Trump says, for publishing falsified information.

They other was that he said he thought he could see that many people. And then later saying ""Thought it was a million and a half, but whatever the real number is, they lied, caught em in a beauty...""

No where does he go and say he had record breaking numbers confirmed."
"But, she didnt win the popular vote. She won the popular vote in Cali and have those votes been verified? California is but, one state and certainly not representative of the entire country Additionaly, before HRC lost no one mentioned the popular vote. Now it's all about the popular vote.

"So you're telling me that the democracies in NZ and Australia (for example, just because I am familiar with them) aren't designed to stop a fascist dictator? You said America was the only country that is so that's exactly what you're saying. Which is patently wrong.

The point about America having the most systems in place is also wrong. There are multiple checks and balances in every democracy. The MMP electoral system in NZ makes it very difficult for one party to hold too much power, let alone one fascist dictator. 

Australia also has multiple states. America is not the be all and end all of democracies, in fact id go as far to say it's one of the worst there is in the first world, just look at the outcome of the latest election, not to mention the jerrymandering and corruption (eg unlimited spending on election campaigns, high powered ""lobby groups"" etc).

"It really depends. The Bears and Packers have a deep seated rivalry as do the Vikings and Packers. 

Which rivalry is more important is a matter of geography; in western Wisconsin, the Vikings/Packers rivalry is more likely to be a bigger deal to Packers fans whereas in eastern Wisconsin it is more likely to be Bears/Packers. 

Western Wisconsin is a suburb of three Minnesota cities/MSAs:  Minneapolis/St. Paul, Duluth, and Rochester. South Eastern Wisconsin is a suburb of Chicago and counted as part of Chicago's MSA. As such, you get a lot of Wisconsinites working and ""living"" (but not residing) in Minnesota and Illinois. Both states get a lot of refugees from Wisconsin in general as the Twin Cities and Chicago are the huge business hubs for the region and there are a lot more employment opportunities. That leads to a lot of Cheeseheads living in enemy territory.

Bears and Viking's fans hate the Packers. Packers fans hate the Bears and Vikings but who they say is their #1 rival will depend on where they live. Bears and Vikings fans generally bond over their hatred of the Packers unless they are playing each other that week. Bears, Packers, and Vikings fans generally forget that the Lions exist and Lions fans are too busy memeing, being excited their team is just doing well, or being depressed when they ultimately go back to doing ""Just Lions' Things"" to care about rivalries."

"> I find it incredibly hypocritical and major reason why Trump gained so much support in this first place. The left insulted their way out of a win.

I agree that there is a lot of people wrongly saying Trump supporters are racist.  I do not attribute this to one of the main reasons why he won but that is a minor disagreement I don't care about too much.  I do think Trump himself has done some racist things.  Like that judge he said could not judge his case because his parents were Mexican (I do not remember the judges name right now.)  Saying he couldn't be fair because of his race was a bit racist.  And I thought he thought (legal) Latinos actually like him for being strong on illegal immigration?  However, to go and say Trump is KKK level racist is dumb, and to say Trump supporters are all racist, also dumb.

> This March isn't going to make a change here, there really isn't anything to change IMO. They obviously believe they live in this nation that is so hell bent on oppressing women that they literally can't succeed - this is why I consider most of them (not all) victims of a mental illness.

I think this march was more about the president himself.  That the message it sends that someone who says awful things about women can become president.  Most of them don't think they live in a world where they cannot succeed.  However, most do think that there is some stumbling blocks in the way.  Some probably Identify with feminism too much and have some kind of mental illness.  But, while you say most have this mental illness, I say most do not.

"First of all, I'd love to see your source for the quote ""verified crowd of 250k"" since anything I've seen about that number looks like:

>[The Joint Congressional Committee for Inaugural Ceremonies distributed about 250,000 tickets for Trump's inauguration, per spokeswoman Laura Condeluci, including 1,600 on the platform and another 1,000 on the bleachers above. That number is on par with the distributed tickets for previous ceremonies.

Secondly, you're literally saying ""it's okay for the White House to provide false information for XYZ reason but it's not okay for the media to provide false information for ABC reason."" The data provided by the White House Press Secretary has proven to be false, including direct numbers claimed to be confirmed, as you say the media has done. Here's a quote from Sean Spicer again, the white house press secretary:

>""We know that 420,000 people used D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama's last inaugural""

And in contrast, here's what the metro service themselves have to say about it:

>""Metro said 570,557 people took trips in the system between its early 4 a .m. Friday opening through midnight closing.
The figures are significantly lower than those from the 2009 and 2013 Inaugurations of President Barack Obama; 1.1 million trips in 2009 and 782,000 in 2013, according to Metro.""

You're so easily willing to give up listening to reason because reason and the truth puts him in a good light, and you just can't stand that.

I'm not completely stoked about Trump, but he's a businessman and experienced around money. And a hell of a lot better choice than Hillary 'under FBI investigation for tampering with government documents' Clinton.

I'd have voted for Bernie if I'd been given that option. The ones you need to blame are the ones who allowed Clinton to rig the Democrat primaries in states that Bernie had actually won, but the results were tampered with in favor of Clinton. It is democrats faults for Trump's election. Not mine."

Yes because Hillary's followers made up a story about Trump running a child sex trafficking ring out of a pizza place. Oh wait...
"I wasn't really implying anything like that... 

I meant Trump more as an extension of the republicans. Yeah sure no fascist legislation has yet been put forth, but blah blah my other points"
"Based on your two comments ITT, it appears there's a whole lot you don't know about Trump and/or the US government.

Obama abused the hell out of executive orders in his 8 years, and Trump's already working on being even worse in less time."
"Don't be silly, the Devil has standards. "
"The very video you posted demonstrates how Trump was specifically mocking Kovaleski.  Yes, Trump does that ""spazzing out"" thing regularly, but his standard ""performance"" has his hands dangling loosely and held low (below his nipples (yuck).)  Two things come together to clarify Trump's intent to mock the reporter.  First, Trump provides his own context for the gesture by saying ""Poor guy"" and ""You should **see** this guy.."" [emphasis mine].  Trump lied and claimed he didn't now who Kovaleski was, despite having talked face-to-face with him more than a dozen times including a sit-down interview in Trump's offices and addressing Kovaleski by name during that time.  Second was the gesture itself.  Rather than Trump's standard ""flappy, spazzy hands low and loose"", Trump immediately jacks his right arm up so his wrist is near his shoulder, and jacks his right hand down exactly like Kovaleski's distinctive hand.  There is no confusion here.  Trump specifically mocked Kovaleski's disability.

Let's also bring up the context.  When Trump mocked Kovaleski, it was part of Trump lying claiming that Kovaleski was unsure in his reporting or that he had changed his story.  Both statements by Trump were lies.

And what was the story.  It was Kovaleski reporting on the reality that there were no Muslims out ""celebrating"" on 9/11/2001 in the parts of New Jersey directly across from NYC.  Trump has repeatedly claimed that he personally saw, in his words, ""thousands"" out celebrating the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.  Trump has repeatedly claimed that he saw these celebrations with his own eyes when he was in New Jersey that day.  No one has been able to find evidence of even a single public celebration in the area.

Mocking Kovaleski was horrible, lying about Kovaleski's reporting is awful, but repeatedly claiming something that is wildly, completely untrue, and claiming that he himself saw something that didn't exist is truly troubling."
You think it's debunked because he has mocked other people by pretending they are disabled?
We all need to have dreams. 
Aww sad to see you go 
"Lucy's not the boss of me!

"hahahaha that ""proof"" is already being debunked in that thread. the clock wasn't working. try again."
I was clearly making fun of the way you said having a family somehow keeps you from being able to tell whether Donald Trump is lying or not. 
"Just because they feed into your opinions does not make them less full of shit. In that study they were consistently found to misinform their views more than any other cable network. That's a fact. You cannot dispute it.

Also, having more viewers doesn't mean anything. Saying that as if it supports your point is...pointless."
"I'm not supporting him on that. I think he's full of shit a lot of the time. Though I think he's full of shit less than modern media and most politicians.

I'm only defending him in this instance because the information being passed around are his words twisted, stretched and altered so that it makes it sound like he's doing something awful.

> Threatening

I mean really, the guy was implying that a news station that casts nationally should be held accountable for the fact they advertised falsified information as though it were facts."
"I'm quoting Trump in his speech. That's my source. I'm not saying he has sources or truth. I'm saying that people saying he threatened the media in that speech are twisting his words from that speech to mean something else.

He said something

people are pretending he said something slightly different

I'm saying no, he said the original thing, the slightly different thing is just slander to make him look bad.

My source is literally just the speech. If you watch it, you'll see what I'm saying. He didn't say anything threatening, he didn't say 1.5 million confirmed people showed up, he said it looked like it was that many from his view."
"uh, no? there are two post of the clock working during the march. Nice try, bud. "
"Oh. Clearly.

The point is when most dudes have to worry about a wife and kids and supporting them and the mortgage and the car payment and their college fund you don't really have much time to research any of the BS CNN spews out."
Rhey don't feed into my opinion they just state more facts and do less bullshit. Except in the morning. Lol
"If you're gonna quote something, at least use the real quote

>And I turn on the thing and by mistake I get this network - and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people.

There's nothing about ""confirmed numbers"" (from trump or ""the media"") so if anyone here is twisting words it's you. 

Now I will agree with you that him saying ""it looked like a million people"" is not the same as him saying ""we've got numbers to show it was at least a million"" but I have not seen anything in the media that claims any exact numbers except that 250k tickets were given out, which is a number given directly from the administration. 

The more problematic piece is not Trumps speech though, it's the press secretary claiming false numbers and providing false information. Trump himself did not speak with that level of conviction as you are saying but he certainly is the one who ordered the press conference and the press conference *was* making incorrect claims as if they were facts, and that's the real problem here. So my point is that the trump administration is pushing false information as fact, even if that information isn't coming directly from Trump's own mouth. "

"Except they do not do that. They provide more bullshit, stretch the truth and misinform their viewers at a higher rate than any other cable news network. I'm not sure what you're not getting about that."
You're wrong but believe what you want :)
"I mean, I'm the only one who provided any evidence to support my argument. So how am I wrong?"
Glad they didn’t get him in contact with Tim Peel. I’ve never heard of Chmielewski which means he’s probably a really good ref.
Nice that he gave a kid a whistle. Let's see if dad is still so thrilled with this package a few hours from now.
"Parenting tips to help your son along his way to becoming an NHL referee:

* When scolding your son for not doing his chores, follow it up with a rude remark about his eyesight. ""You still haven't cleaned your room. What are you blind?""

* When your son is doing his chores right, encourage him with a barrage of boos. Get your wife and other kids in on this too. When he gets older, throw in some ""ass-hole"" or ""bull-shit"" chants.

* Give him the task of breaking up fights between siblings or at family get-togethers. When other kids are fighting, have your son clear the area of surrounding toys and other tripping hazards. Have him stand and watch them fight until they get tired. That's his cue to get in between them and then escort them to time-out. ""Five minutes each for FIGHTING!""

* Have a Dennis Wideman jersey. Your son knows he's in big trouble when you put it on."
"As much as we shit on the refs, this was pretty cool :)"
"Avs, Oilers and Caps bias confirmed."
I am so sorry your child is blind and it's great there are so many opportunities out there for employment for him. I wish him well !
"I don't think refs get enough credit. They skate for the whole 60+ minutes while dodging players wearing full gear while trying to watch everything on the ice. Fuck Tim Peel though, that guy sucks. "
"You must have one smart kid if his first instinct is to be like one of the boys in stripes rather then be like a player. I've always said you have to *really* love the game to want to be a reff, those guys get all the abuse in the world. "
RemindMe! 20 years
"The NHL is a pretty class act organization all around. 

I don't know why you're kid idolizes those guys but the game can't survive without them so make sure he gets out there and makes some calls in a few years! "
Nice of them to give you the alternative rule book in English and not the main one in braille. 
"One of the main things referees are *supposed* to do are be positive representations of the game. NHL referees have a little bit of flare due to the large scale production they are a part of, and the fact that a few are utter shit really brings their reputation down as a whole. That being said, I love seeing stuff like this, referees are good guys, they weren't always in the NHL, they worked their way up as the front lines of safe and fair play. They love the sport as much as anyone who is playing, and the last thing they want to be is the bad guy, but that's just part of the job. I guarantee you that your son's letter meant just as much to the ref he contacted. It really is the best game on earth!"
Atta boy Stripes. Fuckin beauty move there bud. 
"Damn, thats a sharp hat!"
Wholesome as fuck.
[Picture of when OP's son and Tom met](https://i.imgur.com/ttDYFGd_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)
I think the ref was just super giddy that someone actually reached out to the refs and not the players. 
Wow Good Guy Tom
"Hockey folks are the greatest. 
Love it!"
"That's sweet.

We love to hate on the refs, but you make 100k plus and get to travel the world while being part of the greatest sport.

Hope your kid fulfills his dream."
That’s so awesome! I bet your son was absolutely stoked. Hope he gets to fulfill his dream.
That's really great of him to do for your son. I hope he stays with it! 
That was such a cool thing to do. That kid has a awesome story for the rest of his life.
oh thats awesome! hopefully he won't be bombarded with emails from people just trying to get some free stuff now though
That is so cool! 
This is why hockey is the greatest game on Earth.
Some nice ass fuckin whistles there

"I have a friend and for a long time NFL ref was his goal, we all thought, nice to have dreams. He made it and is one currently. Worked his way up from Jr. Leagues, H.S., College then pro. He put the work in and never lost focus."
"I love it when people aspire to be support staff. Too often society expects us to aim to be superstars, so many who end up in support are people have failed at their primary goal. These people are more likely to half-ass their jobs than someone who has aimed to be support in the first place.

All this to say, thank you Mercy mains. Fuck you, Moira."
I love hockey and its community. 
"what a good guy Tom Chmielewski is. something your son is always going to remember
 "
Your son's got some great aspirations. This is why I love hockey.
You won’t see the nfl do this... love it!!
What were his responses and advice from the email? 
how DARE you humanize the refs!
"That's sick! The vast majority of hockey players, and refs, seem like genuinely good people - always humble and kind :) it's so nice to see. Absolutely the greatest game on earth. "

"I’m sorry in advanced, for what I might say to your child in the future. "
R/hawwkey calling 😊
Holy shit even referee names are hard to pronounce 
God this warms my cold dead heart. This is awesome.
This is amazing. Bravo to your son and this ref for cultivating his dreams! 
"I hardly know anything about hockey besides the fact that my roommate gets incredibly enraged with the Buffalo Sabres, but this is really amazing! Made me smile."
"When I was growing up in Spokane , there may have been players who had dreams of being in the NHL; I was in a tier one camp for 2 weeks (the highlight of my athletic career, but did not know it at the time) but we had a guy who reffed a lot of games.  Just all the time.  Showed up everywhere and was kind of an officious guy who reffed every game and ran a tight ship at 16 with adults yelling at him.  

He ended up reffing in the Olympics, and in the NHL for a very long time.  From my whole generation he was the guy who made it.  All the way to the NHL and beyond-- As a ref. More than pretty cool, a real feel good story.  

Totally straight up guy.  Here is his retirement story:

"
ITT: Blind jokes
"As a USA Hockey official, I am totally jealous of a 3rd grader right now :P

Tell your son to skate hard, learn to skate backward really well and sign up for USA Hockey ASAP!"
"Two jobs in America that I feel have major shortages in, one being those entering the priesthood and the other being an NHL referee.  Both take equally major sacrifices. I wish your son the best! ;)"
I bet this made Chmielewski's week. I can't imagine refs feel like they're inspirations for young fans very often.
Your son wants to be blind and deaf?
"aww, what a nice gesture. I bet it made his day."
"Hell yeah! Lots to learn, but great to start young!"
Chewy is the best ref as far as nice guys go. I used to work as an equipment guy in the AHL and when he could he would take us out to dinner or drinks after most games.
Apparently the bribery and corruption of NHL judges starts early.
"So they don't actually read the rule books, they just give them away. This explains a lot.
Seriously though, that's pretty cool. "
"Came here from r/all. Reminded me of when I wanted to be a referee for football (soccer) and my dad sent off a letter to the FA. They sent me a package of goodies too. It made my 7 year old self's week!

I never did become a referee. Here's hoping your son has better staying power than me."
Classy as fuck
"Okay, this is legit the best thing I've ever read on reddit. 

and it also made the front page!"
"I think Canada has youth program for hockey referee.  

 I just remember customer telling me his son who I think was 15 or 16 was something like that. 

This was in Saskatchewan if that matters. I don't if any Canadians correct me if I am wrong. "
I don't usually comment in this sub but wanted to add how awesome it is that they really encouraged your sons' inquiry. I love when people go out of their way to support kiddos! 
Went to high school with Tom Chmielewski. Great dude.
It’s things like this that restore my faith in humanity. 
"I've played beer league for years, the refs are my favorite guys. We give them shit when they miss things, but our best ally out there is a good ref who helps keep the game clean."
"He might change his career choice 20 times, but this is something he'll never forget.  "
"My favorite part about this is that it seems like everything he included here actually belonged to him. Not something the NHL or ref's association did, just him on his own."
I look forward to yelling at your son one day :)
So I guess the rule book is just a blank spiral notebook?
"Reffing in anybsport has to be brutal, props to em all"
Plus points for the use of ‘an’ before ‘NHL Referee’. 
"This is really cool. I wanted to do it too since a young age. Had a friend I talked to about it who tried, not sure where you are but don koharski does a clinic right outside Toronto. From there they have guys from different leagues scouting and will pick some refs out. Apparently it's really gruelling putting 20 000 miles on your own car getting paid 100 a game although they give you food and can stay in the player housing. From those leagues the ECHL might pick you up then the NHL. It's a long hard road and takes commitment but for now hopefully your son can just have fun learning the rule book and officiating the game. So cool of him to write and receive this package. Goodluck on his journey. "
Probably already a better ref than Tim Peel.
"u/Jowilant

I'm in my 2nd year as an official and I will say this, it's a VERY tight knit group that cares for the most part about future generations coming up.  

Truth be told, your son has a significantly better chance of making the NHL or professional hockey as a Zebra than as a player.  He also can make a decent living doing Junior, college and minor pro games.  It's hard work but good honest work.  

When he gets to be 13 or so, get him to an officials seminar to learn the trade and cut his teeth in Mites and Squirt games.  It's also a great way for a young kid to make his own money.  If you're in the USA it's a pretty straight forward deal to get him going.  "
"Might be too late for this, but this is awesome! Tom is actually my close friends cousin! I'll for sure forward this on to her and make sure he knows his kindness is appreciated! "
The whistles are especially cool. That's awesome!
"My roommate in college had his eyes set on being a ref in the NHL; consummate professional, nicest guy you could hope to know, knows the rules of the game back and forth, even every change in the last 20 years, and as fast as anything can move on skates. Unfortunately, he is only 5'6 - on skates - and he was routinely harassed and disparaged by his colleagues, often getting the shit-end of the stick from the scheduling office.

After reffing his first and only OHL game he came back to our place in tears because his boss told him ""that's as close as you'll ever be to the NHL."" 

I hope for so much better for your son."
I was expecting a walking stick and a dark pair of shades
It's weird when we get to the top of reddit. You can feel all the eyes looking in on our little club.
where do you find nhl logo apparel like this? Tried the nhl store and it was just team stuff.
"I’m a youth/high school ref, almost 30 and still want to be a pro :("
That's awesome. Good on that dude for giving your son something he'll never forget.
I would just google the answers for my kid but then he wouldn't get any cool swag.
Are those game blown whistles?
Damn your son has a thing for law and order?
Ref you don’t suck at the moment 
"RIP your ear drums as your kid runs around the house blowing those whistles.

"
the good ol’ hockey game. 
"Wish I had made that decision as early as your son did. My Uncle ref'd Iginla when he was in his WHL days and as soon as I had heard that I wanted to be a ref, but felt like it was too late so I never pursued.

Good luck to your son! Hope to yell at my TV screen about a call he makes one day "
"This is awesome! My buddy and I got our hands on an NHL magazine when we were around nine and ten years old. We sent an email to the ""customer support"" team about how we wanted to start a 3 v 3 street hockey league with kids on our street. 

They ended up sending a cordial e-mail to our parents about where they could send a bunch of off-color jerseys. I'll ask my parents what catelog it was exactly if anyone is interested."
I wonder if Tom used those whistles. 
"This is awesome. I used to write to NHL teams as a kid and they'd send back posters or team photos. Still have a ton from the early 90s Devils teams, a few from the Nordiques (yup), and a massive poster of Jagr from the Pens. "
"So i'm honestly curious, do schools for the blind follow the 1-12 grading system or are they on their own curriculem? 

Either way I'm glad your son has stumbled across a calling in life despite his disability."
"Blow the whistle 

Blow the whistle

Blow the whistle"
Scumbag referee gives kid copy of last year's rule book ;)
Very relieved to see he wrote to the correct Tom Chmielewski. Likely would've received a very different type of package otherwise: http://www.krdo.com/news/archive/update-man-arrested-following-butane-hash-oil-explosion/35538918
Oh my gosh I know him! Well sort of. He's worked his way up through the ranks. We used to have an ECHL team here and he would ref here a lot. My husband was head of off ice officials for the team and would meet with all the refs before game and talked to him a lot. Saw him at a game in Nashville after he made the big time. 
"This is gonna get buried to hell, but this is the first time I have ever heard my last name outside of my immediate family. Really threw me off-guard. Don’t think I’m related to Tom, either."
I use to write the ducks letters (it was my favorite movie) and they would send me stickers and posters and shit. it was neat. 
No Sharks puck? 🙄😂😂
Class act.  
It's amazing that your son's blindness doesn't keep him from dreaming big.
"That is so freaking cool. I'm super peanut butter and jealous right now.
"
Awesome hat 
This is great. So proud of the sport!
Mah heart! 
Sorry to hear that your son is blind and deaf
"When he grows up he wants to lose his eye sight?

All jokes aside this is pretty sweet"
"So, is it true that when you hold those whistles that you want to do nice things for Sidney Crosby? ;-)"
Anyone know if you can purchase the hat and or rule book and where?
This is kickass. Good on the NHLOA.
"So is this proof refs are biased towards the Caps, Oilers and Avs?"
"I'm a 27 year old female, but I'm tiny with short hair. Went to a panthers playoff game and some guy in a suit gave me an official playoff puck. Pretty sure he thought I was a 12 year old boy. Regardless, I was pretty happy about. 
Super happy for your son. I'm sure he's ecstatic about this package. Hockey really is the greatest game."
That's amazing! God bless you and your son!
"I hope your son can read Braille! Lol, kidding.  This is awesome"
Tom chmielewski ....chance was spot on
"GOOD GUY GREG, REFERREE!  So nice of him to send him some game pucks probably from his home collection!  What a nice guy!  Also your son seems like an awesome dude!"
"That's pretty cool, but is there a note in the rule book?  Did he write notes in the book for your kid?  Because that is some dedication!"
"I can't imagine what it must be like for you. The difficulties must be overwhelming at times. You are an amazing parent, providing an amazing experience for your poor child. Thank god for you and your strength of heart. And thank god for the NHL, giving blind children everywhere a hope for future employment, just like they've done for yours."
Good call!
That is very cool 
That is pretty fucking awesome!
"I used to regularly go to minor league hockey games and sit at the glass. While my friends wore their jerseys, I wore my ref shirt I got for Halloween one year. The refs always loved it and usually threw a puck over the glass at me after the game. "
Best of luck in your future. Aye.
"This made me tear up, good luck Ben and a tip of the hat to the old man"
Good guy that Tom.
Pure class. Pure class. Loving these types of posts lately.
"I honestly would like to know what happens after stories like this come out.

Does the NHL Ref association get 1000's of letters from ""3rd graders"" all expecting a cool package of stuff over the next month or so? Do they send them?

It's like when a company does something nice for someone who has a disability or something and it goes viral, does that company get inundated for months with similar requests?  I bet they do. Do they respond or ignore?

I'd love to know if anyone has any experience."
"This is so cute I'm gonna' shed a tear. Go for it, kid :')"
What a guy. I hope that karma rewards this fella.
"At first i read it a NFL, and was like cool i guess then i read ""Greatest game on Earth"" i was like  they must have meant NHL. Was not disappointed when the photo opened"
"Looks like his personal handbook too, what a guy."
What a guy. This is the kind of thing that your son will remember for a long time even if he doesn’t become a ref. 
"Those ref whistles are $30+ a piece, kid lucked out, great guy!"
"OP, serious response here. If he's not playing yet, he needs to start. Like **everything** in hockey, skating is the most important component for refs. If he is playing, great! Make sure he keeps playing, having fun, and getting better.

If you're an American, he can become a ref at any age, but typically won't be able to really start until he's playing 14U or 16U (local child labor laws apply, and age reqs vary by local ref association). Though, in regions and orgs where 8U is refed, the younger kids can absolutely ref those games. Reach out to your local organization for info on that."
The real question here is why the fuck does your son want to be a ref? Get a stick in his hands while he's still young!
Was your son born blind or did something happen?
If my kid is ever in stripes he better be a bank robber. 
Not a hockey guy. Dont have the temperature where I'm from...... But this is just awesome
Love this
This is so cool. Hope your kid makes it as an NHL ref. :)
"Hopefully you guys are Canadian, otherwise its gonna be an uphill battle to become an NHL ref.  There was an in-depth article I read a few years ago that detailed the discriminations that non-Canadians had when refereeing both AHL and NHL games. "
"I reffed youth soccer when I was a teenager, it was really a great experience. I learned more about the game, but also how to deal with people, especially parents that were a little too serious. Good $ and good experience, i would definitely advise kids to get into Reffing/umpiring. "
That is awesome. 
Sweet. Those are good whistles.
Umm. I want to be a ref now too... can I have stuff?
"Ah to know what I wanted to do in third grade, must be nice. Kid is gonna be a natural. "
There definitely needs to be a pair of spectacles included 
That is awesome. Hope your son enjoys the sport and reffing. Its a challenge but an exciting way to view the sport and stay involved. Good luck!
"Sweet, good things still happen. Not with my team, but hey. I love hockey."
I used to deal with NHLOA members on a regular basis in my job and they were some of the easiest customers I had.
"When I wrote to Jamba Juice when I was in the 3rd grade, all they gave me was a foam lemon. Super jealous."
NHL refs seem like they have the most fun of the major sports refs.
Chiemo is a good dude. Glad to see him make it after all the work he's put in. Hopefully by the time the kid grows up they have moved past the only wanting former players concept they have now.  
"Dang, that is a sweet gift."
Cool I'll have to try this some time 
awesome
Man I love this sport. Nothing gets better than some good old Hockey!
Man the coolest part about this is those whistles.  Those look awesome.
Hope he does well! Honestly ive reffed for a few years in my teens and i had a lot of fun. Hope he becomes the best ref and screw over the leafs to let the habs win the cup :)

Refs really don't get the recognition they deserve. 
 I always feel bad for refs.  tons of them get booed a lot for any call not benefitting a specific team.
Go Knights go!
"I've never played hockey, but had friends that were die hard fans of the Kings, so I'd tag along to games all the time. Such a fan-friendly organization, even to tourists like me who are just along for the fun!"
I fuckn love this game. 
Freakin sweet!
Get him into reffing if he wants to. It's a great college job and can give you some great networking opportunities 
Yeah the game of hockey really can change a persons life. Awesome to see an NHL ref do something like this(maybe he needed good publicity after making a bad call XD)
"The NHL from top to bottom, is just so good to the children, I love it."
"So cool, so happy to see people reach out and excite a child to follow their dream!!!"
This is good encouragement!
"u/jowilant - I am pretty close with Shane Heyer and Mike Leggo
If you want to PM me I can see if they can get in contact with you"
This is probably the only time I'll cheer for a ref.
Well this... this gives me hope for the future after all...
"This is awesome! Hope to see your son in the league one day! I will say as a former ref, invest in some BMX/FMX leg pads, some refs are insane not wearing pads"
👍
Class act! 
That NHL hat... What I wouldn't give to own one of those.
They gave him last year's rule book :|
Chm....Those three letters aren't supposed to be together.
"Role models. Every child needs them. To those role models, thank you all."
"Haha, I'm sort of surprised they didn't send a jersey.  They should've gotten him in contact with Wes Mccauley cuz they need more showboat refs! 

Pretty awesome they got back to him, they can never staff enough refs, but it's nice to see the refs aren't such big shots that they're too busy to write back."
This is awesome. My husband was a hockey player for 10 years & would get a kick out of this. Good to see the NHL refs acknowledging the kids who look up to them.
What teams are on the hockey pucks?
Curious... Does the different logos of the teams on the puck distract the players when they see it?
"Booooo!

/s"
"I’m blind, I’m deaf, I wanna be a ref! Still my favorite hockey chant. "
It is a fantastic sport. Hope your son realizes his dream. I got to meet Gordie and Mark Howe when I was a kid. Both were really great and it is one of the best moments of my life.

Awesome! Gotta love Hockey!!
That's awesome! Side note: You may want to have a professional exam your son. Choosing to be a ref is as masochistic as it gets. 
He's got everything he needs to be a generic undrafted player profile picture in an EA NHL game!

So much respect for NHL and NHL referees. Those guys take beatings unlike any other referee in any other sport. And they don't complain. 
That's fantastic! Good on your son for going out there to connect with those who are working his dream job. Now he has things that will remind him for years to come. Hopefully it helps him achieve his goal!

"Hahahahaha, Avs bias, you're adorable.

The only team more hated by the refs than the Avs are the Flames. Thanks, Wideman!"
Oilers bias has been known for a loooong time!
Oooo!  1 bias please!
"I may be out of the loop on this one, but could you explain why the Avs on there?"
So nice of him to include 2 AHL pucks along with the Caps' one. 
I was honestly surprised the rule book isn't in Braille.
This went way over my head until I read the Braille comment... nice work
😂
/r/MurderedByWords 
Shoutout Wes McCauley though 
As a Sabres fan sometimes I’ve gone to games and just watched the sheer athleticism in the refs. 
"They give out pucks during games too!

Last month I was sitting right behind the photographer near the goal line, and mid-way through the game while the players were getting ready for a face-off in the corner the ref skated over and handed the photographer a puck through the opening. He was very nonchalant about it too, didn't even say a word, which made me think this happens regularly and might even be customary. The photographer took the puck, turned around, and threw it to a kid a few rows back.

I was totally in awe, you see players throwing pucks to fans all the time but I never realized that refs could too."
"My dad used to ref beer league on the base, and then kids games when he retired and we moved, and it kept him in ridiculous good shape considering his lifestyle was otherwise pretty sedentary. He had to stop though when some asshole broke his ribs. They don't heal so well in your fifties."
"I reffed a beer league game once, I'm sure you'd get used to it but it's really weird to skate up ice as fast as you can with the goal being to not be in the play at all. Like you can hug the far boards but even then you need a backup plan in case the puck gets rimmed around hard. "
Not to mention they travel solo for 8 months of the year. 90 games a year. If you're lucky part way through the season you get 2-3 games in a row somewhere warm and you can bring your family with you on vacation.
TJ Luxmore. I cringe when I see that name.
"I agree. I ref a beginner adult league, I fucking hate it. The guys that do it for the love of the game have my respect to no end. 

I got thrown into it, most of the refs I know got into it on purpose."
"It's often said that refs are blind, but the best thing to be as a ref is deaf. You'll never hear an unkind word. "
"This comment prompted me to look up a ref's salary.

>AskMen, while asking if a career in sports officiating is for you, also reported that “no other officials in any of the four major sports leagues make more than those in the NHL, where starters get a $115,000 salary. After a 15-year career, an NHL referee may be looking at an annual pay upwards of $220,000.”

Not bad."
"> you have to really love the game to want to be a ref

And money. The pay doesn't suck for a part time job that includes hockey. 

Honestly, as long as you don't take the jackasses personally, its not bad.Most of the dudes that go apeshit about calls don't have any clue whats in the rulebook anyway. "
Thats a nice gift from the NHL refs. I did notice the gift box was missing a blindfold thought
"Most kids want to be Star players, it's pretty cool that one wants to be a ref.  Maybe that's why OP's son stuck out to them, they probably don't get a lot of stuff from kids. "
"In 2006 my 18/19 year old friends did a road trip around the US and Canada to see hockey games. The NHL got them spots on radio shows, promoted their blog and gifted them countless stuff. 

Even from San Diego there are hardcore NHL fans! "
Getting paid to hang out on the ice with some of the best hockey players in the world sounds pretty enticing.
"Class act, unless we’re talking about Bettman."
I feel like NHL refs have a much better reputation than NBA or NCAA refs.
better than trying to be an NHL player.  In Canada it basically means horribly abusive upper middle class parents (worse one is the mom) and your first sexual experiences involve very drunk girls that your entire team takes turns on.
Dirty in legit 35 seconds though. I’d use it as decoration instead!
"I have my eye on that patch, too. Stocking stuffer maybe? "
"I loved the umpires in baseball when I was a kid (and yes, I do umpire now as a not-kid).

I asked for an autograph from Joe West once. I'm responsible for at least part of the greatest ego in sports history."
"Arguably the best view of the game, too!"
"Yeah, I don't think you're getting the e-mail of an official straight up. You'd have to e-mail the NHLOA, first (in general). Prior experience is that one of the guys responds to whatever you sent them and ""will pass it on"" to the recipient in question.

My experience was... 2013, I think. So things could be different. I don't know. (**EDIT:** I was sending a long-winded letter to a particular ref.)"
Humanizing GOD DAMN ANIMALS.
"I played two seasons in a mediocre semi-pro team after my even more mediocre junior years. I told someone I know and who's a ref I wanted to stop playing and focus on studying and work and around three weeks later I was contacted if I'd want to be become a ref. Best decision I've made in ages. They always want to get former players as referees, especially those who played at a certain level.

For others it's basically that they get either:

i) asked by their local club because they need more referees

ii) they want to ref and apply via the local governing body"
"> I always sort of wondered how people got into being a ref.

Step 1: Play hockey.

Step 2: Decide you want to make money from it

Step 3: If you're in the US, register as a ref with USA Hockey, complete the modules, open book exam, and SafeSport training, register for the nearest/best available Level 1 seminar. Contact your local ref org (name and contact info will be on the seminar registration page), and get started on your background check and anything else. 

Step 4: Do seminar, get card and patch from USAH, get ref gear.

Step 5: Get assigned, and start refing. Work games, make mistakes, get better, get evaluated, get better. Keep working up the levels, keep taking your evaluations to heart and getting better, and you'll find yourself moving up the ladder. 

Every ref district has a handful of guys on minor pro and/or NCAA assignment lists. It's an attainable goal. "

"In the NHL's justice system there are two separate, yet equally important groups. The referees who call penalties and the enforcers who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories."

No Penguins puck.  I'm gonna say no. 
"Just in case you are interested, you can be a hockey guy anywhere!  There are NHL teams in Miami, Las Vegas, and Arizona!"
"They also have the hardest jobs by a country mile and are given the least leeway by fans. They can make 30 good calls but everyone will talk about one gone wrong. All the games where the officiating is solid are ignored outright.

They're actually incredibly fit and good at their jobs. NHL fans just have no compassion for them and have unrealistic expectations. I think they forget they're human. I mean the sport is a million miles an hour and they have to make split second decisions on every shift. Players bodies pile all over the place with how it's a contact sport, and sightlines are blocked for them. 

Also, players embellish and cheat to get penalties in their favor all the time. For example, good luck distinguishing if someone's genuinely hooking someone or if the opposing player grabbed his stick, tucked it under his arm and clamped down on it to appear that way. It's just brutal.

Not to mention the NHL keeps sending mixed signals on how they want the game called.

Plus despite all the shit they take, they remain classy and professional. Respect the refs!"

"Hey you, rookie. Write something back and be nice to the kid!"
"And now he will get thousands of letters from redditors and their kids asking how to be a ref. Gradually his response letters will become more robotic and less sincere until a new rookie gets on board, and the torch will be passed again."
These comments about this guy Chmielewski are the kind of thing he'll chance on at some point and feel really good about.   There's nothing quite like strangers talking about your character in a good light.   
Aw poor guy. Only a couple years until he fucks up and starts getting hated.

I attended the Carolina Panthers Fan Fest a few years ago and I'm certain Boger was sitting next to me.

"John Wilkes Booth was misunderstood! 

"
This is the ref cam we need in our lives 
"7:42

This is gold
Was just thinking about this video the other day. Thing was crazy interesting to watch. Wish there was more stuff like this.
"Came from /r/all and I'm not really into sports but that was amazing. Is hockey always that fun to watch?

Update: watched the Carolina v Columbus game. This sport is action packed. I'm hooked on the game and on Scott Darling's goalkeeping.

Thanks /u/notleonardodicaprio"
"Oh man, I want to see one for the NHL. That makes it look kind of fun."
Professional hockey players have no idea what constitutes interference.
Love seeing the checkers on Reddit. 
"9:24 - First round's on him

"The stripes are a Penguins jersey, duh."

"Well, there it is."
Y u do dis?
"A stat that usually belongs to the ducks. But there’s an ebb and flow.

Don't you mean third round?
Did you watch the playoffs last year? 
QQ
"What, now you want the refs to know the rules too?! There's no satisfying you people."
"Some of the other comments were funny, but a bit more obvious. This one has me trying not to lose my shit and wake up the kids."
"I'M BLIND, I'M DEAF, I WANNA BE A REF"

"Yeah, watching your team get killed can get pretty boring "
"Can confirm. I have a game-used puck from an AHL game in my room. Years ago, a linesman handed it to me personally. No publicity. Just handed it to me after the game. Wasn't told to do that by the other officials.

You'll sometimes see officials giving pucks to kids before the game. A Hockey Fights Cancer night last season had two kids drop one puck for the team's ceremony. Knowing that the kids were probably going to fight over the puck, a referee gets one from the guy in the penalty box. As the kids were walking off the ice, the ref manages to catch one of them to give him a puck of his own."
"So quit?

Beer league center.  If all you're going to do is call offsides and do shitty faceoffs it's only a matter of time before a game gets out of hand and someone gets hurt "
Why do you keep doing it if you hate it?
"It’s also cool because of how much more realistic the goal is. Millions of kids have tried to be the next Gretzky, how many have tried to be the next Wes McCauley?"
"You may hate him but you can't say he hasn't been effective at growing the NHL and making much, much more profitable than it was.

He may he a tone deaf, heartless, cold lawyer ... but he's done a fantastic job at cultivating the league.

Get @ me downvotes."
"I don't watch enough NBA or NCAA to have my own opinion, but I don't doubt that for a second haha"
Don't even bring up soccer
"A lot of NCAA refs from big conferences get hired to be pro refs so obviously it's a lower level

The NBA's rules are so ticky tack it's hard to be consistent in that league"
"Considering it's been proven that NBA refs can be bought, yeah NHL refs have a much better reputation."
Could be worse. Could be MLS refs.
"Probably because 1) NHL gets less coverage here in the US, so any controversial call isn't discussed ad nauseum by the E!$PN talking heads and 2) I'd say that ""most"" calls leading to anything of consequence (i.e. a goal) are reviewable.

"Except massive organizations like the NHL have PR pros who are very good at their job, so there's a decent chance half his time is devoted to league rep now.  Including training and interns, so his replies can appear sincere and thoughtful and dank 100% of the time.

something something capitalism (except that sub is fucking garbage)"
"I’m sure the NHL’s PR team know about this thread, they probably emailed him about it or will today"
Only if you're calling a Pens game and Crosby does anything short of murder.
Damn you weren't kidding. I've seen NFL players who wish they had arms like him.
A lot of the refs are lawyers in the off-season
I want to be.. Ed Hochuli 
Also the name of an up and coming post punk hard core band. Google EDHOCHULI. Intense amazing stuff!
"He’s a partner at a law firm in Arizona. Also a super nice guy, got the pleasure to meet him once. "
"Does anyone else say ""Hercules! Hercules!"" when they see or hear his name? Or am I just weird?"
"He's usually awesome but I was peeved when he told Cam Newton that he wasn't ""old enough to get that call."""
Hes a fucking terrible ref though. His crew is one of the worst in football. 
"[Another Hochuli classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u2kXnGov9w)

I've always appreciated how verbose and detailed he is in his explanations. I mean, he *is* a lawyer, but still, it's nice."

She just seems like a really good-natured person.
"She is a great ref. First female ref in the Bundesliga and she's been picked, more than once I believe, to work the FIFA women's World Cup final. Also at least one Olympic gold medal game. "
She's a really great ref.  I've been watching her in women's tournaments for years and I rarely come out of the game thinking she did a poor job.
Oh I just immediately assume anyone involved with rugby while on the field is bad ass tbf.

This videos the reason I know about him!
"I try not to blame the chief, he’s essentially responsible and taking the blame for the calls that 6 other guys make. "
"Every ref in every sport has made his share of bad calls. We give them shit, but it's an extremely hard job to be in the fray like that and make split-second judgments in real time."

From what I've seen it's more detrimental to their eyesight. 
For context your normal speaking voice should be ~60 DB and extended exposure to anything ~80+ causes permanent damage.
"As an amateur sound engineer, I unfortunately know that anything about 80 or higher is not good for you. For soccer referees it's not as big of an issue, because the noise is partly going away from you. For hockey referees, the closer you get to the boards, the more that sound could be coming back at you and damaging your ears.

tl;dr: yes, it can be bad, but probably not as end of the world as you might assume."
I'd imagine it's so instantaneous and short term that it wouldn't cause lasting damage
"The maximum suggested exposure per day at that volume is 5 minutes. I've never timed whistles but I'm  guessing they're under that, especially if you look at each ref on their own.

What is likely worse is the arena noise itself. For a 3 hour game, 90 dB is the suggested level. The average noise level during an average game is in the high 90s and playoff games can get into the hundreds. I'd say that anyone who frequently attends NHL games without wearing earplugs is risking hearing damage. Players, fans, officials, etc. We probably all should be wearing hearing protection at most professional sporting events. "
"There is a [muscle in the ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle) that can help close off the canal [if a loud noise is expected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex).  It probably will still add up, but since their brain knows when to expect it, it isn't as bad.  

If a player is running by when it goes off, it will hurt them a lot more."
"Yes, it definitely can lead to noise induced hearing loss or quicken the rate of age related hearing loss. Both can be severe and life altering. "
At extended exposure (say a concert) you can do irreparable damage at 85 dB.
"So assuming 105 db, there's a limit to the exposure [here](http://www.sengpielaudio.com/NIOSH-OSHA-Standards.gif). You'll notice OSHA and NIOSH have different levels, we'll just go with the NIOSH as safe. So  a ref could listen to the whistle for about 5 minutes as safe, yet most whistles are short. We're talking about like 1 second, often reaching the 100db+ peak for a shorter length in many context. That's 300 whistle per ref per game game and still fine. 600 game then. How often does a whistle blow in a game, 50 times? Maybe 25 per ref? Very unlikely to reach the 1 ever 6 seconds that is the max.

So while the whistle in long enough context could cause damage, in a typical refs use, it will not cause sufficient damage."
Short whistles at that level are fine. If it were long and sustained it might become an issue. They are more likely to be deafened by the goal horns or canon in Columbus.
"> Honest question since I don't know what dB level is dangerous: could that be bad for a ref's ears after 15+ years?

Don't know but I have very sensitive ears for some reason(used to test a full tone higher and lower than everyone else when I was a kid) and after a couple games in a day my ears are ringing.  "
"Probably. Luckily, my ears are already fucked from the army. "
I'm impressed that multiple people know specific whistle brands/models. 
"I use the acme tornado 2000's, myself for soccer. I don't mind fox, but everyone uses them, and the dB range on the tornado is a bit higher, and I like the pitch better. I used the thunderers a couple times and I feel like the pitch is better than on the super forces, too."
"Was pumped about the care package until I saw the whistles. 

Fox 40s suck, Acme Thunderers forever. "
"I'm with ya here, I feel like it takes too much effort to blow the 40's"
"I'm team Acme as well, but only because you can buy them anywhere, unlike the Fox's that you have to hunt down. "
"Actually I prefer the [acme tornado 2000's](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2Bf9ZpdaOL._SY355_.jpg), but I used to use pearls doing games on fields next to each other/near each other for the difference in tone so players don't get confused. I don't do many games like that any more, though, so I've stuck to the tornado mostly. I got the super forces kind of as a joke, honestly, but I have used them for indoor matches and a rec game here or there. All good stuff though."
should have probably added that I didn't start refereeing until I left the nest
"My mom always made things quietly disappear, then said ""oh, I haven't seen it lately"" when asked about it. I didn't catch on until well into high school."
"This would be a 10 games suspension in our Swiss League. We had 2 cases of ""checks against Refs"" within the last 2 years and one was a 5 games suspension I think and one was 3 games. But those were really just players skating into a Ref. Over here the number 1 rule is: ""You do not make any contact with a Ref""  


This here however? I mean, he can clearly see him and then just sort of cross checks him? Looks kind of scary and intentional. I am surprised they did not follow up on that. Was that really because they said he didn't know what he was doing because of the concussion?"
No motive... concussed
[is this related](https://www.therecord.com/sports-story/7961093-kitchener-rangers-hire-dennis-wideman-as-an-assistant-coach/)
"I go to a hockey camp in Minnesota every year; been going for about 6 years now. First couple of years I was there Jake Brenk was a coach. At the time he was still trying to break in as a player, and man, is he a smooth skater and a big guy. Seeing that he couldn't make it as a player really opened my eyes to how hard it is to be an NHL player (just as much as having actual NHL players come and do drills with us sometimes -- those guys are big and so fast).

I was really glad when he made it as a ref, actually got to see him ref a game in Denver last year. He's a great guy, too, always positive and encouraging."
Down ya go bud.
I lost at that part. And the “I had that gallon of coffee before the game!”

As far as hating it, that's all in my head. I really want to do a good job and I stress myself out. Every time I think I maybe missed a call, or made a bad call I tend to beat myself up over it. 

Being a ref is a lot of responsibly in my mind. Even just beginner beer league. None of my guys are going pro, ever, but they should still get the best officiating I can offer.

So, it's not that I'm being lazy about it, it's that I take it too damn seriously. And it's tough too, at that it's really hard to tell if it was a trip or if some beginner just fell off his skates."
"Somebody needs to do it, and it's part of my overall job.

"Is it really though? 42 refs, 80 officials, but like 700+ players.

I can't think of a better example of sports leadership. It's poignant considering what's going on with the NFL lately, which used to be the [runaway leader](http://www.businessinsider.com/attendance-sports-leagues-world-2015-5) just two years ago. If you want to know why [NHL attendance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures#Top_leagues_in_total_attendance) exceeds NFL attendance now, and is one of the most rapidly growing sports league, just consider it's also one of the few places where sportsmanlike conduct extends beyond the players.

"Eh I guess not really extended exposure then tbh. Considering construction workers get like an hour of consistent noise I guess it's negligible for refs. 

And anyone wondering why voice and permanent damage are so close together, the dB scale is logarithmic so it's not linearly comparable. "
"85, and ""extended exposure"" is a bit misleading there because at 85 dB you could withstand up to 8 hours a day without hearing loss.

For every 3 dB above that, the exposure limit is halved (so at 88 dB it's 4 hours, at 91 dB it's 2 hours, etc)

With regards to your [other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/7g0ksd/my_son_whos_in_3rd_grade_wants_to_be_an_nhl/dqftsok/), it's cumulative over a 24 hour period. Construction workers legally should be working in noise levels below this, but those regulations are not often strictly enforced and in some cases very hard to do so."
"The dB scale is also logarithmic (base 10)

100 dB is 10,000x louder than 60dB

"
Damn I really need to start wearing earplugs at work
" Off topic but,  how bad for people that hunt without ear plugs? 

"
"Additionally, refs are generally facing towards the play rather than the boards, so the rebounding effect wouldn't be as bad (I assume)."
"Don't forget though that they work in hockey arenas, which aren't necessarily quiet workplaces.  And do a lot of flying.  So overtime that constant level of somewhat, but not painfully, loud noises probably isn't great for hearing. "
That's why any ref would prefer to call and offside rather than risj a goal and have to hear the crowd roar and the goal horn and goal music. Just safe work practice.
Yeah dude I didn't even know so much variety existed.
"Theres only a few that are widely used, I reffed in my teenage years and when i was in ""ref school"" they told me i could buy any whistle i wanted as long as it was an Acme Thunderer. That's what everyone used, it just has the right sound and volume.  although,  as said above there are a few other models used"
Lots of people interested in hockey enough to post on the internet about are (or were) refs at one point or another. It's a tough job. Parents are the worst.
"Probably a lot of current/former refs in here

"Ive always felt that the whistle from the foxes dont really get a reaction from players compared to others. The whistle from an acme just ""feels"" right to me, i dont really know how to describe it "
Do different brands make different notes?
I forgot my whistle (back when i first started and didnt carry a backup) before a game once and the pro shop only carried 40s. I was curious to try a new type of whistle so I didnt realize how much that sucked until I blew my whistle to start the game. It felt like it hardly even made a noise and sounded more flat than the crisp sound a whistle should make. After the game i immediatly ordered some thunders (and some backups) and havent touched the 40s since. 
this guy whistles
"I come from a really big family, and when I was a kid my mom found a really clever way to communicate to us when we would be in large public places where we might spread out, such as a park, etc. She kept a whistle in her purse and gave it a good blast when she wanted to round us up, and we all knew to come running. 

Well, one day it was really hot and we were all at the beach at a local lake, which was very busy. We had been there for a while and it was time to go, so mom blew the whistle. Suddenly, probably 150 people who were swimming heard what they thought was the lifeguard's whistle telling them to get out of the water for the hourly clear out, and all of them swim toward the shore and come back up to the beach. 

Mom was mortified (as were my teenage sisters), the lifeguard was confused, and most everyone at the beach was a bit frustrated that their swim was cut short for no apparent reason. I think that was the last time she used the whistle!"
"[From what I've read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Wideman#Abuse_of_Linesman_Incident) Wideman was suspended 20 games, but after appeal it was brought down to 10.

"Wiseman received a 20 game suspension. The ref also received a concussion and will never work as a ref again, so he is suing Wideman for $10 million. Pretty sure his playing career is over as well, since he is not currently signed. 

So it’s not like Wideman got off easy. "

Yeah but I imagine there's also way more guys trying to make the NHL as players. Most of the guys reffing probably do it for part-time income and don't see it as a career path.
Talk to me when you see an AAC game as they struggle to meet their 1 targeting call per game quota

My understanding is that the damage to the hair cells is cumulative. I believe that the issue with construction workers is often the totality of what they are subjected to and less about especially loud incidents.

"> 85, and ""extended exposure"" is a bit misleading there because at 85 dB you could withstand up to 8 hours a day without hearing loss.

If you go unprotected for 8 hours at 85dB you will definitely get hearing loss. Whoever told you otherwise is either a lobbyist or an idiot."
"Very bad. Shoot a rifle once and you'll see. It hurts your brain. That's why they are trying to ""legalize"" suppressors (silencers) so you can shoot/hunt without damaging your ears . Note that it doesn't make a gun silent like in the movies, it's still very loud, just bearable.

"If ""it's not a bloody cut off"" why does France cut it off at 80 dB? I know it's not a cut but for simplicity sake the number is put somewhere, which France is also doing. Which you're doing, by citing France.

And could you please provide a source for that? I don't know what you mean by ""it"" in ""In France it's 80 db"" - in the US it's not a level that's decreed that ""you should wear ear plugs,"" it's a level that it's decreed that employers must provide them. There are different situations for when an employee is required to wear them (at https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3074/osha3074.html, but can be situational, even for levels below 85 dB). 

I'm not an expert on EU laws, but what I'm finding is that the [European Union requires the provision of hearing protection at 80 dB, but does not make it mandatory for workers until the 85 dB level.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32003L0010) That doesn't seem to state which level is considered hazardous.

Yes, I understand it's not a strict value, and I understand that there's a lot of variation. A lot. The only time you're going to find a constant 80 dB sound is in a controlled experiment where neither the noise source nor the recipient is moving. 

For example, with your diesel truck, ""near"" is pretty poorly defined. If ""near"" is 1 meter away from the truck, I could cut the amount of noise exposure I have by standing 2 m away, which is still ""near"" the truck. That's about 6 dB of a cut, meaning even if the sound was 85 dB at 1 m, I'm still in the ""safe"" range below 80 (unless you want to cite - actually cite - something else that says noises below 80 dB are harmful).

And not only does the variance of noise cause complications, people vary as well, and some people are less susceptible to hearing loss than others. The 
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health states ""With a 40-year lifetime exposure at the 85-dBA REL, the excess risk of developing occupational NIHL is 8%"" meaning that, yes, you are correct, but only a small portion of the time. Sure, 80 dB for 8 hours can damage some people's ears, yes, but that doesn't mean it will cause damage for anyone, or most everyone really.

And yes, I am already half deaf. I have 40 dB hearing loss in both ears due to noise induced hearing loss from when I was younger."
"A 12ga is WAY louder than a .22

[Here's](http://m14forum.com/hearing/78442-various-noise-levels-firearms.html) a link. .22 is 130dB, 12ga is 151-161db. That's a pretty good difference. "
A 22 is super quiet.
Adding to the shittiness is that the league was already pushing Henderson out the door. It was his last season.  And Wideman denied him his last few NHL games.

">f ""it's not a bloody cut off"" why does France cut it off at 80 dB?

Because we have better unions and governments who care for it's people's health. And because we have to set a target number. But just because France says hearing protection is mandatory at 80db does not mean that anything below is safe.

>I'm not an expert on EU laws, but what I'm finding is that the European Union requires the provision of hearing protection at 80 dB, but does not make it mandatory for workers until the 85 dB level.

OK? Who gives a fuck about the EU seriously? 

>Yes, I understand it's not a strict value, and I understand that there's a lot of variation. A lot. The only time you're going to find a constant 80 dB sound is in a controlled experiment where neither the noise source nor the recipient is moving. 

Or, you know, the average sound pressure level in a factory.

>With a 40-year lifetime exposure at the 85-dBA REL, the excess risk of developing occupational NIHL is 8%

"> we have to set a target number

Precisely. That's what the CDC is doing as well. We're arguing the same thing here, which is what I said in my last post. If you want to keep arguing about the existence of a cut off, it's you arguing with yourself basically.

If you're going by averaged numbers, i.e. the ""average sound pressure level in a factory"", that's where you're going to get in trouble. Averaging over a logarithmic function is going to misrepresent how much sound energy you're receiving. 85 dB for 4 hours and 75 dB for 4 hours does not average to 80 dB over the 8 hours.

I'd care about the EU because you still haven't sourced the France number, so as it stands that's the only verifiable information we have for France. You don't have a source for ""It will damage anyone's ears"" either."
"Don't think so.  Given how much legal drama followed (including all the suspension controversy), that was probably a good idea.

I'm not trusting some random dude on the internet, certainly not one that's already deaf from exposure to sound. I'm trusting decades of research on the subject. I'm trusting the scientific knowledge about how ears work. I'm trusting general knowledge.

You trust the OSHA, which FYI is not actually a research lab.

>In other words, I don't trust you when you say those are the numbers for France.

Yeah definitely didn't see that one. I can see how that would have complicated matters.
"You're not following that I [sourced NIOSH](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/7g0ksd/my_son_whos_in_3rd_grade_wants_to_be_an_nhl/dqhfqxl/). NIOSH is responsible for conducting research. Furthermore, if you want to follow ""decades of research... scientific knowledge... [and] general knowledge"" that paper that I sourced in that comment has 17 pages of references that span decades. And many papers reference OSHA and NIOSH, so if you're concerned about them as a source, you might want to double check your sources sources, as they could be OSHA or NIOSH. On that note, I don't understand why you seem to be discrediting NIOSH as a source when it's partnered with INRS - that is, they trust each other and use each other's work. You're trusting NIOSH by trusting INRS, in other words. 

For instance, [this is a paper published by INRS that references both NIOSH and the 85 dB level](http://en.inrs.fr/dms/inrs/PDF/INRS_rapport-SST_EN_WEB.pdf/INRS_rapport%20SST_EN_WEB2.pdf) Seems to be another instance where you're arguing against yourself.

And they don't state at what level hearing damage can occur at that link provided, they just state what actions should be taken at those levels. They don't even say that those levels are considered hazardous on that page. If there's a statement that says something like ""Noises at or above 80 dB for extended periods of time will cause hearing loss"" I haven't found it there.

That's unlike the statements published by NIOSH, which directly stated that only 8% of the people they studied suffered hearing loss at the 85 dB level."
">  they just state what actions should be taken at those levels.

Exactly. Just like, oh gosh, the NIOSH. Go figure!

>which directly stated that only 8% of the people they studied suffered hearing loss at the 85 dB level.

Wthout defining what amount of ""hearing loss"" they are talking about.

Thanks but no thanks. 

Look, if you want to keep your ears unprotected when subjected to 80db for 8 hours, go right ahead, i'm not going to stop you. But, you know, maybe that's why you're deaf.

"
"Just like NIOSH? They stated that 8% of the population they studied got hearing loss at the 85 dB level. INRS does not make that statement, or state that hearing loss can occur at the 80 dB / 8 hour level. How are those just like each other?

You are correct that they don't define how much. When a numerical value is undefined, the statement is binary - i.e. they experienced a positive amount of hearing loss. Meaning 92% of their subjects experienced no hearing loss. ""How much"" has been outside the scope of this discussion, but if you do want to talk about that you'd have to agree on what levels cause hearing loss before we can discuss how much hearing loss those levels cause."
"How about a challenge.

Go stand 5m away from a revving truck for 8 hours, without ear protections, and tell me how you feel afterwards.

You'll probably be fine, though, you're already half deaf from unprotected exposure to loud noises. oops."
"That's not how hearing loss works. Even at a 40 dB hearing loss level, 85 dB - 40 dB is still 85 dB, and I'd have essentially the same threat as anyone else. That I already experience tinnitus means that I'm going to ""feel"" worse than them, as a baseline. In case you didn't know, permanent hearing loss is chronic, meaning I'm always suffering from it.

That you seem to be trying to attack my disability without adding anything constructive to this conversation is quaint. That you're still getting it wrong during those attacks is even more unfortunate.

Look, I understand if France wants to be extra safe and set their exposure levels below 85. And it's true, there isn't much research done between 80 and 85, so there is still the potential for some damage there, but the research done at the 85 dB level is conclusive enough to show that for the majority of people, hearing loss will not occur."

Pitt is shorthand for the college because it's a logical abbreviation, and they roast people here for making that connection and *not* referring to the school."

"Hockey players give the most mundane interviews, but the wittiest chirps.  I wish the NHL encouraged players to be themselves a bit more.

Spittin Chicklets Podcast has been great for a deeper delve in to a players' psyche.  Commodore, Bissonette, Eichel, Thornton and Hall all gave excellent interviews.  I think the chemistry works better with a former NHLer asking the questions, and essentially, not giving a fuck what he asks."
Aaaaand I'm a Nick Bonino fan
I wish I could up vote this more than the allotted amount  
"The way fans act about players who end up signing elsewhere can be so absurd. I'll never forget the shit Okposo took on twitter for not saying ""thank you/goodbye"" to fans quick enough or some shit like that. Made me embarrassed to be a fan. "
Right? They know chirps AND suits. OWNED.
"Love that word chirp, never heard it used like that before, is this common parlance in Pittsbird?  "
Lmfao Bonino with the zing
"As a West Virginia Mountaineer, I'd STILL insist they spelled Shitt/Shittsburgh wrong 😉"
I don't get it
I have the opposite problem this guy does. The sleeves on my suites are always to short for my arms 
He's saying his sleeve is slightly too long for his arm? Am I missing something or are people here just massively over-exaggerating the harshness of this burn?
"Hey, this guy is alright!  🤣"
Fucking ruthless. I love it!
They'll ride up with wear.
That is one awfully fitting jacket. Dude needs to see a tailor before he wears that thing again.

Would have been more analogous if the guy had long arms and sleeves that were too short or saying that the douche trying to squeeze the long sleeves onto his short arm.

"But the analogy is wrong... If his tweet space were his sleeve, he would have too much arm to fit there... There's nothing funnier than a wrong insult. It just makes me giggle inside."
"Wait, wouldn't the arm be sticking way out of the sleeve if this joke made sense?"
That's the lamest chirp of all time tho

But... It's the opposite of trying to fit his arm into that long sleeve. Now I hate Bonino even more.
"The chirp kinda doesn't make sense though...not enough arm for too big of space, vs too many words for too lil of space. Still roasted but not rekt."
"Most hockey players chirps are pretty weak outside the rink in my experience. Most of the good shit I heard was directed at players, outside the rink it was shite. This however is savage. 

Edit: looks like I struck a nerve with some hockey players with little to no chirping skills. A little self conscious about your chirping abilities there aren't we..."

no consequences online - in real life bonino punches him in the face
haha I went to high school with this kid... he always seemed like a pretty big douche too. kinda feel bad for him but he was pretty much asking for it
"lol I do it just to get a reaction. I don't really care what people say and I could get roasted but I find it all in good fun. [I got roasted by samsung](https://twitter.com/savedward/status/855477880683286530) 

I try to be the first to post about it though to go viral and going viral may seem like a dumb reason to post something, but that tweet helped me get clients for my photography business, introduced me into people who showed me around town when I traveled (in San Francisco and San Diego)

I never went private though. I could handle it. I don't know why people tweet like that if they can't handle the roast"
"Went to high school with this dude, huge douche"
Don't have to act like a cock when you're already a cock.
"Yeah, especially to famous athletes or actors who are actually known as very sympathetic individuals. Why would you try and insult them? I love when celebrities reply and put the 'haters' in place."
"> so this guy feels like he has to be a cock about it for no reason?

Typical penguins fan"
Pittsburgh fan what can you expect. Probably didn't know the team before last year.
"When you're a nobody on the internet, it's really easy to just be a negative fucktard online and not expect anyone of any real stature to have the time or inclination to respond to random insults.  That's what makes it so fun when they do. 

 I mean seriously, that is a real ill-fitting jacket."
Probably a dickhead caps fan
As someone who has been a cock online before... I'm betting booze was involved.
Is there a subreddit for this?
"I hate some Pittsburgh fans, and I'm saying that as someone from Pittsburgh. Bonino played a huge role in getting us back to back cups, no reason to shit on him when he leaves."

"In fairness to him, these types of comments dont usually get answered. Doesnt answer the question of ""why"", but these comments are pretty universal. People are assholes when they think they can get away with it, you fucking dick! "
Looks like he now just straight up deleted it lol.
"Honestly all he has to say is ""lol, got me there"" and he'd be an internet good guy. How are people so embarrassed on the internet that they have to delete everything? Maybe divorce, criminal, etc but a dumb comment? Just own up that you got burned."
"His new profile pic was his hand in that picture wasnt it?
"
Haha what a guy. Thinnest skin around
"> fans need to realize that.

Fans do realize that. Jagoff armchair hockey players who never made it in beer league and are still mad at Jagr for leaving do not."
"At some point, these guys have to put their family first. It's a brutal game, he shouldn't ever have to take less than he's worth. That's how the league is meant to maintain parity.

It's damn rude to tell a man to earn less."
"Yeah, people should stop feeling betrayed or angry, we should instead be grateful, this guy as Kunitz gave their all for the team and will be missed.

at least Bones went to a team in the west, so few games against them; I'll always have a soft spot for him and his new team.

In the end, this is their job, they also need to think in their future and families, and having a chance for a step up is something people would naturally take on."
Especially when he leaves like this. Dude was a key player in back to back cup runs and goes out on top. Bones deserves to get paid. It's not like he pulled a Hossa. 
And there's no reason to be mad that the pens won't (read cant) pay them that. Most centers in the league would wind up 3rd liners because of crosby and malkin. With a salary cap theres no real way to pay guys who'd be a 1st or 2nd like forward on just about any team what they are worth.

Or spend $30-60 to have it fitted.
lol what? You have it fitted to where it shows like an inch or whatever of your shirt with your hands at your sides and not really care what it looks like if you have to raise your arms (which isn't often in situations while wearing a suit)
"I found the rocket league player!

No problem."
"In one sentence, he implied  the guy's too small for his clothes, too poor to afford tailoring, and too dumb to understand Twitter abbreviations."
He's indirectly telling the guy to work out to fit into that shirt. 
ya but i think we all have enough common sense to recognize that the point of the insult is to direct attention to the fact that his suit was not fitted properly and he should feel bad about it 
"""Why don't you dye your hair"""

40m. How?
"First of all, ""I make a lot of money"" is not a refutation of criticism. Transformers 2 made a lot of money, that doesn't mean it was good. Second of all ""you live in your mom's basement"" is the most tired, uncreative, and overused ad hom response to criticism on the fucking internet.

A guy called me 4 eyes once as a chirp. (I was a 15 year old backup goalie for a junior b game and had my glasses on) This guy was 20 and I tore him apart for that chirp. Something along the lines of you've been sitting on the bench for 5 years of junior and that's the best you got? The best chirps are original chirps.
But that's the way it is tho.
"I dunno, you suck at hockey has a charm of its own. It's devastating because Doughty didn't even see the need to get mad or creative, he just cut right through the chirping. "
"To be fair, there's no really clever response to that.  It's like calling someone a blowjob (Russell Peters has a great bit on that)."

Hey Pittsburg is a nice city. Just ask the announcers. 
"To be fair, I'm sure a bunch of other dumbass random people have started horribly harassing him well beyond anything he deserves. Like people take this shit too serious, and the same mentality that led this guy to tweeting the original tweet at Bonino exists in other people who are probably telling him to kill himself and other awful, disgusting things. So I don't fully blame him.

That being said, none of it would have happened if he just minded his own business."
Looks like it's deleted now 
"It would be beneath a pro athlete to obsessively go on the offensive (think Trump), but a quick, execution-style hit like this is fine."
"In real life, Bonino takes the Roy approach and puts his rings in his ears"
"That's an interesting perspective. I would have also thought that that tweet would have made you look worse, but I guess it's true that all publicity is good publicity. I'm glad it worked out.

I also think your tweet was more good natured. Like you were just joking around. This guy was responding to a thank you tweet trying to shit on Bonino and his contributions to the city. I see that as different than the example you gave. You didn't tweet back at Samsung and tell them that their product is garbage (a company is different from a person, though). A better example would be if you tweeted at whoever designed the phone and told them they're a failure and stupid or something. That's more of what I'm talking about, not responding to an ad campaign with a harmless joke."

So you do it for the lolz 
I'm confused; what did Samsung say to you that was insulting? I see like an emoji of something but I can't even read it.
I use Reddit for like four sports subs and occasionally lurk AskReddit. I am the wrong person to ask.
"[Holy shit, you're right](https://twitter.com/Dflaherty88). Must have one fragile ego to up and delete his entire Twitter account because of one devastatingly good comeback.

Don't dish it out if you can't take it, I guess."
Absolutely fuckin rekt. Hope he's not a redditor
I don't think it's embarrassment but more of that people were probably harrasing him.
Its still hilarious how people dont understand the harassment you can experience from die hard fans that spend all their time on twitter defending their idols.
this - humility is the best way to save face...
"Fragile ego, perhaps? It's like the redditors who get called out in a /r/quityourbullshirt-type moment and delete their entire account in response."
How can anyone be mad at Jagr.
Upvote for Jagoff.
"I watched that documentary that was posted a few days ago, and Jagr was saying he gets booed every time he comes back, but he's pretty sure the people who boo him were too young to see him play. He then went on to say how amazing Pittsburgh is and how it was his home and how much fun he had here. "

"To be fair, it's unusual for a Cup-winning team to retain as many players for the next season as we did."
"You still have your franchise duo that has won three cups, each has at least one season mvp, finals mvp, gold with their country, been leading scorer.

I think it might be okay."
"Normally cup winning teams lose some talent they picked up via trades or because their contracts are ending.

The top 6 players are still there, Schultz has been re-signed, Tanger, Olli and Murray... We still need #3C, and probably a #4 if Cullen isn't re-signed. But if anything I'd say the current management is very good at finding talent. And there are other guys ready to get a chance."
"Oh just wait. We're gonna be even better than last year. Younger, faster. Good times ahead, my man."

The cheese is alright, but it's nothing special. Ive had Philly cheese steaks with shitty meat, and I've had them with amazing meat. Primantis is just average meat. It isn't all just deli meats...

Also, there are many different types of coleslaw, fries and bread. There are a lot of sandwich places in this world, primantis having the best bread is something special. Same with the fries, they're good fries but other places have better ones that would improve the sandwiches. "

You'd be surprised how many small patrons I have though who think being a librarian sounds awesome. I think maybe being a young librarian makes them realize it's an actual career option, though.

"I saw Frankie Muniz at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

I agree.

I agree. It's well-done hamburger meat, hence the name. I don't like it, but a whole lot of people do. Just like a whole lot of people like fast food hamburgers, which the Pittsburgher is a riff on. If you don't like well done burgers, you probably won't like a sandwich that's a permutation of a fast food burger.

IMO, ordering the Pittsburgher is a rookie mistake. Capicolla, pastrami, and corned beef are far superior choices."

"My dad would take me to the library a lot when he was a kid, when he was younger he dropped out of university and I really think he regrets not getting more of an education. And that made him want to get me really involved with reading when I was younger, I was in a few programs at my local library and I still read a lot to this day.       

I think the new technology each year is definitely gonna affect how many people visit the library and how much kids get involved with it.

In a 140 character Tweet, a hockey player used the abbreviation in a context that clearly referred to the city, not the university, as people sometimes do.  An idiot with 42 inch arms wearing a 48 inch jacket took offense for some reason and publicly accused the hockey player of villainy, which back fired spectacularly when the hockey player graciously reiterated his sentiment for the city while simultaneously bringing humorous attention to the idiot's ill fitting suit and lack of social graces.

Some grow to love Columbus and make it their home, and that's great, but how could I ever feel more connected to that than my school? Those are my peers. When I was in school, I saw them in the diner, I went to class with them, I experienced the same campus culture, etc. It's just so much more meaningful to me.

I'm a Maryland alum, by the way."
"I may not have made it clear enough.  My bad on that one.  But yes I agree with that and it's the worst.  I've been in Columbus and many parts of Ohio and its just OSU everywhere.  Maybe it's due to the their NFL teams sucking, idk, but I feel weird (I know this is somewhat another conversation) when you have a huge following and a large portion of that following never attended the school.  

I don't know how true this is, but I am at least relatively inclined to believe this, but I've heard employers (PSU alum) prioritize PSU grads, which I don't agree with.  It should always be the best.  Now, don't get me wrong, I know PSU is known for engineering so I understand employers associated with that may at least put those resumes on top.  However, when there's nothing special aside from PSU then it's not cool.

Again, though, as a disclaimer I don't have any data to back this up."
"Our hockey program is 10/10, I love it. But CFB will always be my favorite sports"
🙄 well...at least you're not Rutgers or MSU. I can live with agreeing with a Maryland alum
"Everyone has inherent biases. I guarantee OSU grads will prioritize other OSU grad applicants if all other things are fairly equal. You chose your university, and assuming you enjoyed your time, you want to assist other people that went to the same.


It might be particularly visible for PSU since we have more living alumni than any other university and heavily focus on networking for the students, but that happens anywhere."

On ice it was fine, but behind the scenes it has always been a shitshow in Edmonton since their inception.

Edmonton was lucky enough to one, have been picked to move into the NHL, and more importantly two, Gretzky's agent told him to sign in Edmonton instead of Winnipeg.

And FFS, they ended up trading Gretzky for nothing, for no good reason really.

It's become even more of an old boys' club in terms of who's actually calling the shots in the organization and Katz has done nothing to help.  Not to mention the terrible timing of when they fire and hire new management personnel."

"You do know they won a cup without Gretzky right? You do know Pronger and Peca were on that last cup run right? The we-didn't-get-McDavid salt train is still going strong. 

You guys haven't won a Cup since before the Vietnam War. Since the lockout you've made the playoffs TWICE which is exactly how many times the Oilers have made it. 

One season isn't going as planned and you act like we weren't a goal away from the conference finals last year. Get off your high horse."
"Instead of berating others below, you shouldn't act like you know what you're talking about. The Oilers didn't hold shit in 2006, nevermind a playoff spot. If it weren't for the shit show that was the Canucks finish to the regular season, the Oilers would've never snuck into that 8th spot. Stick to topics you know. It's the r/hockey Oilers suck circle jerk preventing you from being downvoted into oblivion. "
"joke is that, Edmonton has been getting A LOT of the higher drafts picks lately (especially a few #1 picks). "
I certainly am. I'm not sure why you're not.
Okay with what? A joke piece about a horribly run professional hockey team?

Edmonton bowed down to Chicago in that game

"This comment I made in another thread today is a pretty decent glimpse at events this year:

> It feels like there are so many things that have either completely or partially been a disaster for this team that Saad having a down year in production is a drop in the bucket. Off the top of my head: the powerplay, Keith's 0 goals, the inconsistency of Toews, overall lack of puck luck (Panik's wide open net whiff comes to mind), defense taking nights off (nothing new), no Hossa, losing Crawford, losing AA for a while (while already missing Crawford), Berube being injured in Rockford which cause Glass to be called up, rarely playing a full 20 minutes let alone 60, the powerplay again because it's that bad yet not Oilers bad. Those terrible pilgrim collars on the jerseys. Hell, even Edzo is out.

That's what happens to teams after they win the Stanley Cup a few times thanks to league parity with the draft and the salary cap. What's your excuse?
Hey we're shitting on your team right now stop trying to change the topic
At this point I'm just glad we're actually still *IN* the standings at all.
Did we get more first overall picks than Chicago scored goals in last years playoffs?
I like to pretend we broke them.

And took Strome 
">Coyotes were the real loser there.

Sadly that statement fits in pretty much any hockey conversation.

Anyway yes, yes we were. I was just trying to give you guys your due for the master tank job but still getting screwed out of McDavid. Eichel is about as good of a consolation prize as it gets. btw...Auston Matthews was only 2 days from being eligible for that draft. I wish death to the hockey gods, fuck them!"
Th...anks.
"> And us beating the Sabres in one of the last games of the season to push us to the #2 pre lotto spot.

The Coyotes have made an art out of winning games that not only don't matter but actively hurt the organization. That will go down as the dumbest win in the history of hockey.

"What are you talking about?  The team behind the scenes has always been a shitshow, but sorry you can't read.  What happened to the team after?  

Besides, why do you all keep bringing up 2006?  You didn't win.

Sorry all you fans downvoting are just so salty the organization is still terrible with the best player in the world on the team."

"**Hustler Magazine v. Falwell**

Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit public figures from recovering damages for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), if the emotional distress was caused by a caricature, parody, or satire of the public figure that a reasonable person would not have interpreted as factual.

In an 8–0 decision, the Court ruled in favor of Hustler magazine, holding that a parody ad published in the magazine depicting televangelist and political commentator Jerry Falwell as an incestuous drunk, was protected speech since Falwell was a public figure and the parody could not have been reasonably considered believable. Therefore, the Court held that the emotional distress inflicted on Falwell by the ad was not a sufficient reason to deny the First Amendment protection to speech that is critical of public officials and public figures.

So don't come in here berating Oilers fans like Edmonton is top destination for players and we just didn't manage to cherry pick the best of the best wanting to play in the city. You're either too young or your hockey knowledge is shit, but the Oilers and the Flames had a hard time assembling great teams at the time due to a weak Canadian Dollar and an undesirable market for free agents. I even had to buy lottery tickets so Alberta teams would stick around. But yeah, according to you every Canadian team has a 10 million strong potential fan base at their doorstep with no competition.

"He's like the best backup you can have, but I thought it was kinda obvious that starting a guy who'd never played the workload of a starter professionally was never going to put up the same numbers he did backing up.

"It would probably be better for the game as a whole if arguably the best young player the league has ever seen wasn't wasting away on unquestionably the worst incarnation of a franchise the league has ever seen.

Do Edmontonians not know how to read facial expressions or are they really just trying to convince themselves he wants to be there? He's a long ways from being a UFA. Just about the most shocking thing that could happen in the hockey world would be for McD to finish his entire contract without demanding a trade.

And the ""he could've signed for less"" argument is pretty weak when a guy that can't legally drink is looking at those dollar signs.

Prior to last year, I was the biggest hater of Leafs management and ownership and I still am not 100% sold on everything they're doing.  Ask anyone in /r/Leafs.  I still think drafting Marner over Hannifin was the biggest mistake and I was one of the biggest critics of the old regime.

"> The Oilers scouting department has been by far the worst in the NHL for most of the last decade so I don't think they had many players worth developing in that time.

Ohhhkay. Easy now. There's a lot of things to shit on the Oilers for, hell I can give you a top five. But ""not having players worth developing"" is not. People do end up forgetting that drafted Leon over Reinhart, Klefbom over a bunch of other duds in 2011 (mark mcneil, duncan siemens, stefan noeson, stuart percy etc), and we have done a great job with bringing up Nurse (he's playing amazing this year). 

Not only that since 2007, the first round has been Gagner, Alex Plante (dud), Riley Nash, Eberle (at 22nd!), Paajaarvi (debatable dud), Hall, RNH, Klefbom, Yak (dud), Nurse, Leon, McDavid, Puljujarvi, Yamamoto. Except for three they have all been competent NHL players. 

The only players we have really messed up with keeping in the NHL longer than they should've has been J Schultz (he should've not been given top min right off the bat), and Sam Gagner and Cogliano(we brought those guys up and kept them up way too long, although Gagner is still an effective player). Leon was hurt a bit by staying in the league in his first year for more than 10, but he's fine now. Same goes with Puljujarvi, who is finding his stride. 

Now the 2nd round. whew, that's where the Oilers have messed up. But saying that, we do have players worth developing right now in the system, but it's not as much as we want. "

I upvoted you because you are correct 
Seems to be a team out there that got 2 cups right after each other. That is more impressive. 
"If they were willing to do so, they would. 

Players might be willing to do that for 1 year or maybe 2 tops, post peak. When they know they wont be making the big bucks. 

But to say that lots would is not correct."
No.  Otherwise players would’ve gladly gone to Edmonton in the offseason after that playoff run last year. Take a year at a cheap salary and see how it goes
"Mmmm, maybe so, and yet Arizona has made it deeper into the playoffs than a fair few other teams in the past years, including Edmonton. Players also enjoy winning olympics and making lots of money, I hear."
Yeah I think what I read was in college he was more into partying than playing and then spent 3-4 years in the SPHL and ECHL trying to get his shit back together.
"The only NHL player you've drafted beyond the first round (aka the players you need to draft and develop for years in the AHL, or my point) since 2007 is Tobias Rieder and he doesn't even play for you anymore lol

It doesn't get any worse than that."
"Any and every offer sheet would be matched. He was going nowhere. He took the money he could get, and then he'll move onto somewhere he can win a Cup. Probably sooner than 8 years. More likely when he demands a trade in 3. "

This isn't a discussion. It's just you venting your pent up hate on the Oilers. Keep hating if it makes you feel better. But there are more constructive outlets you could find.
I didnt realize they gave out rings for making the playoffs. Talk to me when youve won something in the last 5 decades. 
"Any day? Matthews must be clouding your memory. Considering we've had a bit more playoff success than you since 2005 I'd say that's pretty funny coming from a Leafs fan. 
Some serious salt leftover from not getting McDavid on your team.

Since the lockout in 2004-2005, the Leafs have made the playoffs a grand total of twice, reaching the Conference Quarterfinals.

Meanwhile the Oilers have also made the playoffs twice and made it to the Stanley Cup Finals. 

You guys most likely making the playoffs this year doesn't suddenly give the last decade of Leafs hockey a pass."
"I have no issue with trolling from other fan bases about Edmonton being bad. Hell, it’s deserved for many reasons. But you and many other Leafs fans make it personal for whatever reason. You attack the fans and the city instead of the god awful management. 

And I’m not trying to generalize here. The vast majority of Leafs fans are great fans that are passionate about their team. But for whatever reason when McDavid comes up, there is some real toxic shit that gets thrown towards Oil fans and the city from some of you. "
"Sorry for your rough night but if you needlessly shit on a group of people, that group is not gonna be happy. "

"Your poor reading comprehension and fear of losing a generational player are combining to project desperation on an observation, pal. There hasn't been a single naysayer that didn't have a EDM tag. Those orange and blue glasses are making it so you can't see the writing on the wall. "
"Wow. I use SwiftKey to swipe and it put the wrong your/you're. I literally fixed it before you commented. Go ahead and find the extra comma you're trying to shove into there; though, as if you've won some moral victory over a typo. You clearly need it since you're not getting any W's on the ice. "
"I don't hate Edmonton. I'm quite indifferent to them. They're toiling at the bottom of the standings. All I said was he clearly doesn't want to be there and everyone from Edmonton took that as an insult to themselves. So keep raging if it makes you feel better. Everyone else in the league sees what you can't.

Outlet? Who said anything about seeking a constructive outlet? You're here too, putz. Learn from your team. Take the L and move on with your day. Or did I hit too close to home and now you have to make it about yourself?"

Then the Rangers advance to play Ottawa, and holy shit what a dream matchup. Karlsson vs Lundqvist? We're not even worthy of the amazing attractiveness.

It's awesome, he deserves it, he deserves the Cup. Toronto fans are upset, but hey, no one expected them to get this far, no hard feelings Rags. 

Over in the west, Edmonton beats San Jose and somehow convinces Bettman to let Joe Thornton play for them for the remainder of the playoffs. Nice! They faceoff against Anaheim and win a tough fought series in 6. Nashville has to face off against...wait, what's happening, could it be? YES! ITS A REVERSE SWEEP! YOUR MINNESOTA WILD ARE HEADED TO THE SEMI FINALS. Mike Yeo gets fired and the Blues hire Dan Bylsma. In the 2nd round, Bruce Boudreau pumps his team up so much that they only lose by 3 goals in a game 7 against Nashville. Edmonton then sweeps Nashville in 3 games. 

The Stanley Cup finals are epic. McDavid vs. Lundqvist. Kreider vs. Lucic. Larsson vs McDonough. Edmonton Gretzky vs. Rangers Gretzky. God it's such a great series. Every single game goes to triple overtime. Then it's finally game 7. Game 7 of the most amazing playoffs we have ever seen. The teams come out, the puck drops, and when the final buzzer sounds...yes...YES!!! *YES!*

"Well fuck, who'd thought that we see the Preds win the series, let alone Sweep the Blackhawks.

Preds, you played to your top notch and Rinne was on fucking fire this Series and it paid off. Rinne followed the school of Varly on how to beat the Blackhawks at their game and it paid off. Everyone was on all cylinders and I think we're going to see a blast from the past like the 2012 Kings. Whoever faces the Preds next is going to have their hands tied.

Blackhawks, you had an hell of an Season and even though it was a disappointing end to your season, you played your ass off and it was fucking amazing seeing you guys make a force in the West this season. The Blackhawks can't be overlooked next season as long as the core nucleus of Toews and Kane is intact. This season ended sooner than expected, but I see this as a bump on the road."

But maybe the team just isn't ready for the playoffs yet? With the media hounding them, the pressure of being considered the next ""Stanley Cup winner"", fuck I wouldn't be able to handle that shit. 

Maybe having them on the golf course for another month or two to develop a bit wouldn't have been a bad idea. The team is only 90. At 90 I will be a complete fucktard who will have no idea what I want to do.

 Not much will change... but I'd like to think I will have a bit of a better head on my shoulders then.

 I actually feel really bad for the Hawks, and I hope we don't ruin them.

**Edit:** I'm being lynched for ever daring to doubt the greatness of the Chicago Blackhawks. How dare I say such blasphmey after only FOUR games. You're right, they may only be 90 years old, but Toews has the emotional maturity of a Buddhist monk, and the intangibles and athleticism as a top olympic athlete. They may have won the draft lottery only 9 to 10 years ago, but they are a grown team now, capable of all pressure and criticism that comes their way.

I am but a lowly neckbeard maple leafs fan who lives in my mothers basement here to shit on them for not getting 50 goals in their first 4 games. I am a rodent, and Kane is a golden god.

"So this is now the 2nd highest rated post in r/hockey history?

ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS ARE BELONG TO US."
How sweet it is
"Obi Wan what is it?

It is as if I heard a million fans crying out as they fall off a bandwagon at once."
So as an amateur hockey fan (been to preds  games in person but don't watch religiously) is this akin to the Patriots getting shit stomped in the first round by the Bengals?
"Hi, /r/all here. I didn't even know Nashville had an NHL team!"
As a Bruins fan. This feels so amazing. Thank you Nashville. 
"Brings tear of joy to my eye

Fuck the Blowhawks"
"Hawks swept in the first round, Flames swept in the first round, Red Wings didn't make the playoffs for the first time in 25 years, this has been the best 1st round in my recollection"
Top of r\all now Shitcago is never going to live this one down BWAH HAHAHA

Now if only the Penguins can be knocked off next round it'll be a perfect bracket.

Now watch the Blues lose the next three to show everyone how to really fail in the playoffs!
Only 3 goals in 4 games. Unreal.
Thank you Nashville!
"Nashville did an amazing job against us. Outplayed us every single step of the way. Great job Preds, now go win the Stanley cup. "
Anyone know when the Chicago Blackhawks start their playoffs?
"Tonight, Smashville, we salute you"
"Holy shit, a sorta successful TN team? Yay my state did a thing"
"Can someone make a photoshop of the Forrest Gump black panther scene with the Preds logo over Tom Hanks' face and make it read ""sorry I ruined your Blackhawks party""? Thanks in advance. "
All this Chicago hate with no Nashville love. I FUCKING LOVE MY CITY AND MY TEAM. BEST IN THE NHL.
"Well, at least they didn't lose on my birthday this year...  But they still ended up losing on my moms birthday."
I'm just looking forward to tickets at the UC becoming more affordable in the coming seasons.
Congrats to Chicago on making history! 
this calls for some Chelsea Dagger
Blackhawks failed to win a game in the month of April.

Finally I see why the Flames reminded Brouwer of the Blackhawks.
YAY YAY YAY
Can't upvote hard enough.
As a Blues fan. Fuck the hawks
"Is this the end of the ""dynasty""?"
"All of the 14 year old band wagoners and white college girls who ""totes watch hockey"" are gonna be sooooo disappointed "
Also the first time in history an eighth seed has swept a first seed!
Thanks Preds. Fuck the Hawks.
"YES NASHVILLE! I'm so HAPPY going into my shift now! Let's keep it up for round two.

What a great series, Rinne you beast!"
"I can't wait for ESPN's analysts to start going ""This will really light a fire under the Blackhawks...I predict they'll win the Cup next season!"""
Well time to jump onto the wild bandwagon.  For at least one game...
"Holy shit, this is the top post of all time here now. I love this way too much. "
nobody is gonna see this but i secretly don't hate the blackhawks
FUCK YOU CHICAGO!^^yeah^I^know^we're^next
"It's horrible that the Kings shit the bed this year, but so far the playoffs are unfolding exactly as I hoped. Give me a Sharks exit and a Ducks exit and I'll be good. 

I wish there was a word, preferably in German, that could describe this emotion I'm feeling. "
"About time the Hawks had a long summer ;)

But seriously I hope we see a new cup winner  this year. Go Preds!"
Deep dish sucks too.
FUCK THE CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS!!!!!!
I just realized that the Kings and the Hawks have something in common this year. They both have 0 wins in the playoffs.

"Fade me motherfuckers. Cubs won the world series, this is the price we had to pay"
Still more cups than us! But now we both have brooms! 
8th seed sweeps a 1st seed.. wow
"So ummmm who else had Hawks-Jackets for their SCF?

Cause this silly cunt sure did..."
Pop the bubbly!
"Wow, fucking well done preds didn't think you guys could do it but I'm glad I'm wrong."
God damnit they were my cup pick 
My heart just feels so warm and cuddly.
I like it I love it!
LUL
Lavi is doing his thing. Good times ahead!
"Wooooooooo Hooooooooo!

Thank you Nashville!"
"Tip of the hat to the Preds, my Hawks did not show up to play this series. I don't understand how the series ended up being so lopsided, but it is what it is. Good luck to the Preds, but I'll be pulling for anyone but the Preds for the rest of the playoffs;)"
So this is what the Cubs did with thier curse.... They just gave it to the Blackhawks 
"Could one, theoretically, switch to a new bandwagon flair? Asking for a friend."
L
Kick Ass!
So surreal to see the Blackhawks get swept. Crazy.
Team CHAOS IS OUT WOOO
Beginning of the end of the only modern dynasty
"We negotiate the terms of surrender. 

I see Pekka Rinne smile. 

We escort their men out of nashville. 

They stagger home single file. 

Tens of thousands of fans flood the streets. 

There are screams and church bells ringing. 

And as our fallen foes retreat. 

I hear the drinking song they’re singing…
  

The world turned upside down. 
  
The world turned upside down."
Wearing this flair proudly.
Meanwhile the 8th seed Chicago Bulls are up 2-0 on the 1st seed Boston Celtics.
The sacrifice of the hawks will lead to the second coming of the Bulls. Jimmy is the messiah.
"SWEEP THOSE MOTHERFUCKING HAWKS FLAIRS!!!
"
Time to rebuild.
"This is good, no, this is great. Changes are going to come. Seabrook is going to be gone. Mike Kitchen is going to be gone. The Hawks are going to have a great offseason. Call me an optimist, but I don't care, the Hawks aren't done yet. Congrats Preds, don't get too cocky. You're not a superior city or anything. I'm gonna hibernate from r/hockey for about a month until the memes die. 

Edit: I don't know why I'm getting down voted for this? Yeah yeah fuck the Hawks whatever. But, am I not allowed to vent some frustration because my fucking team lost?

Edit2: Alright r/hockey, I get it now. Fuck the Hawks! Am I doing this right?"
Cubs still won the world series
"Fuck it, The cubs satisfied me for the next 10 years.

Maybe the bears will be good by then.

(I know the bears won't be good by then)"

They hate us cuz they ain't us.
FASE THEM NOW! FADE THEM NOW! 
wat how lmao
Heh. 
LUL
"I really don't know how the Hawks go forward without making some significant changes.  They need a reality check and need to come to grips that their long term deals are an albatross.  Toews, Kane, Keith, Seabrook, Hossa, Panarin between them scored two playoff goals in the series and made no reasonable contribution.  "
...sigh. Fade me. Go Sens I suppose.

Well, ill just have to take solace in the fact that they did better than Detroit. "
I am sad.

Hahahahahaha this is what I live for!
"Nice to see another team in the former champ with a lot of big contracts graveyard.  It's not too bad.

Nashville looked like the Kings buzzing through Vancouver in 2012.  Did it early, did it quickly, before anyone knew what happened.  They also might play the Blues in the 2nd round too."
"And the Celtics about to go down to the Bulls in the NBA, another 8th seed?

Something is being fixed."
"Congrats to the preds, I thought that last CRAAAAWFOOOOORD and ""you suck, it's all your fault"" was a bit much when up 3-0 in the series and then 3-0 in the game. Not a good look Nashville."

Good job Nashville you guys played great. The better team doesnt always win and thats fine. The hawks still have a few more years to be contenders for the cup. A different mathup vs a team that dosnt have an amazing series and things could have been different. Thats the playoffs though you never know what can happen. The hawks hit a slump at the wrong time ontop of great play by Nashville.

"This was in no way a stellar Hawks team. They got hot at the end of the season and got first. People assume that ment a deep playoff run, but this wasnt an elite team the preds beat at all, Chicago had no buisness being in the playoffs, no massive win for preds since this Chicago team sucked, anyone would have swept them.

That's also how many goals Tom Wilson has scored
As did the Caps yesterday
We scored 3 in a period tonight
They're behind Jake Guentzel as a team
Tom Wilson has scored as many goals vs. The Leafs as the entire Blackhawks team.
Those 3 goals are 1 more than we put up against Rask in 2013.
Holy shit they literally didn't even score enough goals to win the series even if they had shut out all 4 games
washington on monday too... *starts crying*
Same with the Capitals
And only one of those was at even strength.
We scored that many in the third alone.

Truly a team that will go down in history. 
I'm reading it's the first such occurrence in professional sports history.
Technically it happened first in 1993 with the Blues sweeping the Hawks. It was a match up between the regular season winner of the Campbell Conference and the team who had the lowest points.

I'm a Cubs fan who fell in love with hockey thanks to the Preds. I'm totally fine with this.

I'll allow it.
"What if they're actually the sacrifice required for the Bulls to go on a magical Cinderella run to the NBA finals.

Especially when they occur in only two of the games
I did a bit of research and have concluded that 3 goals in 4 games can yield a maximum of 3 wins in the playoffs.
Can someone who knows advanced stats confirm this?
They were saving their goals for the second round
"Their playoff slogan was ""One Goal""...so they actually overachieved."
How many intangiables per 60 was that though?  10.5 million worth I hope.
It's very difficult to win 4 games with just 3 goals.
Big if true
To put it into comparison the penguins scored 16 goals over 5 games to win the series 3-1.
crazy
Can't go 120+ minutes of scoreless playoff hockey. Just won't cut it.

Makes season feel a little better man.
They finished with the same number of playoff wins as the Red Wings *minus* the Avalanche this season. 
haha oh shit
If you hadn't kept up with the season this year this would sound incredibly impressive 
And the same amount of bowl season wins as the entire state of Michigan!
If this was the late 90s early 2000s I'd be happy rn
Also the Flames
Combined! ... sobs

"The Hawks played pretty bad I mean...3 goals in 4 games is awful

But yes Nashville also kicked ass. So it's a little of both, but mostly the Preds and Rinne playing so good"
"Its a bit of both really. The hawks looked horrible from the start. They couldnt make a pass they kept wiffing on shots and couldnt even hit the net. Their fundamentals werent even there. They played like they didn't care and nashville came out with urgency and took advantage on the hawks playing like complete garbage. Ontop of playing like garbage there were no lucky breaks or weird bounces that went their way that could change the momentum of the game. We hit more posts then goals.  
 Game 2  at the start the hawks looked normal then first goal we had a perfect diving blocked shot and it goes bounces straight back to a wide open Nashville defenseman for a goal. Lucky breaks like that change games and change series. When the hawks won their cups they had alot of lucky breaks and bounces go their way. This series nashville had them  all it seemed.  
Not taking anything away from Nashville they played great as a team but little stuff like that makes a huge diffrence. 
"
"Its both.  You don't sweep the 1 seed without being good, and you don't GET swept by the 8th seed by playing competitively. "
"The Hawks played bad with 0 ability to connect passes , something they can do exceptionally well. While you guys played good hockey. Fact of the matter is the Hawks played bad and that's what cost them the series "
there's just so much going on in it!
do you push yourself forward with the broom like an oar?
If it persists see a doctor. 
"Seriously, I like to think that bad United mojo was part of the reason why they lost both games at home. "
Hope to see you next round
It's an /r/hockey tradition. You get an upside-down broom if you're reverse swept

"In football terms this would be the Patriots getting destroyed by the Titans in the first round... four games in a row. With the Patriots only scoring 3 field goals in all 4 games combined.

"A little of both I think, in addition to solid strategy by Lavi. I think the biggest factor was winning the neutral ice battles, the speed of our D corps, and forcing CHI to dump and chase. Still, it has to be underwhelming to get the performance you did out of your top guys. Still...always got nervous when Kane touched the puck."
Ready or not!
"No way. We definitely got outplayed. And fuck the neutral zone trap. 

Our team didn't show up. We sucked in so many ways. Had no puck luck either while the preds did. 

Taking all the calls, the lucky bounces, the goals on ourselves, our giveaways, etc. Take all of that into account and we still lose this series for sure. "

Combo of both. Preds looks really good though
Real fans are not stunned. The Hawks just were not that good of a team overall. I hated that I thought the Preds would win the series but I had them taking it in 5 or maybe 6. They looked awful going into the playoffs and played worse once they got there. Preds were definitely the better team this year
"Thankfully I knew it was over after game 2 but remained hopeful. 

Bandwagon fans are stunned and already screaming ""fuck the Hawks"" as if they're owed something. 

Whatever. I'll be selfish and just focus on the fact that I'll soon be that much closer to season tickets. "

"Kind of, but four games in a row instead of just one."
It's like the Patriots losing 3-24 to the Detroit Lions in the first round when many had the Patriots as likely to win the Super Bowl(assuming they played in the first round. Yeah I know they play in different conferences just work with me). The Predators are a talented team but I did not see them beating the Hawks much less winning in a sweep. 
Good one!
We take our hockey **REALLY** serious in Nashville. We have a pretty huge fanbase.
Find highlights from tonight and just listen to the crowd
17 seconds
"Me too fellow redwing, me too"
i'd be interested in watching that!
All I want to see is the graph that shows bandwagon flairs and the jump it'll have for your team
"I don't think you understand, everyone is a Preds fan tonight! I'm a Wild fan, but you guys earned a curious follower and fan tonight. Huge upset, great hockey, beat the team other than the Kings that people hate the most, etc. Good times!"
You got some unlucky birthdays in your family bud
"I'm looking for Blackhawks games to be affordable everywhere, every stadium price gouges them! Even Carolina!"
"The day Toews and Kane got their 10.5 million cap hit, I said they would never win again. Too much cap going to two players and they won't get the depth needed to fill out the lineup in the past. 

Most of the cups the Hawks won was when the team had some of the best depth in the league. I don't see that happening again... "
"That's really dependent on Toews' and Kane's time on the team. When they're gone, this era is pretty much over. "
"nah, it's cubs time for them now."
Hey man nothing wrong with white college girls
"what about the Rags though?  man, the Habs gotta beat them and fuck up Kreider and Zuks while they're at it.  please."
they already are.
Reverse sweep will be beautiful
Dallas scoreboard is still number 1.

You son of a bitch
I see you...I don't hate them either.  I'm married to a Chicago fan.
Anything can happen in the playoffs friendo 
"Hawks fan. I agree. And fuck the Cubs. And fuck the Bulls. And fuck the Bears. And hot dogs are overrated. Put ketchup on them if you want. 

Still... Go Hawks. "

Meh. Get better material son.

I'd rather be in Russian than play for the Canucks.
Wait until tomorrow if the Bruins get knocked out.
There's two not Black Hawk teams you don't hate or is it Nashville and your own team?
Your fucked bud that shit is seated on your team forever now only future success will wash it off.  Beyond that just escape from hockey or hockey news for a while
"So much happened. I can't even type it all since I'm mobile. 

Our team didn't show up. Only Crawford. And I'm surprised he did so well. If it wasn't for some lucky bounces, ass passes/goals, hidden pucks and crow accidentally scoring on himself.., we still would have lost because we were outplayed but holy fuck Crawford put up a fight. 

Toews and Kane should donate $1mil each to him. "
You might come back in our series...it's a definite maybe.

"And who do you expect to take on Seabrook?

That contract is one of the biggest and longest grenades in the league"
Don't forget it's not a regular offseason. There is a supplemental draft coming up as well. 
"Oh look, a reasonable response in this thread."
"No, actually. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but after witnessing how devastating this sweep was the MLB has decided to retroactively reverse the 2016 WS result and awarded the game 7 victory to Cleveland. "

That's pretty disturbing bro

They put the Nashville Predators in for Artem Anisimovs name? I don't get it?
"But every single time the Hawks stumble in the regular season, all this sub hears is ""doesn't matter, they'll step up in the playoffs like they always do.""

This was not stepping up in the playoffs.

This wasn't luck.

This was a series where, for 11 of 12 periods played, the Hawks had no answer for what the Preds were doing. They were outplayed back to front."
"The better team doesn't always win, but they definitely don't get destroyed 4 games in a row. I think we know who the better team actually was in this series."

Holy shit man talk about salt LMAO

Yeah it wasnt a great Hawks team this year but the Preds played much better overall. Rinne was great and their D was great. Credit where credit is due
"After the first game of the season I asked my buddy if he could find odds on the Blackhawks Not making the playoffs. I just didn't think they looked good. Obviously they turned it around, but they seemed to be the team they looked like in game 1"

I'm guessing he's drumming. On his pubic bone.
"The Preds do a military salute on the jumbotron during the second period to recognize a military member in the crowd, and everyone stands up and applauds."

Why? I mean we won it in 2005? The Cubs have been near the top in profit for a long time. They could have bought a team whenever they wanted to. 
12 years is a significantly less painful drought to deal with than 108.
Somehow that got more ridiculous after the Bears

"The Hawks fans must be feeling waaaay worse than Flames fans though :/ We got in on a wild card spot, and still aren't in a cup window. We were making the 2nd round at best. The Hawks are still trying to hang on to a cup window. Getting swept in the first round by the 8th seed is definitely much worse than our situation."

It's the only funny post I've seen on this thread.
Lmao such a sneaky way to have almost identical looking hawks flair without being faded. Or have you had Portland for a while?
"It was a mix of bad play, bad luck, inexperienced players, slowness, just so many things. Crow scored a goal on himself last night - I think that really confirmed the bad luck and put the final nail in the coffin. Anisimov had a great scoring opportunity but was fucking lumbering after the puck so wasn't able to convert. He was probably not close to 100% after his injury or just was gassed after a long shift, but either way they just sucked. Some of it was bad luck, but most of it was the play. I mean shit, Nashville had some bad luck too with pucks going off the posts or crossbar and whatnot, but they still showed up. 

I love you, Hawks, but damn. 

Now it's just a question of who I'm rooting for the rest of the way.... I'd like to see Ovie hoist the cup but also have a soft spot for the Leafs and Matthews. Assuming either of them can get past the Penguins. Ah fuck it. At least the other series have been fun to watch. It's been depressing watching the Hawks go out like that. "

"So, without getting too wordy here... Seed basically refers to how well you did in the regular season. Blackhawks had the best regular season in the conference and we were the lowest team to make make it to the playoffs (wildcard)... so in the playoffs, they reward the team that had the best season, the 1 seed, by having them play the lowest team in the playoffs, the 8 seed. The 1 seed is, in theory, the best position to have in playoffs, and the 8 seed is the worst.

Note that this takes place in each conference, so there are actually two 8 seeds and two 1 seeds. The conferences are like the AFC and NFC in football. So in a bracket, [the two sides](http://i.imgur.com/AKxbdmV.png) battle it out and the winners of each side play each other for the final championship. 

I have no fucking idea why they actually use the word ""seed""."

Probably has something to do with Subban being on the team that swept them. I'd assume that anyways.
They did only have one even-strength goal!
"I do think they played uncharacteristically bad, however a lot of people are viewing this as a choke by Chicago. That we were an easy series and that they are shit for getting swept by us.

I know not everyone thought that, but a lot of people (specifically Chicago fans) are quick to say shit like, ""How the hell do you lose to Trashville"" when in reality....we aren't some awful team. "
Valid point; if the puck doesn't bounce your way you're dead meat. Last night we had  million great chances in OT; the game-winner came off a deflected pass...
"Further prove my point. Your whole roster doesn't suddenly lose the talent that they have had for years. Even players that are old and declining don't regress in a single series. 

A team can play ""bad"" for a game. Even then, that usually is contributed to tons of factors like travel, time between games, injuries, physicality of previous games, crowd noise, etc.

A number one seed doesn't get swept by just playing bad and the other team playing good. You guys were blatantly outcoached and severely underestimated our capabilities. Q should honestly be fucking embarrassed."
Of course I hope we slaughter Minnie as well... but honestly going up against the Preds is scary to me.

First time in the playoffs in a long time and you get a little cocky. Cheeky boy
They were defiantly outplayed this series for sure. They never got the early momentum goal that could have changed things.  Ontop of Nashville playing very well they also had alot of things go their way.  Thats how the playoffs are who gets the breaks that change give the momentum and whos hot at the time.
Well yea they looked horrible in these game. Couldn't make passes and wiffing shots. They ended with an 8 game losing streak. They slumped and did nothing about it and nashville played great ontop of it. The wild had a hard ending to their regular season and it also carries over to the playoffs it seemed. It happens. The best team and tops seeds dont always win. A lot of the playoffs depend on whos hot and which team gets the bounces.

You also told the hobey baker winner two years ago you wouldn't sign him because he is too small and wouldn't amount to anything... As long as Sakic is making your calls you don't have a leg to stand on
Hey fuck you guy
Holy shit what is the context of this?
Still don't think that there will ever be a time I won't upvote this.
It's even funnier the second time 
This deserves WAY more than 8 upvotes!
Chicago will forget they have a hockey team in a few years like they did a decade ago.
"Eh, these ones will be dead by then"
Joke's on them... in 100 years there won't be any ice left on the planet so they'll never ever win again.
I'll be alright if it's the Bulls this year. Full circle
Ill worry about that in sobriety

Remind you!
"Hey man, we're not all bad. "
I read it as former blackhawks fan. Thought it was a great chirp about all the bandwagon fans
Everyone hates winners. We love a good underdog.
I never thought of it that way... ALL HAIL THE HYPNOROMO
IT'S THE CIRRRRCLLLLEEE OF LIIIIIFFFFEEEEE
I'm happy with that outcome. 
Thank. God.
"I don't think it is cosmically allowed to ever be ""The Lions' year"""

He survived Alabama defenses with only a *mississippi state* O line to protect him. He's not fragile 
"Trust me, I'm not a Cowboys fan either so it just sucked for us too. If it makes you feel better, the Mavs also died for the Cowboys' sins. "
"Hey, he finished a season without breaking his back or shoulder, that's more than Romo's done in years"
"Hey, he made it through one season at least. "
Hell yeah. I'm a Cubs fan too. Good man.
james dolan could have a video of him doing a sterling like rant for 20 minutes and the league couldn't remove him cause he owns the arena
Oh i misread that then. My bad. 
"Add in that all our games we were within 1, and I think I am at solace."
"It's pretty much worst case scenario. What's the moral victory here? ""At least we didn't get shut out *every* game?""?"
"It's not even a slow closing window. It's that sticky window you have to put some effort into and once it releases, it's down in a fraction of a second"
"I can't speak for anybody else, but I think the Blackhawks ran into the wrong team at the wrong time, and the idea of having a meltdown about what happened seems awfully silly seeing as I have three different ""Chicago Blackhawks Stanley Cup Champion"" license plate frames with three different years on them. 

It sucks, the salary cap sucks, I enjoyed every minute of the last decade of Blackhawks hockey and that isn't about to change.

That being said, I'm unsubbing from /r/hockey until next season starts. "
But we have three cups to catch our tears. I'd still rather be in my situation than yours.
"To be fair, Nashville isn't exactly a ""let's hope we make it past the first round"" team either."
Hawks fan. Too drunk to care right now.
100% can confirm
"It's funny you mention that. I basically checked out of the playoffs after the first game, which is unfortunate. Was fun watching the spectacular goaltending though."
We don't really want to talk about it okay?
"Do fans really consider teams being in a ""cup window"" and what not? Seems a bit of a pessimistic way of thinking about things. I think you can always have a chance to get to the cup if you've made the playoffs. Just need the right mojo to bring you through"
Nah it sucked but we've got lots of young talent.  
Don't cry for us. I thought the window was closed in 2011 and after game 3 of the 2013 Cup Final. I'm still looking forward to a lot of great hockey this postseason.
At least the Hawks didn't blow a 4-1 lead
Meh- still got our three rings.
"When is your window? In 2018-19 when you clear Backlund, Stajan, and Bouma? You own Mark Giordano until he's 38 years old. Johnny Hockey is at the age where his player type peaks. I think you guys are in your window."
broom buddies!!
"I wouldnt. 

They deserve the broom, not you. Calgary played much better than it looks."
Haha i fucking love that the faded flairs have brooms
Swept Sisters
I am so happy that I decided to check this sub on my desktop instead of mobile. I never knew the brooms were a thing. 
Why didn't we tank for Chicago??!
What? Head Coach Pierre McGuire doesn't have a good ring to it?
Oh but he's the perfect fit! Says my news app... Bahahaha
"He would rule with an iron fist and no sense of personal space. It would be a reign of intimidation and, a phrase historians would one day coin, ""ewwgrossness."" "
"This should be the pens right now man, you were supposed to be the ""team that was finally good and taking people by surprise despite the fact that everyone should have known you had great potential the entire time"" team right now."
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! <3 
"Lol it's not the Oilers fans fault. Just because you guys aren't the underdog anymore, and no one is talking about how ""hard working"" and ""likeable"" your team is, doesn't you're hated. Every team deals with trolls. "
"If we lose, we'll be too drunk and miserable to yell at management."
C'mon at least [link it right](http://i.imgur.com/cHAdxXv.png)
"That's been the motto for at least 8 years!!! 

Pretty impressive it took until now to kick us in the ass!"

"Who cares! 

I'm more pumped it's not a ""GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES NEW SYMBOL FOR CHOKING"" meme"
"Further clarification for the r/all crowd: The Blackhawks scored a total of 3 goals in 4 games. Needless to say, the end result wasn't pretty."
"Ohhh okay, that's pretty funny, thanks!"
"FUCKIN RIGHT WE DIDN'T GET SWEPT! IN FACT I HOPE THEY DESIGN A ""REVERSE SWEEP"" FLAIR FOR THE BLUES, I GOT A FEELIN' THEY'RE GONNA NEED IT."
"""a"" goal? 

just keep piling it on."
"If mean, you could win in three shutouts"
"If mean, you could win in three shutouts"
I feel like they'd still award a goal? Just because I don't think they ever let games end tied. 
Left as an exercise to the reader.
The best kind of technically correct
Yes. It's amazing.
"It's a real, beautiful thing"
This is the best thing I've seen all day.
Why not both?
It looks like a knife if you see the handle as a blade. 
Lol I live in Michigan so I do understand. My friends who are Wings fans sent me plenty of texts. 
"Honest answer -- I don't understand why Nashville winning the series was seen as such an impossibility (A sweep sure, that's inconceivable). They were red hot entering the playoffs (for the old school guys), they had better possession numbers (for the new school guys). On top of that, they have two defencemen who can give you over 25 quality minutes a game. "
They went in pretty hot and I think people really underestimated them.

Thats right I gotta make this a cs sound thing still
How many of those 360k views are from /r/hockey?
Saving this for fantasy shit talk
"outstanding. sending this to everyone i know.

edit: and yes, i'm fucking salty today."
"I'm not really salty.  The refs were pretty shit with the calls but they let both teams get away with just sitting on guys, and the second preds goal in game 3 was interference, but this team didn't show up at all.  Preds played well and Chicago just handed them the games.  Low effort, shitty rushed passing, just all around bad lazy play."
"naw, thats still calgary"
"Wow, it's all or nothing then."
This is the one I can approve of. Go get em Ducks. Let the liquor be your guide. 
Not being sneaky. I've had Portland flair the entire time. I usually bandwagon the Blackhawks because half my family is in the Chicago area.
"I remember rocking Portland for the first time back in 2014, trying to hide the shame"
"It's been Winterhawks since I subscribed to this sub. 

No shit? We also knocked out a favorite in the first round. Sounds familiar. "

I love seeing Brock Lobster get shit
"Ive only managed a few nice goals off of one-timers, usually on relatively slower passes, but trust me it feels fucking awesome when you get good wood on it and put it top shelf. Might not get any points for style, but it still feels way better than stopping it before shooting"

"it's older than the current color scheme, and i am not skilled in the ways of photoshop. "

Damnit Nashville, just when I thought I could hate you, you say things like that and give me Hot Chicken and it makes it impossible for me to hate you."
I laughed so hard at this I woke up my roommate

Yep!  I have Nashville all the way to the finals 
"Yeah I called Preds in 7 so the sweep is a bit surprising. But the preds had way too many injuries and 3v3/SO losses for me to put much weight in their regular season record, and Chicago had some unsustainable underlying numbers. "
"Wild Caps baby! Based entirely on the tried and true method of ""I want the team who hasn't ever won a cup yet that isn't my team to win."" method! "

That's wonderful! I had no idea this existed.

As a die hard hawks fan... Fuck that. You're more salty than the Dead Sea. Show some respect you add bag.
Ah yeah you're right. Kane had 2 as well
it was more a joke about the prevailing narrative that the only reason Toews doesn't win the Art Ross every year is because he chooses to focus on his two way game.

"I'm down voting because you have a SJS bandwagon tag... I don't know how to throw a tag on, but no way I would ever put anything but the hawks."
"Yeah by no means are you guys trash at all. Plus Rinne activated beast mode.

But a choke's a choke. If the Sharks get called chokers for losing to \#8 seed Anaheim in 2009 then the Hawks are chokers here too.

But all that matters is you guys are in round 2 and the Hawks are not. So enjoy it"

"That team that lost was also the Chicago Blackhawks, and they've won 3 Stanley cups in recent times, so they are generally hated by most, especially people in their conference, and more importantly their division.

The only strike that happened was in '92.
"Yep, can do more damage on the inside"
"Yes, very. At first I did not want him hired, but he said everything I wanted to hear at that press conference. One thing to say it, another to do it, but I think this team needs more discipline and structure than Ruff was able to give it. I also love that he wants to make Seguin into a true ""all situations"" 1C and is going to make Jamie step up his leadership, which I think the team needs (especially with so many young players). 

If nothing else I will be optimistic because he's hired and nothing we can do to change that, and after this last season I want to be happy when I think about the Stars again :)"
"Haha, oh snowflake, you sad still?"
10 years ago the Blackhawks weren't even broadcasted. I'm only a fan because of the Ice hogs but I'm sure there are plenty of fans that certainly don't deserve to be called banwagonors in that area
I'm not embarrassed.  Nice try though. 
"I guess when no one expects anything of you, and you have nothing to lose, that can be a dangerous combo."
Yea it's annoying. I've been a die hard Kings fan for as long as I can remember. I've followed them my whole life watching games with my dad.
fuckin bandwagoners.
The real test is the missing the playoffs.  You keep coming after that your an official diehard and you get a special badge

But we had high attendence in every decade outside of Wirtz?

That is amazing. I found the website and tried to buy it but they're sold out. Once it's back I'm grabbing it.

Yeah but that was never the question

Did you predict the final series to have a total of 3 goals scored in it or am I missing something?

Well there's your first problem. Everyone knows believing in miracles is only for American hockey teams.

"ELOE for teams that have won a lot.  Your forgetting that Montreal, Toronto and Detroit have more Stanley Cup wins then any of the teams you have listed.  Montreal more than any team you listed combined.  If it weren't for the bears total win loss record, I wouldn't be surprised if they get booted out of the ELOE for their one SB victory.

The seeding back then was more similar to the current format than the 1-8 format. It just took the top 4 from each division instead of top 3 plus wild cards.

You guys still have more talent then 90% of the league. I would bet money that you guys win 50 games again next year. Shit, I wouldn't bet money that we could be you again next year. I think that in this series though, we played better than expected and you guys just couldn't match the tempo."

"Youre literally talking to a fanbase whos team traded Hasek the GOAT goalie just for shits and giggles. Also the is difference your team literally won in 1990 after the Gretzky trade, while for us our franchise sunk to the bottom after 92 where our ownership traded the cornerstones of our team for cheap replacements. Roenick, Larmar, Chelios, Belfour, Hasek and anyone else even remotely relavant to our team was traded for utter crap. Oilers fans were spoiled having the Goat play for them. 

Since I assume youre young, imagine the Oilers make the finals with McJesus, just to trade him, Draisaitl, and everyone else skilled on the oilers just for older players literally in order to spend less. We literally couldnt even watch our team on tv because of our owner when I was growing up, you have no idea what that is like. Even then the Oil had a run to the damn finals let alone a cup post Gretzky. That 06 run alone gives you more bragging righst than the entire country outside of the Nucks and the sens (07) and my god it was more to write home about than our team after 92."
"Wasnt trying to shit on you guys (since you gave the K response) but the Hawks had an owner who literally wouldnt of gave a shit if the team relocated, there is a reason why Dollar Bill's moment of silence in the 08 season was met with boos. He literally did his best to kill hockey in Chicago.It really is so tough to even explain this to the average r/hockey poster. As a kid born in 95 the Hawks were the one team I could never even see growing up. They made the finals (against the shitty side of Pennsylvania) 3 years before I was born. Already having parents from the U.K region the Hockey was already unknown to my family as it was. It wasnt until that somewhat corny (but still really fucking great) movie miracle came out that I started taking an interest in the league even then, to watch the Hawks people in Chicago would of had to pay another $50+ to watch every Hawks game on tv. Assuming you watch Basketball imagine today if the 76'ers made you pay $100+ (even more when you factor the value of a dollar) every year to watch them  tank and be godawful, that basically was the Hawks from the 90's until he died."

You know the Blackhawks have as many Stanley Cups in the last 8 years as they had goals in this current run? 
"Wouldn't really go down that road, given that the Hawks only had 3 cups in their first 84 years, inducing a 49-year drought. 

Hell, you could expand that to Chicago and their 5 major sports teams:

- Cubs with 3 championships in 141 years, including a 108 year drought.
- Sox with 3 championships in 116 years, including an 88 year drought. 
- Bears with 1 championship in 50 years of Super Bowl era, and in a 32 year drought.
- Bulls did alright with 6 championships in 51 years, but all within 7 years, and are in a 19 year drought. 

That's a combined 19 wins from 442 attempts.

Given that San Jose only has one team in the four major sports, and has no titles but one finals appearance in 25 years, and made the playoffs 20 of 26 seasons, that doesn't look too bad.

They still have another 416 years to win 19 cups. Of course, in the last 124 years only the Habs have more than 13."

People don't generally like fans of a dynasty. That's generally why I assumed people don't like the blackhawks fans. Same with the patriots and the cavs . And if winning have the cups for half a decade isn't one I don't know what is. A dynasty doesn't win every year none ever will.

The Canadiens(They have been a dynasty for a total of 3 times) did 6 in 8 years in '52-'60 and 4 in 5 in '64-'6. 

Generally you want to be 4 in 5 years or 4 in 6 years/max loss of 2 but when it comes to 5 years max loss of 1..

Now if you had been considered a dynasty before your 3 win, then this time round you may have been considered a dynasty(happened to Montreal), but you didn't. You won 3 in 5 years, weren't a regular real contender in those 5 years and got swept this year, thus proving why you shouldn't be considered a dynasty. "
A cup two years later? Finals the year after that? 
Won more cups than the sharks have?
"And what more did you really accomplish by making them only to be swept in the first round? We're in the same boat now. 
Edited my comment bc I realised my error we are not a dynasty and after this series, neither are you. "
What is the sound a Blackhawk makes on the way out of the playoffs?
How many suns do we really need?

You're thinking the Star. That's the respectable one (though far from perfect).  
"Yea, and he later died a disgraced, cancer ridden man. "
"Of course he does.  The Greater Toronto Area has 6.5 million people and half of them are complete dipshits who love reading take down pieces on our teams best players because if it was phil kessel's fault its an easy fix,  if its the fact that phil kessel can only make everyone on his line better,  and not every line on the team then its a lot harder."
Either today or yesterday he was acting all high and mighty to people on Twitter too because he gets to sit in the pressbox and is a reporter so he's obviously better/more knowledgeable than the plebs in the stands.
Steve Simmons still has a job to meet his employers quota of staff with special needs

Hmm not a bad idea.

Let me guess, you also outplayed us the previous 29 times we've beaten you consecutively."

I mean u right they aren't now but u look at the east no way they don't make the finals every year till lebron retires 
Lol u have a formula for what you consider a dynasty... what you need is a life.

Well apparently all you had to do was trade him to get into the playoffs. There were no other factors present at all.
You guys are tied going into game 5 in the first round. You're pretty far off.
At least as many times as is required to be named such...
I'm sorry 🐋 friend 😞
And in our rewatch of Mighty Ducks 🙏🏼
"I'm a simple guy, I see a dickens quote I try to finish it"
you Flames guys are alright
">2 5v5 goals to 10.

Yes I already addressed that. Gibson was good and Flames had low PDO

>The refs handed you the series and you choked on their outstretched arms.

The Flames had  more PIMs than the Ducks.

>0 heart, 0 discipline, 0 offense.

The play was in the Ducks end more than it was in the Flames end.

It's actually shocking how many Ducks fans don't even know what happened in the series lmao."
"At least my existence is based on sticking with teams throughout their miserable history, instead of saying ""I have family in Chicago, go Blackhawks/Cubs/Bulls"" whenever those teams are on an upturn. The bulk of your fan base will move on when it's no longer fulfilling to post your team's success (or lack thereof) on their Facebook page. How's that for pathetic?"
I can get behind that. 
Rude!
Reds fan here. Fuck the Cards!!
"Yeah, I think the Packers burned up Milwaukee's sports luck. Here's hoping I'll be that Brewers fan like the Cubs fan down the hall from my office.

""Hawks are about to get swept...but I don't give a shit. Cubs won the world series"". "
*Angrily upvotes* 
*Drops Mic*
Weak
When was the last time the canucks won the cup?
And the Rangers from 1940-1994. 
They are ripe to be beaten this year. And even if they do make the finals... man they are going to get whooped by whoever comes out of the West.
It's wikipedia dumbshit lmao
so its really more like Phil Kessel Locker Room Cancer.
"Wrong, you forgot the pylon.

""Phaneuf is enough"". I was going to print them on tshirts and hawk them outside of the ACC until it shamed him into leaving or going back to Phaneuf circa Calgary Flames days. His trade cost me fortunes. "
"Keeping Edmonton from getting the #1 overall draft, Winnipeg getting the #2 draft pick kept Edmonton from getting either Matthew or Laine.

Without those factors we wouldn't have been able to beat Edmonton twice this year, getting those necessary points to enter the playoffs. :]"
The Kessel trade isn't what got us in the playoffs
I'm not talking about this season.
"The quack attack is back jack

I wish they'd make a mighty ducks 4

They could call it ""beer league"" and make it pg13 or even r.

Disney's The Mighty Ducks 4: Sponsored by MillerCoors"
"We fuckin' party, and you're Nashville. It can work. I love PK, too."
It's shocking how far Calgary fans have their heads up their own asses. Ducks are the 3rd best 5v5 team in the league. Calgary is like 17. All your 3v3 means nothing in regards to actual hockey.
I was born in Chicago. Clearly I have no reason to root for teams there. 
❤️
Its weird that a St Louis flair is behind that 
I know! It should have an exclamation point not a question mark.
(Insert joke about how Chicago's offense was weak here)
"I think it's more like we added a solid goalie, a 40 goal player, two 60 point players, a 20 goal player, a 35 point defender, and some solid depth guys, all while continuing to get steady production out of the players that we kept..."
IDK he seems to get along with the guys in the burgh pretty well.
Feels like every week the standard for putting /s on a comment gets lower.
Take a good hard look at the team you're playing before you think having talent will guarantee a cup.
"The plot has to be something like Dodgeball. Coach Bombay owes a ton of money to the bank on his ice facility and the big bad business men (who happen to be hockey players) want the property to develop. Coach Bombay puts the facility as the wager and Charlie's mom hears about it and starts calling all the kids(who at this point live around the country) to drop their lives and come back home to play. 

Don't worry, it's already in production at Disney with a 2019 release date. "
I'd watch it
"> It's shocking how far Calgary fans have their heads up their own asses

Umm nope.

>Ducks are the 3rd best 5v5 team in the league.

Maybe during the regular season. The Flames easily outplayed the Ducks 5v5 during the series.

I'll repeat:

It's actually shocking how many Ducks fans don't even know what happened in the series lmao."
"""The bulk of your fanbase"""
"Haha, yeah. Originally from Milwaukee and moved to Mid Missouri"
I think that all went without saying considering how obviously it was sarcasm.  
It was a joke.  see my earlier post about why I think Kessel was maligned by the media in toronto.
"Well, when youre winning everything is easier."
Jesus did I ever misread that. 
"Trust me, it was thickly applied. You did nothing wrong. Good little funny."
"I was really trying not to say it because caps fans have been through enough.

Arguably the best pure goal scorer in history and he might not get a cup."
you know what? that actually sounds good. it's a modern day Ducks/Slap Shot combination vehicle...
"10 5v5 goals to 2. You're fucking retarded. Let me guess, you also outplayed us the previous 29 times we've beaten you consecutively."

"LOL I don't think I've seen a more blindly-homer idiotic comment history than yours.

wow it's... it's the most beautiful thing I have ever seen..

Hey it's my sisters dogs best friend Alex Pietrangelo 
"Wow, that's breathtaking. Literally never seen anything like it "
"Yo,  what Camera did you use? It's a little grainy, but the shot lines up perfectly"
The 120 degree heat must have melted the image.

I see many Stanley Cups being hoisted in that arena! 
NEEDS MORE JPG
Way nicer looking then the Preds new jersey
"Wow, I can't believe John Cena showed up."
"Yeah, this is photoshopped."
The season can't come soon enough.
You should blur out the faces.

Why would the mods remove it? It was one of the best views we've ever seen in some time. History books would probably publish this if it were available still because of the raw nature of the shot. Sad.

So my cousin just text me excitedly that his post made it to the top of r/all. I made sure he understood that at this point he can never share the real picture with another soul. But...that was after I had him send me a copy. Muahahahahah. I've never had so much power on reddit before...I think I got a little erection.

"My heart hurts a tiny bit. I became a Wings fan in 94, when I was 10 years old. I only BECAME a Wings fan because my grandpa was a sports collector, he'd make us grand kids go with him to signings, and get extra things signed for him. The rest is history so they say. 

During that time I met some of the most amazing people to ever play on the Red Wings. 

Yzerman, Lidstrom, McCarty, Draper, Maltby, The Russian Five, Shanahan, Robitaille, Hull, Datsyuk, Zetterberg, Holmstrom, Hasek.

I mean I can't even keep going because it would get to long. I'm glad that we could give certain players a chance to get a cup when they thought they never would get one (Sorry Alfie) 

I love this organization so much, and I love hockey. I'll continue to watch hockey, and especially the playoffs, even without my precious Wings. 

This will be better from them in the long run...a few years, perhaps?

"25 years, 4 Stanley Cups, numerous hall of famers, many players spending their whole careers with us, revitilizing Detroit and hockey in Michigan. Too many people to thank for 25 great years, the Ilitches; Scotty Bowman, Babcock, and all the other coaches along the line who helped us stay consistently in the playoffs; All of the players who gave their everything to this team and city; all the personnel who keep the team running. Thanks for everything. 

Now let's begin the rebuild so we can start another dynasty"

Hey /u/intothewild520,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts."
"For the first time in the history of /r/hockey for that matter, and in the history of reddit, and...."
And the Lions haven't won a playoff game in 25 years. Coincidence? I think not. 
"This will be the first time in my life that the playoffs won't have Detroit in them. 

This just feels wrong. So so wrong. "
"The last time Detroit missed the playoffs, Chris Farley and Phil Hartman were still on SNL."
"Goodnight, sweet prince."
"Yeah, playoffs without the Wings is kinda weird...."
It's strangely a relief. They've been barely hanging on the last few years. I feel like the focus wasn't on building a team but rather keeping the streak alive. Next year they can start fresh in a new arena and hopefully rebuild the empire. GO WINGS!
"On the plus side, ticket prices are cheaper!"

We live in a world where Edmonton made it to the playoffs and Detroit didn't.
I turned 26 12 days ago. This is a new feeling. It's been a hell of a streak.
Well it was a hell of a ride. 
It was always so much fun to watch the Wings in the Playoffs. Not being in this year is going to be incredibly awkward.
"maybe that's what's been keeping the sharks from winning the stanley cup...

EDIT: remember this comment if this theory comes correct in june"
"Also, what am I supposed to feel right now"
"The streak started the year I was born, part of me just died."
"I still had three weeks to just chill out, not a care in the world, hanging out in my moms junk before they were officially eliminated. I can remember playing NHL Stanley Cup on SNES when I was like 5 and you always picked Detroit. That's 20 years ago and up until this season in almost any NHL game you could say to a new player, ""Enh, just pick Detroit"". This is come surreal stuff for me. Sorry wing dings, I have always enjoyed watching you guys, but ever since we lost the Red Wings - Sharks series it's just never been the same. Good luck in the off season.

What is dead my never die."
Wow. A tiny part of me was thinking somehow they'd go on some miraculous run and pull it off. This is weird.
Fuck...so this is what it feels like?
That's a helluva run. Respect.

"I get to respect Wings fans now!

Well, at least the ones that stick by the team. I've always respected Wings fans, but it's always been tough to differentiate the dedicated from those just along for the ride, seeing as they haven't had a truly losing season in my lifetime.

And you know what? I look forward to the day when the wings manage to rebuild into a contender. Detroit is a great hockey city, and it kinda sucked watching the team be mediocre for these past few years."
Speechless.  Great run Detroit!
Wow I remember them making 8 year old me cry when they swept the caps in the finals... To think they havent missed a post season even since then impresses me so much 
I'm not high enough for this :(
As a Detroit native. This makes me utterly sad. They've been in the playoff's since I was 7 years old. Crazy. 
Absolutely unreal streak!
Wow. Holy fuck. First time in my lifetime. I guess it couldn't last forever but it's gonna take awhile to sink in. Still fuckin love my wings no matter what. Unconditionally. Fuck.
"So like, what do yall do when your team doesn't make the playoffs?"
Welcome to the East elimination basement Detroit. Booze is in the corner and we have a few old cups to drink out of if you forgot to bring yours :(
Both Detroit and club penguin is in mourning today
"Man, I don't even give a fuck that the streak is over. I'm 32, started watching when I was 12. Never saw a bad Wings team, saw them in the playoffs every season and saw then win a cup 4 times. Why in the hell should I be sad? I'm not.

Time for the rebuild. It's been long overdue. "
\\_ \\_ \\_
"Such an extraordinary streak.  My son (now 23) never knew a time when the Wings sucked.  I'm old enough to remember when the 
 Red Wings were known as the Dead Things.  I remember being able to go down to the Joe just before the game and get tickets for the top 2 rows (nosebleed)...then move down to the first couple rows in the upper bowl because it was so empty.  

The Wings did well in the 80's and 90's with the draft...then free agency and trades to fill holes.  But those trades came at a cost.

You can't trade away draft picks and draft at the bottom for 15 years and stay at the top in the NHL.  The Wings were able to offset this for a number of years due to superior scouting (especially in Europe).  The rest of the league has caught up to them (or the Wings' scouting has just gotten worse).

In the salary cap era, the Wings weren't able to land quality free agents.  Seems to be such a turnaround because the Wings had a team where they were able to get just about any free agent they wanted.

Thanks for the memories and the 4 Cups.  Maybe the Tigers can surprise this year (and I'm not even going to bring up the Lions...because they're the Lions)."
This honestly doesn't feel right. 
"Welcome to the reality of being a hockey fan, Wings."
I'm not crying! YOU'RE crying! 
This has never been posted on reddit before. Should we mark this as OC?
"It was fun while it lasted. Time to regroup, and get ready for next season. "
This is the thread. Congratulations.
This fact hasn't been true since before the internet.
"Seriously can't believe this. History has finally been sort of made.

Faded red wing flairs are gonna look weirddddddd."
Good. I'm tired of limping into the playoffs and getting bounced in the first round because our management is so afraid to lose the streak that they won't make the moves needed to actually compete for a cup. Let the rebuild begin. We haven't been a cup contending team since at least 2013.
These tears nourish me. 
I've never experienced this in my 21 year old life. I don't know how to feel. 
First time in my lifetime. Time to see what a pre-playoffs fade feels like.
That can happen?
Finally. I lived in a year where Detroit is not going to the playoffs.
"Fucking fade me fam.

Thanks to this team for getting me into hockey and playing it for 15 years. "
:( can someone hold me?
I was born when the streak began. Does this mean I'm dead now?
I was born in 91. I don't know life without the Red Wings in the playoffs. I don't like change.
"1st round is now wide open, boys. "
Was a hell of a run. Proud to have been born before the beginning of this feat.
Holy cow finally but what a run. Good luck in the off-season Red wings
_/ Stick taps for a great 25 year run. It's kind of fitting the streak dies the same year they close down Joe Louis 
"Man. As a Leafs fan, it makes me sad to see the Wings out. It's one team I've never hated, always wanted to beat when we played them, and respected the loss.

Congrats to Detroit and to the passing of the Illitch era. What an amazing time you guys have hockey from 1990-now.

Hope you guys get back in there soon.

"I remember playing NHL 2004 obsessively when I was younger. The Detroit Red Wings were my favorite team, so whenever I created my own team, I'd steal their players. I loved Lichtemheimer or whatever, Federov, Neidermayo, the Dominator, and Yzerman. I'd create my fake players too with the sliders all on 99, make sure there are no penalties, replay the games where I lost fights because it was that emotionally scarring, and of course, I made Federov team captain because fuck you thats why."
Serious question. What do i do the whole month of April? Pretend to like baseball? Pretend to like golf? Pretend to like my family? Nah. I can't.

"Damn. This post made me sad. I miss the Redwings in our division because they were a team of vets coached by a god with some of my favorite players of all time. The Sharks and Redwings rivalry was my favorite because the you didn't have to worry about them playing dirty, just beating your team in fundamentals and occasional magic from the one and only. Hope they turn it around next season and regain their rightful place in the playoff race. <3"

"As a Detroit fan this has been known ever since we lost Datsyuk. 
We have some SERIOUS potential with Mantha, happy to see you, and D-boss. Our defense is atrocious but we have a deep pool to pick from and green can show them the way. 
It sucks to lose a streak but we knew we'd be eliminated first round even if we did make it. Shed the dead skin of a pointless stat and work on busking another dynasty. 
LGRW 
Fuck the cup this year. We want draft picks. We got talent. We will be a force to reckon with in a few years. "
A great run but damn we need some top 10 draft picks. 
Anyone know if Harbaugh is an effective hockey coach? 
The end of an era.
"The worst thing is that when Detroit becomes good again, it doesn't matter how many times they make it in a row, they'll probably never hit that number again :'(

in all seriousness, I don't know how to feel. I get that a lot of our fans are like ""yeah we need this, embrace the tank, blah blah blah"" and they're not exactly wrong, but at the same time... I love hockey, but kinda fell out of it for the last like 4 or 5 years prior to last season, except for when the playoffs kicked in. Part of the reason I started watching intently against was moving to Toronto, out of my parents' house, and had actually good internet. I can now stream games, and this season I watched more Wings hockey than ever before, which of course turned out to be our worst season in 26 years. Even still, playoff hockey always got me very excited, even if we lost in the first round.

I know it's just a game, and it'll be all new in 6 months, but I genuinely don't really know how to feel. Toronto has always been a close second team of mine, so I'm not new to this feeling of being out of the playoffs, but it's different. I'm still going to cheer for the Red Wings every season and hope they get better, because watching them in the playoffs gives me some feeling of hope, even the past two seasons.

Here's to the next season, in the new arena. Maybe with Mike Ilitch's legacy ending, so does that era of Red Wings, and so begins a new one."

"This really sucks. Myself, like many other Wings fans haven't even lived in a world where the Red Wings aren't in the playoffs. It was always a fact that Detroit would be in the post-season. I used to think that every team made the playoffs, just because the my team was always there, with out a doubt. Today I am sad."
Our record is safe!
"This is undeniable proof that ALL dynasty's WILL eventually fall. It happened to the Celtics, it happened to the Canadiens, it happened to the 49ers, and now it's the Red Wings turn. A quarter century of making the playoffs is a remarkable achievement. The last time the Red Wings missed the playoffs was a year before I was born. This is the first time in my life time that they have missed the playoffs. It's absolutely surreal. It fucking sucks, but it was inevitable. When Lidstrom retired, the Red Wings productivity decreased dramatically. We were very fortunate to have been making the playoffs after he retired. Datsyuk and Zetterberg at that point kept this team on life support. As soon as Datsyuk left, I knew that was it. Zetterberg can't do everything by himself. Inconsistent goal tending, disastrously bad defense, and now shitty coaching has officially doomed the Red Wings. And now with Mike Ilitch gone, the future of this franchise remains unclear. Can we trust Chris Ilitch to make the right decisions? Just because you have the Ilitch name, doesn't mean you will be competent. His first big test begins this offseason, and I'm really hoping we don't resort back to another ""dead wings"" era as a result of potential incompetence. Fire Blashill, fire Holland. Rebuild from the ground up. With the new arena debuting next season, this is the perfect time to do it. I am so grateful that Red Wings era of dominance occurred during a period where the Tigers and Lions were considered some of the worst teams in all of professional sports. Who knows, maybe the Lions will finally shine in the spotlight while the Red Wings work on getting their shit together. Thank you Detroit Red Wings for allowing me to grow up with a team that I can officially call a dynasty. Hopefully, it wont take an eternity for you guys create a new dynasty and we can create new memories in a new era. Farewell, Mike Ilitch/Joe Louis Arena era Detroit Red Wings. Thank you for allowing me to grow up with you guys. It was a lot of fun. Dead Wings Era, don't you fucking dare come back."
"Lifelong Wings fan here. I know, we have been extremely lucky to make the playoffs 25 years straight and that this day would eventually come.

"I've been a Wings fan as long as I can remember, and my dad was a huge Leaf fan. Growing up was always a massive chirp fest between us, but he didn't have much to chirp about in the past few seasons. Without fail, he would call me every time the Wings were eliminated from the playoffs. He would call literally seconds after an OT loss just to rub salt in the wounds. I hated it when I was younger, but laughed my ass off as an adult because that was just how we rolled. He passed away about a year and a half ago, and all I want right now is that call. He deserved this one."
The first year I will be alive and the wings wont be in the playoffs *sobbing*
At least the streak wasn't broken by Brock Lesnar
"um so what do i do now...? last time we didn't make the play offs I was a fucking 10 years old, I was sleeping in a bunk bed, and living off of spaghetti-ohs, and took baths. I'm now married, have a child of my own (who eats far healthier than I did), own a house, and like am a mid thirties ""responsible"" adult...The Joe is closing, the Wings are in last place, our beloved owner died...BUT I WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING! we had one of the greatest runs of any sports organization, we build maybe the greatest team NHL team of all time in that 2002 squad, I got to see 4 cups, and 25 years worth of playoff excitement. you can't have the sweet without the sour...We will be back, and you all better protect yo neck!

LOL 22k upvotes.. my gawd.
The best part about this thread is all the Hawks fans saying thank god and good riddance even though they've only been watching the sport for the last 7 years of the streak. 
"It's... it's over. It's been 25 straight years in the playoffs and it's finally over. I've been watching since around the time it started, when I was 8 or 9. It's crazy to think about. Pardon me while I ramble...

In the beginning, during the 90's, I don't think anyone would think this would happen. Heck, it wasn't even until they won the first Cup during the streak that anyone thought the team was gonna be a contender even with the record breaking 62 win season right before. But then they won and the tradition continued. '97 was crazy, then the crash and the desire to repeat for Vlad and winning it was nuts. There was talk of a three-peat but it was sadly stopped. The team was still dominant and would cause all sorts of problems for teams.

As the early 2000's started, the team started to look real good again. The management pulled some crazy moves to start to put together the all star team. Hull, Robitaille, and Hasek were all added and holy crap this team. There'll never be a team put together like this again. It was crazy to think this was even allowed and, well, probably the reason a salary cap would eventually be put in place. The Cup win in '02 solidified the team as one of the best ever put together. As the decade went on, the Wings stumbled a little bit early one season (I specifically remember over hearing someone in one of my lab classes saying ""Well now the Wings suck"". Oh lawls.) but they continued to dominate despite the eventual retirement of Yzerman and the departure of Fedorov. I think at this point is when folks started to pay attention to the streak. I mean, some real good teams can continue a streak like that for a decade for sure (Pens currently at 10). Hitting 15 years though with not much slow down? Then they won the Cup yet again in 2008 and then repeated a finals appearance in 2009? Holy crap, that's 18 years of dominance! The salary cap was meant to slow this sort of thing down but 4 years after they're still going strong.

Well, it was going to slow down. Wings fans started to see it come around 2010 or so. That season the Wings struggled due to massive amount of injuries and their dominance and streak was in jeopardy. Thankfully the Wings went on a crazy post-Olypmic run going 13-2-2 and kept the streak going. But soon the wheels were coming off. I like to think of the first indicator of the fall was the early retirement of Brian Rafalski. Rafalski was a top tier defenseman who, along with Lidstrom, solidified the Wings blue line the past few years and was going to be hard to replace. And, well, he didn't get replaced. The Wings had some solid d-man still along with the robot hall of famer Nick Lidstrom but the cracks were starting to show. A few seasons later and Lidstrom retired as well and not much was done to replace him. However, how can you replace such a player? You can't but you can try and it felt like management didn't even try. Still, Kronwall took over as top d-man and was solid for a few seasons. Management continued to try their hand at grabbing aging stars to shore up some help, grabbing Modano and Alfredsson, Mo receiving mixed results and Alfie being solid but only staying for a season. Datsyuk and Zetterberg continued to be strong on offense but things were starting to tread down hill as they had 2 then 3 early playoff exits. And then... well, here we are today.

Some will say with the early playoff exits and no sign of getting near a Cup the last few years that the Wings should've started rebuilding sooner. With the playoff record of 30 years only a handful away, some wanted to see the record broken. Cups are important but breaking an NHL record especially during the post-salary cap era of great parity? Personally I'd say that's a noble goal. But without any hope of reaching more than second-round, the streak starts to feel... boring... and frustrating. Noble and a great achievement if they could do it but mainly frustrating. I'd imagine if they had reached second round once or twice in the last few years and if the record was only 2 or 3 years away then more folks might want to see it reached. But 5 more years at this point with a team that might only barely make it in is a hard pill to swallow.

Making the record is a noble and exciting goal. But having Cups is more exciting and you'd be hard pressed to find someone who said playoff appearances are more important than actually winning Cups. A streak like this probably won't happen again for the foreseeable future. A few years from now some folks may begin to argue whether coming this close to the record but falling short was a disappointment not worth rebuilding yet for. The argument won't matter though as the reality of it is that it's over. 

I always liked to think the road to the Cup ran through Detroit and for quite some time that was true. But much like other roads in Michigan, it's time to tear it down and rebuild. The future looks bright though with the young stars of Athanasiou, Mantha, and Larkin. I'd like to think it won't be long before the Wings will be back to their familiar territory of a playoff team. Until then, it was a wild ride and I'm glad I got to watch the all these amazing Red Wings teams dominate the league for all these years. What a time to be a fan."

"It's hard to believe it's been so long that the Wings didn't suck. I remember as a kid in the 80s, JLA was near  empty for every game. The team was quite generous and frequently gave tickets to entire pee wee teams a few games per season. There was no Hockeytown back then but as a kid, going down to the scorers booth and coming away with game pucks and broken sticks, made me into a huge Red Wings fan for life! I definitely have enjoyed this last quarter of a century, I think, more so, because of the dark years prior to this run. Thanks for so many great seasons.

Shout out to John O'Grodnick."
finally
"I remember when I was a young boy, early 90s (91~93). I started enjoying hockey and for some reason became a fan of the Red Wings. I had their jersey, a hat, a flag. My father (a Habs fan) brought me to the Bell Center (previously the Molson Center) for a Habs game vs the Red Wings. They lost 4-1 that night, but it was a blast. Since then, even tho' I'm a Habs fan these days, the Wings have a soft spot in my heart.

I still find it hard to wrap my head around the fact that I won't be able to secretly cheer for the Wings as my second team in the playoffs this year. It's a sad night... but what a fucking run.

"As a Michigander, I feel like this what will trigger Rome crumbling. "
Incredibly impressive. Also a very clean and convenient number to end on. I don't expect them to be out for long that being said.

"MY CLIENT, THE BOSTON BRUINS, CONQUERED THE RED WINGS STREAK"
"Very weird to see. Consistent for 25 years. I wasn't even born!

Amazing run, it hurts to see it go, though. Our city still has fighting chances for other sports, though! That's what I love about it! We're always close, but not always winning everything."
Blues got 25 seasons of playoffs with no cup.. could be worse
April's gonna be so weird without the Red Wings in the playoffs...
I'm sad 🙁
Being a coyotes fan this is the highlight of my franchise
Damn. This is the first time in my life that the Wings haven't made it to the playoffs.
"I have been alive for 29 years...this is the first I'll remember them not playing. 

It's been a hell of a run, and I think we'll be back much sooner than later."
"Oh happy day, CBJ! "
While 14 year old me hates the wings and wanted their streak to always end. Older me is somewhat sad as it means the end of an era really in Detroit
"This is depressing, and next year will be a decade without a cup, and the year after a decade without a finals appearance. 

Dark times are ahead. "
The red wings are responsible for one of my darkest childhood moments. They swept my beloved Flyers in the '97 cup finals. But serious kudos to them for this impressive streak
"Correct me if I am wrong, but I feel like the past few seasons the Red Wings have just barely been making the playoffs.

Haven't paid close attention to their stats and all that, but from my point of view it seems that way."
Gonna be a rough next 3-4 years in Hockey Town.
"So damn heartbreaking. I have hope that our Wings will bounce back, but going out like this won't be forgotten for a long time. "
Man the streak began the year I was born what will I do when the playoffs start
"Not even that big a hockey fan, but this is a sad night for every Detroiter. Fade us :("
"Hell of a run Detroit. Respect.  

_/ _/"
"this was a rough year for us. RIP peace Gordie, Mr. I, the Joe, and the playoffs."
"For the first time in Reddit history before the playoffs, fade me."
"Lots of great players have left the wings in recent years, the team has been aging. I think this was expected to happen soon. "
" ♩ ♪ ♫ It feels like the first time, Feels like the very first time ♩ ♪ ♫

So... This is what it's like to be faded early. "
"It's sad, but if you looked at the last few years of playing you could see it was going to end eventually. Thank you for the 25 great seasons getting the 3rd longest streak for making the playoffs in league history. "
"i think its something like, 500 skaters currently in the NHL weren't even born the last time they were eliminated. thats nuts to think about."
Kill me
This sad
"Amazing ride, amazing teams and amazing players who have played and made that streak, those 4 cups possible. Wings fans have been lucky, all hockey fans have been lucky.. "
"I was walking around Vegas with my Wings t-shirt on Friday. I actually got a lot of ""LGRW"" from strangers. The legacy lives on."
WITNESS ME!
"Welcome to our world Wings fans. 

Signed, 

Devils fans.  "
Thank god it's over. Maybe Holland and co. can concentrate on making us an actually good team rather than a mediocre one that limps into the playoffs every year.
"Good for them. gives the team a chance to rest, figure out what to fix, and get back for the playoffs next year. It sucks that they didn't make the playoffs, but with the team they have, it's hard to imagine they would've gone deep anyway."
Question for Red Wings fans.  Would you rather have had another 10 years added on to this playoff streak and no Stanley cups or miss the playoffs the next 2 or 3 and see one in 4 or 5? Sort of curious
WHY ARE YOU ALL UPVOTING THIS???
Avs fans have finally something to cheer about.
_/
Are we all gonna ignore the linked streamble? Like wtf is that? A dry humping competition? 
"I didn't even realize my flair was already faded.

What a time to be alive."
"When I got into hockey, I was a Wings fan for the first few years before shifting my attention to Winnipeg, I've always had love for the Wings and I've always had a soft spot for them. They'll be back. Zetts deserves another one."
Not to sound salty but it's funny how so many of the people in here dissing the Wings and calling them shit have prominent members of their organization that made their name with the Wings. Toronto and Tampa owe a large part of what they are now to people coming over from Detroit. That and sucking ass for like 50 years.
"Ok I just did some crazy math. 

Since the dawn of time there have been 217 video games about hockey. 

Since 1990 there have been 206 video games about hockey. 

So for those 206 video games published, the Red Wings made the playoffs. 

So for ~95% of the Hockey Video games have the Red Wings making the playoffs. 

That is insane-o.

So. I'm assuming that somebody noticed that the last season that the Red Wings missed the playoffs was the 89-90 season which is 27 years ago not 25.

It was the switch the the Eastern Conference that did them in. Much harder conference than the Western. Far more competitive.
Tell that to mike Babcock after he wins the cup
"Such a great streak, don't be sad it's over. Just hope that Detroit can get their stuff together come 2017-2018 and they can begin their road on the streak again."
"I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending like missing out on the last day. Here we've known it was going to happen for a while now and it was just a matter of when. Still, I've been waiting for this since I became a hockey fan. It's finally their turn to suck again. "

As an Avs fan. This feels good 
"We may suck this year, but I take solace in the fact that Detroit sucked worse"

Now let's just hope we don't play ourselves out of a top 5 pick after being a bottom 5 team through the majority of the season.

As time went on I hate/loved the wings. I won tickets to the Winter Classic a couple of years ago and froze my ass off at the big house. Still hated the Wings. Then, my job opened labs it Detroit area. I went up more and more. Then, a year ago I was in town for opening day and I saw an octopus tossed on opening day at the Joe and I was in. I realized what the Wings meant to my hockey fandom and I realized I was wrong. You can hate the Wings but they mean everything to hockey to an American. "
Maybe itll make them wake up and realize that they actually need to win the cup to make getting to the playoffs worth anything...

"I've had two dope Red Wings snap back hats I've been loyally wearing all season. My brother in law took the first one by accident to Alberta so I bought another.  Last week my husbands car got broken into and they stole a few hats including my NICE NEW REDWINGS HAT.
You assholes.  This is Canucks town. If I see this awesome hat on your stupid head I'll pound your dumb face like McCarty vs Lemieux. Just saying. 
Not that they lost because I lost two hats, but it still still stings. The bottom line is we lost Babcock 2 years ago and Datsyuk after and had a shitty season this year all around. Now we sit and wait for October  because NEXT year? We are gonna blow the pepperoni off of Little Ceasers Arena. Go Wings Go. Even when it's bleak as shit, baby. LGRW.

Edit. If you're going to downvote then tell me how I'm wrong. Holland is a joke. Let's debate

Holland didn't do shit other than sign players to long contracts that handcuffed the Wings. He wasn't the GM until 1997 or 98. He didn't create the dynasty or keep the players there. They were all there when he was granted the GM. He didn't pay players more to keep them there when he got there, that was Ilitch. Then when the cap came in he showed how he sucked as a GM even more.Those Red Wing teams with 10-11 Hall of Famers on the team should have won many more Cups if Holland didn't suck so bad but after 2002 Holland didn't have a clue what to do to make the team better after the players he inherited started leaving."

And then cry because it will never happen again.
"Seriously though I'm sure in some ways this is almost a relief. There were some close calls the past few years, now that it's over I'm sure it's sort of a burden lifted for some of the younger guys.  

No doubt they wanted to make the playoffs and continue it, but now that it's done the Wings can buy more into youth and they kids can make the team their own and start their own streak."

"As much as our players are underperforming, you gotta look at the real culprit here: Injury. Wings had a pretty devastating run of injuries in November and December, one of those being our real starting goalie. With shaky goaltending in December and January, we fell out of a spot real quick

worse than losing like 6 or 7 games in that stretch was losing to divisional rivals. THAT is why we're out. that and it seems like every other team was able to put together a win streak except us. It's a lot closer than it looks. "
Bahahahaha. Pretty sure genocide would be needed for that sacrifice.
"And in that 25 year playoff streak, the Lions didn't win a single playoff game."

The red wings subreddit was calling for a rebuild for several years, but deep down, none of us really want a rebuild. We want heroes. 

Heroes is the M.O. for Detroit. Yzerman. Fedorov. Konstantinov. Murphy. Lidstrom. Vernon. Osgood. Shanahan. Chelios. McCarty. Hasek. Fetisov. Hull. Robitaille. Datsyuk. Zetterberg. the List continues...

"Shit, I wasn't even born when the streak happened. And I'm 23."
"They were good for a very long time (last missed the playoffs in 1990), which means they haven't been getting any top draft picks, and they haven't been able to replace guys who've gotten older or retired. It's inevitable - they were just squeaking in for a couple of years, but it'll help them more in the long run to miss the playoffs and be able to add more youth to the system."
"In my opinion, the front office took more pride in keeping the streak alive rather than build a stronger team. Didn't make good free agency acquisitions, signed some horrible deals, and made bad trades. Datsyuk leaving didn't help either. We really should have missed a couple years ago, but we held on by a thread. "

My response? Bitch, I'm halfway to 40 and started following the Penguins in '93. And I certainly remember the Red Wing fandom exploded in 97-98.  You know, after they started winning after 40+years of being shit.  You think the Penguins implosion was fun after a great year of Mario coming back to put on a magical comeback season?  Fuck no, but as a fan, you take the good with the bad.  And, now you get to learn what it's like to take the ribbing.  It's all good!

They were never in the Stanley cup together because they always were in the same western conference together.  They were great rivals though and individually made it to the cup many years in the 90's and early 2000's

"Other than Datsyuk, what ""great"" players left in recent years? "
"True, I don't want to write too much...but I want to see the damage Babs and the Leafs will do.

Babs always talked about deep playoff runs and I'm sure he missed them in his final years with DET. That being said, I'm interested to see what playoff experience does to a young Leafs team. It was always a similar mindset with DET making it each year that you'd mentor these 'kids' and giving playoff experience. Kinda a moot point now...but the Leafs are at the start of that cycle with a coach at the helm who has playoff experience.

O6 I'm onboard with some hype!"
"As long as Holland is in charge, they wont figure it out"
"The writing has been on the wall the past 3-4 years. It was clear that the younger players were just not of the caliber to lead a team.

Limping into the playoffs and getting ousted in the first round was getting old. It's time to restock. This is how the NHL works."
Rather see a cup in 5 then add 10 to our streak
"Not a Wings fan but I would take the second option for sure, I think most people would."
"Oh mang! I would have liked to beat out the other hockey streaks and not have won a cup for half the time. Say if we got to 30 years. I think BOS had 27 years, and Blues 26---so another 2-3 would have been stellar. 

As mentioned, the writing was on the wall the past few years. Tough in transition and with always drafting low. Not only that, but an aging core when Babs was around plus signing a lot of guys that have been nothing but solid for us yet limits us with new talent for the future.

Now at least we had 4 in this time with 2 of them being back-to-back. "

Are Leafs fans chirping the Wings for this? Sounds dumb. The Wings are the best ran franchise ever. And you only said the Leafs and Tampa but even the Hawks and Dallas owe everything to the Wings too. Florida also.

That wasn't the case in previous years.
"Had nothing to do with the switch. In fact I'd say the only reason they made it to 25 was because of how weak the East was.

What did them in was their elite talent leaving with no one to replace them."
"That's whats up! Receiving so much positivity from Canadians and their respective teams. 

Erik Karlsson is life, Swedes forever (DET used to have loads of Swedes)"
nice flair
Avs fan? I'm surprised you can still feel anything at all. I thought this season would've stripped you guys of all feeling.

"During this 25 year playoff streak Detroit won 4 cups. 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2008.

And if they were good? Yes. We had Lidström for all 4 of those cups, who is considered to be one of the best defencemen that the leage has ever seen, and for 3 of them we had Yzerman, the guy who kinda turned our whole team around when he was drafted. The 2002 team currently has 8 Hall of Famers on it, 9 when Datsyuk gets into it."
"Players regressed when Babcock left. He was getting the most out of these players. The bottom went out when Blashill took over, I think. "
"Yeah Babs wanted new ground, I have so much respect for him and everything he did for DET. I'm glad since he's a Canadian he's now able to coach an O6 team for Canada!

As previously mentioned, felt like Babs got more out of the players. Aging core caught up to us more, also over the years lost a few pieces here and there that added up. Franzen on LTIR, Dats leaving this past year, younger players not being effectively used as much.

Much more than that, but its a quick version. "
"Too many transitions all at the same time. It's such a tall order for youth to carry the momentum of all the high-class vets over the last decade while also trying to adapt to the VAST changes the game has seen over the last few years. 

I don't know how ANY coach could come into this league right now and just know how to deal with all the speed that's emerging in the game. "
They have been in the playoff exactly all my life D: guess i know what i have to do now ...
"Truth! I don't want to jinx it, but I'd like to see MTL vs. TOR like round two probably.

Babs wanted deep playoff runs (he done it before), with a young Leafs team if they can learn on the fly...hopefully a force to be reckoned with."

That's the real shocker 
Just imagine how long the streak would be if Jagr didn't go to Russia 
Huh?
"while Jagr hasn't played 25 years in the NHL due to his years in the KHL, he won the Stanley Cup in Pittsburg in both 1991 (26 years ago) and 1992 (25 years ago), so his NHL career absolutely DID exist the last time the Red Wings missed the playoffs"
It was also the last time Edmonton won the Cup and the only time they've ever won without Gretzky.
I want to get off /u/harmancombe's wild ride
26 years ago? Wasn't he a rookie?
I'm 31 and even I think the NHL without Jagar seems weird
"Jagr is the last active NHL player whose name shall never be removed from the stanley cup. 

first time he won with the penguins, they engraved it on the shoulder above the rings.

it means also that no matter how long he takes to lift that fucker again, he'll have the longest gap between first and last times his name is engraved on the cup. "

You saw so many games where the Red Wings would dazzle other teams with their puck movement and the way they would use all five guys on the rush to create offense.  It was really something to behold.   "

"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Detroit Playoffs the Yze?? I thought not. It's not a story the Joe Louis would tell you. It's a hockey legend. Detroit Red Wings were an NHL hockey team, so powerful and so wise, they could use the AHL to influence the Hockey Gods to create playoff berths. They had such skill and minor leaguers that they could even keep their playoff hopes from dying. The Red Wing method of making the playoffs is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. They became so powerful...the only thing they were afraid of was not making the playoffs, which eventually, they did. Unfortunately, they let their Babcock go to Toronto...and the Leafs eliminated them and their streak. Ironic. They could help the Leafs make the playoffs, but not themselves.

An upvote for you sir.
"Eh, some of the horrible deals look bad in hindsight due to injury (Franzen, Kronwall, Howard) or player regression (Ericsson and Abby, who both obviously benefited from playing with guys like Lidstrom and Datsyuk respectively). Dats leaving and injuries pushed us out this season. KH is definitely too loyal to vets and keeping the streak alive (although that may have been more on the Illitches - winning sells).

Blashill is a fucking goof. 
Lidstrom.
"The man directly responsible for the most successful franchise in recent and current NHL history? Mmmmmkay.

Seriously. Show me a GM in the league that outstretches what Holland has been doing. Any takers? Show me a GM that hasn't missed the playoffs in over two decades, with 4 cups in that span.

I don't care what anyone says, even if the Wings miss the next two seasons, playoff berth in 25 out of 28 seasons is still resounding success."
"I've seen it, not just on here but Facebook, Twitter, etc. However that's obviously just misinformed fans and not the majority opinion. I get not liking detroit or its fans - hell I hate most of my own fan base some times - but to say they're a shit organization is just wrong. One of the reasons we're so bad now (imo) is because 75% of our staff left to bigger roles in other orgs and we got stuck with the dregs."

Never too stripped to hate the Red Wings.

I'm a die-hard Wings fan and have been since 81-82 when I could start watching them on TV.  Iadmif I have an irrational hatred for Holland but it's only because for 20 years I've heard how he's the greatest ever and imo he's well below average. I've said for over a decade that Holland needs prove he's a GM or else when Lids leaves we are screwed. Hakan Andersson saved us getting Datsyuk and Zetterberg but what else has he done when player after player retired? Get Bertuzzi and sign Cleary to a long term contract?

"Heck yeah, and now we got to embrace 'failure'. I just see it as me being a spoiled fan for my whole life, and now I got to root from the ground up.

I know Nill is going to continue to make moves, I have confidence he'll find the right parts and start to carve out the Thunderdome again."

False. The Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League hold that record. With 34 consecutive playoff appearances between 1972 and 2005.
I'm hoping Cam can get it done for you guys. Had nothing but respect for him since his godly seasons back in the day
"That's not really recent, that was 6 years ago"
"it is, but he's also shown that hes inept in the cap era. Teams like the Hawks and Pens are light years beyond us right now. I don't get why people can't see this, it's like red blinders. Yes, he brought us great success, but a bunch of 1st round exits and now this...?"
"It's crazy. I want them to be good when we are so we can have a battle again. 

"
"So have we mate, so have we."
Two years. 
"Yeah they were in the West.....during their best years. You do know they moved four years ago right?

The only reasons they made it in 2014, 2015 & 2016 is because Boston/Washington shit the beds, & the weak East in general."
"Fair enough, the Avs/Wings hatred runs deep for those of us that were around to see that rivalry. Best rivalry in all of professional sports, in my opinion."
Just a soft jab. The Flyers logo sort of looks like a rip off of the winged wheel. 
Nah
"I think now that the streak has ended, we'll see what kind of GM KH actually is. He has to build a team rather than buy one. It'll be an interesting few years for us as we rebuild. I'm not all aboard the KH hype train, but I'm cautiously optimistic about him. He's signed until 2019, I believe, so I think we'll at least give him a shot to build us up by then. We shall see though. I will say for the Wings, I'm glad we've been able to retain most of our greats. I remember back in the early 2000s when there was speculation that Datsyuk would leave for the Caps in FA or chase a big contract. "
Larkin to Mantha to Athanasiou. Make's for one hell of a rivalry.
You're so edgy dude.

Such is Detroit
You guys had a good run
wow this took a turn I was not expecting. forecast checks out
"If Matt Millen becomes your GM he will draft wide receivers, even further compounding the problem. "
"Draft 5 offensive defensemen.

In the same draft."
"First of all, it's *Matt* Millen, and Holland has already proven that's he's an exponentially better GM that Millen. At worst, KH is a competent but overly conservative GM who puts too much trust and loyalty in vets. 

Secondly, we already have a lot of promising young players (Mantha, AA, Larkin, Svech, Mrazek). We need help on defense of course, but we're in a better spot to rebuild than most teams.
"
I'll get the paper bags ready.
"Dumars is a better analogy. Good for a while, and then so, so very bad. "
Please God no :(
"pls no, I can't go through that again. "

Why did you have to put that jinx on us."
"We made the playoffs once between '97 - '08...

Red Wings playoff shit show from 2017 to 2030! Muahahahaha!
"
I refuse to call it anything other than the Pizzarena
"Oh I know. I'm fairly comfortable with our rebuild since we have a lot of pieces in place (Larkin, Mantha, AA, Mrazek, hopefully Svech pans out). We really need help on defense, but we have a lot of promising guys on offense, plus an amazing captain."
That's the Detroit Lions motto as well!
Every.Single.Year.

"We tend to get a bad wrap. We like the competition, and enjoy chirping fans, but we aren't assholes lol. We understand that we are all fans of the same sport and don't try and put ourselves above others. We root for our team and stand behind them.

Vancouver had a riot, Montreal is literally the hell hole of Canada. We try and be pure class."
Yea but you lost it and Yzerman picked it up.
"As a Bruins fan married to a Red Wings fan, that was a rough week..."
I love Datsyuk but don't discount Babcock leaving.
"i personally think that is what makes this ""easier"" we saw it coming, the last 2-3 years, Babs leaves, we squeak into the playoffs, Dats leaves, the writing was on the wall..."
"Babcock, Pavel, Ilitch. Not a great year to be a Wings fan. Still have to look back at our embarrassment of riches over the past 25 years and realize that this is still a franchise that others look at and aspire to. "
I guess losing one of the best coach in hockey doesn't help too much either.
"I'd argue that Pavel was on the decline.   The real issue is our Griffin players didn't end up being as stellar as we'd expected in the NHL.  Tatar, Nyquist, Pulkinen, Jurco, etc. haven't developed at the rate necessary for success.  Larkin plateaued, and we're not the free agent destination that we were pre-salary cap.  I also believe that trying to keep the playoff run going hurt our draft picks, which is where the NHL rebuilds in 2017."
no way that was the only reason.
"Im wondering, what's happened to you guys? I havent been watching much of you guys but all i see is loss after loss after loss"
He partook in the ritual which created it.

"Yeah, I thought maybe I was missing out on a joke or something. Or maybe they were starting from the time he came back into the NHL after spending a few years in Russia, but that doesn't make any sense either.

It always bothers me how good Stafford is and how bad the Lions are.
"The Lions have basically had the division lead handed to them on a silver platter both last year and in 2014 and squandered it at the end of the season. I'm not saying they can't win it, but the current team has a history of choking (and worse, letting the Pack take it from under their noses *again* -- come on, guys). 

That said, I shouldn't shit talk much because I feel like the Vikings are going to suck really, really bad this year (worse than a lot of people are predicting, like 3-6 wins bad, but that's just my opinion, lots of other people are optimistic for some reason). "

"I get that, I do. I'm not just talking about his numbers, his proverbial ""intangibles"" aren't what they were last year. Don't get me wrong, I hope he improves, it's just yet to be seen and we've seen many rookies do great then peak just above mediocre. "

"The players took first round exits, not Holland. Jesus this is frustrating.

YOU are projecting your perception of failure onto the one man you think is responsible for ""everything"". Ken Holland is not the coach, the trainers, the players. He is one of the best GMs in the sport's history. The Wings miss the playoff ONE TIME and people jump down his throat and demand his job. 

You want examples? Steve Ott, brilliant acquisition in ways I didn't see until halfway through the season. He dumped Datsyuk's massive contract that would've hindered the season even more, gave the team as much of a chance to keep the streak alive as he could.

Ken Holland didn't underperform on the power play. Ken Holland didn't break Zetterberg's back. Ken Holland didn't put chips on the shoulders of young prospects. These things happen in this sport, and many people have been so fucking spoiled by this franchise's success that they can't accept the blatantly obvious. There are 30 teams. If only one team won every single year, this league would SUCK.

Just for a little while, try sitting back and enjoying the game."

"I don't man, I think the game has finally slowed down in his mind. For about two thirds of the season, Larkin was definitely struggling and just flying by plays. You don't see him just over skating plays now; he actually knows how to use his speed. He had the benefit of Pav and Hank drawing attention away from him last season, but teams this season knew they could just muscle him off the puck early on. He's looked a lot stronger and a lot feistier out there lately. Once he learns how to protect the puck like Z, I think he can be a top 2C for us. He just has to position himself better. Hank isn't the biggest guy, but his positioning is superb which makes it hard to knock him off the puck. I've noticed Mantha using his body more to shield the puck like Z, and I think Larkin and AA can make that jump as well. I'm not saying Larks will be the amazing possession center that Dats and Z are, but I definitely like what I've seen from him the past few weeks. He's been in on plays and his hustle has led to great scoring chances for us. I love what our young guys have done this year despite their struggles, and I can't wait to see them next season."

"No offense taken at all, buddy. I appreciate the insight and passion for the Wings, and I admittedly am not the best at dissecting constructive criticism of our FO. I don't give him a pass per se, but I don't know if we can completely blame him for continuing the streak. Winning teams sell tickets and merch, and it could have very well been Mr. I pushing the streak. I definitely take issue with some of his signings and trades (*cough* Quincey), but every GM has those and a lot of the contracts didn't seem bad at the time but the player has either regressed after a career year (Ericsson, Abby) or had injury issues (Franzen, Howie, Kronner). 

I'm on the fence about KH and definitely wish we had kept Stevie Y. instead, but that's more hindsight and homerism on my part. For me, this is the first time we'll see what KH can do as the architect of a team. He inherited a great roster that Jim Nill had a huge hand in building, and KH was able to essentially buy players to make us competitive. I'm eager to see how KH responds to this season, but I'm also a bit anxious. He has been slow to adjust to the new NHL, which has definitely set us back on rebuilding."

"Fun fact: [Matt Millen was one of the Eagles fans who threw snowballs at Santa](http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/santa/philadelphia.asp)

The quote:

> “It was a miserable day and a miserable team,” recalls [Matt] Millen, who was 11 years old at the time. “That was the only fun part of the game, and everybody joined in — fathers, sons, even the old ladies. That guy had it coming. I still remember the song, ‘Here Comes Santa Claus’ — BOOM! Got ‘im! Hey, it was just the thing to do at the time. No big deal.”
“But it was different in that era,” he adds. “Very passionate. Franklin Field was a crazy place. People took their football seriously. Hell, they’d run on the field to get at the players and coaches.”

> Millen is now president of the Detroit Lions. How would he feel if fans threw snowballs at his stadium? “Well, we play in a dome,” he says. “So I guess they’d have to smuggle them in.”"

The long and short of it is that we had a solid core that we built up and thought we were going to lose after 2002ish, but managed to find more great young players like Datsyuk and Zetterberg to continue for another 15 years."

"I couldn't agree with your thoughts more!

If Holland made some fuckups I don't care, that's the chances you take noone is perfect. I honestly can't think of 5 good things he's done for the Red Wings in 20 years. 

Mike Ilitch had his pocketbook out and the Wings that re-signed contracts many times said they want to stay in Detroit while negotiation was going on or before.  It's not hard to sign players that want to be here for the most money they can get.  FA's wanted to come here.  in a decade the Wings were top paying team once and the second too for 7-8 years also 

Look at what Holland has done since the cap.  Are there any positives in more than a decade that Holland has done? 

I'm not saying you're wrong or I'm right by any means friend. I just don't see how he's done anything worthwhile here and left us in this situation we have now because he's done nothing.  

I'm not upset because we aren't the greatest or anything like that I swear.  I was a fan of the Wings in the 80's. I was so pumped in 1983 when we drafted after Yzerman, Probie, Kocur and Stu Grimson.  I personally think it's the greatest fun draft in Wings history even more than 1989. My favorite 3 players in history are Dallas Drake, Joey and Fedorov. So I'm ok with not being great but I am irrational when I see Holland praised

Edit: Fixed autocorrect on Probert and Grimson's name"
Technically isnt detroit not invited? since were making the playoffs and they arent
"For the lazy:

Red Wings  1990-91 to 2015-16

- Wins            1,133  - Most

- Goals           6,518  - Most

- Playoff wins   170   - Most

- Stanley Cups   4  - T-Most
"
"Detroit has managed to build their greatness in the modern era. 

Montreal's greatness is largely predicated on drafting pre-1984. Roy carried them to two cups (86 and 93), and they've not got a sniff since. 10 OT wins in a row is the definition of 'lucky cup'. 

So while Montreal has the greater franchise record, I think Detroit's reputation as the best run franchise of the last several decades is more impressive. Competition was greater, roster moves harder, and the ability to continually turn over the team is the most impressive.

"None of that is true actually lol rewatch the clip. The Canes took it down the Wings got it and sent it down ice, AA grabbed it and your defender checked him from behind with no wing on him. There's another wing player right after that with a cane player but they had no part in the play. But yes it doesn't really matter now lol"
"For me, KH's top qualities (in recent memory) are keeping our vets (both good and bad; just glad we didn't lose Z, Dats, or Lidstrom), signing Rafalski and Green, getting a third rounder for Jurco and a second for Smith, and listening to Hakan on some late round snags. The last one is more of a compliment to Hakan obviously, but I love that Hakan is a scouting legend with the Wings and has remained a huge part of scouting process. 

I'm not fond of our cap situation by any means, but Kenny did a decent job dumping Pav's cap hit at least, which allowed us to get Nielsen and Vanek (and a third for Vanek, obviously), plus drafting Cholowski and Hronek (who was just promoted to the AHL after an impressive OHL season). Chychrun has been impressive on a bad Coyotes team, but I time will tell on Cholo and Hronek. I would have rather grabbed Staal than Nielsen in FA last summer, but at least Nielsen is durable. 

I don't think KH is a top 10 GM by any means, but I'm reserving most of my judgment on him until after next season; he's been stuck in stay competitive enough to make the playoffs mode for two decades, and I think that was as much ownership as it was him. I really want to see what he can do with a team that doesn't have the pressure of continuing the streak. We already have some great young players to build on (AA, Larkin, Mantha, Mrazek), and I want to see how he adds to that corps. I really think we'll see a different side to KH this offseason, as he's never been in this situation before. We have a lot of draft picks coming up and will at least be picking in the top 10 for the first time since '91."

"Thanks, friend. I've upvoted yours as well. We really should be more open to other opinions about our organization instead of just downvoting differing opinions. 

I'm admittedly too soft with the Wings (like defending Sheahan, DDK, and KH), but I agree with you that KH gets more credit than he deserves. I think he's been coasting by on the Wings legacy and the rapport he's built through experience without really making many great deals for us (and often pissing away our draft picks for aging vets to make another playoff run that typically ends in an early exit). Winning for as long as we have can make a team complacent, and that's exactly what KH has been. He's too conservative and just hopes that we can upset teams in the playoffs through ""veteran savvy."" Like most fans, I'm sick of the early exits and hate settling for mediocrity (which is essentially what KH traded our picks for previously and has set us back even farther). I'm giving him more leeway than he deserves partially because of the 4 Cups we've nabbed during the streak and partially because even mediocre GMs are hard to find. 


Curious, what do you think of Blash? Is our regression due to his coaching or roster talent?"

"Good riddance, ya pig fuckin' panama paper swingin' nutter!"
"God damn it, I was so excited. I don't even know who this one is, but the wrong David Cameron was definitely fired today. "
As a Brit I got very happy and confused at once.
"Didn't even know there was another dave Cameron, comments confused me for way too long."
"As someone from r/all, fuck you."
"Wait, does UK's Prime Minister play hockey now?"
"I admit, you got me. #SenatorsPapers"
I THOUGHT IT SAID DAVID CAMERON AND I WAS SO HAPPY FOR NO REASON 
rofl thought this was David Cameron
"Read that as David Cameron, got all excited... Damn you"
I got really excited for a minute. 
"This is kind of bullshit, and even though I live around Ottawa and heard this story 4 times already, I got played thinking it was the minister of the UK."
"As someone from the UK I was initially excited, then I saw this want our prime minister that was fired. "
This is very confusing to UK readers.
"This is great news for us if and only if the organization get's its shit together and hires a legit NHL coach with real NHL experience. If we turn around and replace DC with another fucking no experience assistant or juniors coach, we would have been better off maintaining the status quo.

We've had a revolving door of coaches because we keep hiring inexperienced shitty ones and telling them to coach a largely inexperienced and young roster."
Any speculation on who the coach will be yet? 
"Hey look, the NHL App just notified me of this!"
I heard Mike Johnston is available!
Inb4 they hire MVP former Jets coach Claude Noel
Good junior coach doesn't mean good NHL coach.
"Not saying he necessarily did a good job, but i don't get why any decent coach would go there, coaches just get fired after a few years.  That said, I could see Marc Crawford going there."
fucker was eating animal feces on my doorway anyways
Can't you guys just fire Melnyk instead?
This is quite funny as the overlap between people that care about UK and people that are into hockey is not very big.
Saw this at number 1 in /r/all and wondered if he was fired in some bizarre fashion. 
lol I thought this was England.
I thought it was the Prime Minister lol. BREXIT!
coz of panama papers i bet
I thought you meant the British PM then for a second
God dammit I thought this was r/worldnews
I like Hockey. I don't know why this is confusing /all
"Wait, this was not supposed to happen.... WTF just happened?"
Explosions and ice are not compatible. 
"Wow!
What a save!"
Definitely thought it was the Prime Minister Cameron
"So who fired him, old lizzy.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=cGtrvdOvMDY"
my heart raced and got happy for a moment as i misread the title as 'David Cameron has been fired' 
I didnt even know that the UK Prime Minister could get fired.
Hey Sens Bros....I heard through the Grapevine that Yeosie might end up there....maybe your guys won't effing quit on him in the middle of the season...
"Dave Cameron doesn't do what Dave Cameron does for Dave Cameron. Dave Cameron does what Dave Cameron does, because he is Dave Cameron."
"His name is Dave Cameron the famous pioneer no sea to deep, no budget to steep, look there who's that is Dave Cameron"
Man /r/hockey really doesn't like Cameron
Wow even the last two placed teams didn't fire their coaches. 
"Ah, the old /r/hockey switch-a-roo"
"Dodgy Dave got fired ...

Oh wait, the real one is still hanging on"
I remember this headline on /r/all from a while ago. Seems funny in retrospect to David Cameron's retirement.
"Welp, i got excited"
I forgot which sub I was in for a second and got excited
Fuck that Brittish bastard... fuck the Brittish!
Thought for sure this was the PM
"Damn you op, the title made my dick twitch but then I saw which sub it's posted to :/"
"Maybe the problem isn't the coaches, but the owner. "
Damn I thought this was r/politics
Another victim of the Panama Papers
"Damnit, I saw this and was really happy for 5 seconds!"
Oh for a second I thought the UK was saved
Who replaces? Claude Julien (provided he's fired?)
"Oh man, today is *such a good day*.

*#ClaudeJulienWatch2016* has been implemented, Sens fans! "
One Claude Julien plz
"Meanwhile, in Montréal..."
Damn I was hoping they impeached the pig fucker Cameron
So that's how that's done ... interesting.
"Thank you for your service

https://media.giphy.com/media/2t9sDPrlvFpdK/giphy.gif"
ITT: UK fired their prime minister.
"Wooo! Finally the Brits got rid of their corrupt PM!

OH WAIT"
Ugh... Also thought this was the British PM
Seems a bit dodgy to me.
"Fuck, wrong David Cameron."
HAHA GIVE ME YOUR SWEET TEARS R/ALL
"Saw this on the top of r/all, thought ________________________________________________
then I realized this was on r/hockey"
Good on the English for sending this guy a message about money in politics. Glad to see this make the front page of Reddit
That was quick.
Come on Mike Keenan
It was funny watching TH2N this morning listenings to them talk about how there were no coaches in media scrums.
"Welp, that didn't take long."
And they call come tumbling down. 
Thank fucking god. man he was terrible
"Now Cameron didn't do a good job but I'd imagine the issues begin at the management level for the Senators. Five coaches in seven years (something like that), mediocrity, Dorion has some work to do. 

Yeo is likely best candidate out there."
"Fuck, this means they're gonna try to poach the fuck out Travis Green"
What a shitty way to start his morning.
"Ottawa, the only team with a coaching Carousel as bad as Edmonton."
We need a gif of their rolling heads.
Was he a bad coach at all?
Better fight with the Bruins over who is getting Milbury. I hear he has experience.
!!!
Is Kenny Hitchdick on his way outta St Louis?
This is the best day ever.
I hear Todd Richards is looking for a new job...
really just commenting to make sure my bandwagon flair worked 
Someone tell me there is a Jeremy Corbyn coaching somewhere that the Sens can hire!
Did they just take it off of r/all?
If arizona doesn't make moves towards the future his wife might forget his name all together.
there should be a lot of good replacements available depending who shits the bed in the playoffs this year
Who
"Cameron, you SOB. "
"Can we have Paul Maclean back please Jesus Christ I miss that man.

Fuck our ownership for firing him"
So no more Avatar 2? :(
Bye Julien :'(
[Next Ottawa Senators head coach](http://pre00.deviantart.net/e037/th/pre/f/2016/012/d/c/hinata_masaya_by_fu_reiji-d9np81k.png)
Operation Julien Fries was a success.
Before anyone says the team does not spend that is not true they have resigned there core.
If Boston fires Claude. *grabs tissue box*
OPERATION CLAUDE JULIEN/MIKE YEO IS NOW FULLY IN PLAY.
Mike Yeo will be the head coach. Count on it
"I'm American, but this freaked me out for a bit. You really enjoyed scaring us all, didn't yo, OP?"
I hate this sub
Nooo!  He's my favorite curmudgeonly Fangraphs writer!

"There's some overlap, surely."
Once it gets onto r/all there will be also be a bunch of people upvoting because they're celebrating what they think is Britain's PM being gone without reading the article.
This is the least amount of flair I've seen in a /r/hockey thread haha
That's why I love r/hockey.
"Fuck me, I thought our Prime Minister was on his arse...You sneaky Canadian's "
I'm British and nearly had a heart attack
David Cameron fired and Will Smith murdered. Sports are doing a great job confusing the world lately. 
"I was expecting this, I follow hockey religiously, Ottawa is a division rival.

And the first thing I thought of was 'panama leaks'. 

Well played /r/hockey... [well played](http://imgur.com/zzSDo).

EDIT: And that poor Senators webmaster. ""WHAT THE FUCK WE HAVE 1000 TIMES THE TRAFFIC"".


"
95%er here
"Well I sure as shit thought it was the British PM for a hot second. Until I realised it used the word ""fired"" - and then I was like ""Wait, what subreddit is this?"""
why we must seize the memes of production
I am the 95%.
you make this sound like a bad thing
It worked.
"As a member of r/all, I would like to congratulate 95% of upvoters for succeeding in their goal. Your morning is off to a great start. And mine just got a little less exciting. "
"/r/all star here, was getting ready to celebrate, fuck you guys."
We're going to cause a lot of Brits to get shocked for a few seconds today
"I came here and saw it surging so I thought it was big news but apparently not, is this actually a big development? Or was this expected to happen like some Black Monday firings in the NFL or at the end of the season in sports? "
"Confused me on the front page for a split second. They've been asking for Dav_id_ Cameron's resignation, but I didn't think he could be _fired_. And then I saw it was the wrong (but similar) first name and wrong subreddit and pieced it together pretty quickly."
I was so confused why it was so high! Oh my god this is the best post all year!! Haha
"Can confirm, was confused till I saw the Sens url"
"Can confirm, was very confused. Upvoted because I care, and I want others to fall for this shit."
I had to read the title 3 times
"""David Cameron resigned? Wait... Why is it Dave? PM's don't get fired... Oh, /r/hockey you incorrigible jokesters. """
I up voted because it is one of the most important sports events today and should be seen easily for all /r/hockey viewers. Confusing people from the front page just makes it even better
"This is why reddit's great 
"
Thus proving that pretty much nobody reads the articles.
Now he can spend proper time in his official duties in the UK. How is Grant Fuhr doing these days?
Must be a lot of people thinking it's about UK Prime Minister David Cameron. 
Split-second of confusion achieved. Good work everyone.
I'm both 
"As a Brit, you fucking got me."
"If OP *really* wanted some mischief, it would have been titled ""Dave Cameron has been sacked""."
"Yes. Yes you are.

My heart was skipping how excited/confused I was."
I think that's the point.
I think they're gonna have to tank like the Saudi Arabia Oilers.
No commonwealth in the playoffs!
They'll be sitting out of the playoffs just like all the Canadian teams 😂
"""The Senators fired him?  Do we even have a Senate?"""
"LET'S GET THIS TO R/ALL!

Edit: FUCK YEAH!"
I'm British and just saw it in r/all. I cheered! Then sighed :(
"British person here, can confirm."
"I came from my frontpage and I confirm, it was really confusing."
[I've got my seat :)](http://i.imgur.com/JgKjoVZ.gif)
Holy crap no kidding. I'm in the UK now and it took me a second to figure out what this meant based on the sub.
"From r/all, am confused."
You cheeky bugger you. 
"Scottish guy here. Can confirm, was confused. More importantly, was let down."
"Haha I'm like ""they can fire him???"""
"Found it on page 5 of /all

you're getting close..."
Here from the second page from /r/all and yes really confusing.
Got me. I was completely surprised.
"I'm doing MY part, are you?! "
"It got there. Cunts. 

<3"
"...and it's on the front page of /all

/u/SomeKindOfMonster finally living up to his username."
"I don't usually participate in these things, but I'm so down for that."
I saw it and immediately looked at the sub.
[deleted]
Not British but was still excited then sheer and utter disappointment hit :(
"I actually thought ""How did they recall him? I haven't seen anything other than protests?"" until I saw the Sens."
As a fan of hockey and a follower of geopolitics this was doubly confusing.
It was. 
what is happening!?
Confused the shit out of me and I'm in this sub all the time. 
well here we are.
Oh man it really was. Was like woah for a second there. Good job folks :L 
"Oh believe me, it really was!"
...it did and it was
Can confirm. From /r/all. Never watched a hockey game in my life. Did double take.
"I'm a hockey fan and I was still confused. I'm Canadian too and I was thinking ""how'd he get fired? wtf?"""
I saw it on my front page and was absolutely confused.
I came to this post from r/all because I was confused. Then I saw what sub it was. As a Leafs fan I am now...elated? Meh. Really more like indifferent. 
"Was looking up Top of the Hour in All. Can confirm, am confused."
"Well mission accomplished, my mind was frazzled for a lil while"
How do you think I ended up here?
What determines if it makes it to /r/all?
It was really confusing. 
The damage is done.
Can confirm am on /r/All and assumed it had to do with the Panama Papers
It got to /r/all and I was confused.
Yes I'm from /r/all and my hopes got up :(
I was confused for a moment.
"Well, you got me."
"Can confirm, don't know shit about hockey, am very confused"
Can confirm. Was utterly confused when I saw I was in Hockey.
I got really excited and then saw the subreddit.
Genuinely made my heart skip a beat. I almost went for the remote to put on BBC 
"As both a /r/hockey regular, and an /r/all regular, can confirm, was confused."
You got me.
"It's a shame, I think he's done a really good job managing Fangraphs over the years."
It was. And I'm subscribed to /r/hockey haha
Can confirm. Was confused.
"It was, as a British person I was incredibly happy yet confused for a couple seconds "
It was confusing either way lol
I'm a casual hockey fan so I was very confused
"Doesn't matter, British Canadian who follows r/hockey and UK news - was terribly confused for a moment."
It has and it was.
My eyes lit up and then I cried.
I was browsing /r/nhl and I was still confused.
"It has, and it was"
It got to /all. I was really confused. 
Saw this on r/all. Very confused. 
I subscribe to subs where a headline like this would make sense in the other context. I'm high. I was really confused
Can confirm. Was very confused. 
Came here from r/all spot 1 can confirm was elated at heading and broke down crying when I saw it was hockey 
Op really is some kind of monster 
"It did, and it is. Had a moment of ""WTF??"""
"""YESSSS!!! Wait ... ""Dave""? ... *fired*?! ... *SENATORS*?!?! ... /r/hockey. Well shit."""
Thats exactly why im here. Damn you /r/hockey!
It did. was confused.
This is really confusing.
Yeah. That's why I'm here. Now I'm disappointed.
"Holy shit, I think we almost broke nhl.com, it's slow as shit.  "
Came from all was confused
I sub here and was still confused initially haha. 
"I barley follow hockey, but you guys have an amazing sub here. One of the best on reddit. Also Go kings Go! "
"Came here from r/all, and i love in the UK for a moment my thought was ""wait what""...  So mission accomplished "
I read this on /r/all. I was really confused.
"My first reaction was ""since when do we call him dave?"""
"I don't follow hockey, this fucking got me."
Subbed and still did a double take.
I already am.
"Yes, yes. The crumpet almost fell out of my mouth and I was confused as to how this got into /r/hockey. Big disappointment that it was not what I thought it was."
I'm gutted this is hockey
"It sure as hell confused me for a feq seconds

Was in /r/ all. Was confused.
"I was literally just reading an article on David Cameron defending his position on taxes, saw this title and was amazed how fast it happened."
"Tried to figure out why this was on my front page. I'm like, yeah, but why do so many people care? Then remembered about that British guy with the same name."
It got to /r/all and it's confusing
Yup.

Can confirm. From /r/all. Was confused.
That's arse for Cameron.
"i thought he fucked a pig, why you talkin about asses?"
Does everyone have bandwagon flair? I'm so confused
"Look, I love the /r/all people. They're great people, I've upvoted thousands on /r/all, I have a great relationship with the /r/all people. I'm going to do great with /r/all, in fact a poll came out on the front page recently, I polled 25% with /r/all; someone said if you get 25% of the /r/all upvotes, the front page is over... but if I'm upvoted, we are going to confuse the hell out of /r/all. We have to troll /r/all, or we won't have a hockey subreddit any more. We're going to troll /r/all, and it's going to be a great troll... and /r/all are going to pay for it."

"I thought the same thing, but then I thought, you can't just fire him, he either needs to resign and then the party needs to hold a leadership election, or the commons needs to have a vote of no confidence. "
I got quite excited for a second.
"I knew it wasn't worldnews, the lack of xenophobia gave it away"
Maybe there's a guy named Barack Obama who coaches in a minor Kenyan league who just got fired too
It's better it's r/hockey! 
So glad we can keep /r/all's political BS out of /r/hockey
"We have a process of setting these things here. So here's a stick helmet and some gloves poke one of us with the stick and say ""fight?"" If we respond by dropping our stick and our gloves, you may then proceed to drop your stick and gloves and fisticuffs will be engaged. Please not removing the helmet is poor form as is continuing to fight after the zebra tells you to stop. 

Hope that clears up the grievance process for you"
Yeah but I heard you'd still be fucked with even worse politicians if Cameron was to step down? I don't understand the joy but then again I don't really follow UK politics. 
Welcome to r/hockey! Pick a team and stay!

That's not too say Dorion isn't the right choice, though."

This makes me feel good about the Oilers revolving door of coaches since our last playoff run.

Its like you dont even believe in St Louis at all man. :("
They will have 3 head coaches on payroll next year.... 
And people called us coach killers
"No wonder they arnt a budget team, look at all these guys being paid to not be around the team. "
"HEY! Claude is not for sale! 
Yet... :("
Maybe this time our Owner will actually pay attention to the GM and hire an actual NHL calibre Head Coach. And not a bunch of assistant coaches. 
"Melnyk paying more to benefit the team? Why would he start now? The obvious cheap route is promoting Luke Richardson from Binghamton, so that's probably the direction he'll go."
"Considering how Melnyk the billionaire has the lowest payroll in the league or close to it, I would go with option #2."
Bring back Paulrus
Dorian said they are getting an experienced coach.
That's quite a big jump from 6 to 5040.
"Correction, our 1st line. He was playing with Turris during that cluster fuck of a stretch"
And his 1 goal was an empty netter lol
Remember that time he won a general election and got a majority in parliament? First conservative majority since 1992? haha 
I'm such a huge Hoffman fan. How can Cameron hate a sniper like him so much?
What about the time he porked a pig?
"What about when he stuck his cock in a dead pig, surely that is a more memorable moment."
One leads our team in goals...the other is second on our team in penalty minutes...totally transferable.

Ha, this might be my favorite edit ever. _/"
"They're both called Mike, maybe he got confused? "
I had him on my fantasy team and he was a shot blocking and hit god. Decent plus/minus rating from what I remember. 
"Meh. Every coach does this. It's a punishment to the real No1 liners and a reward for a plug like Borowiecki for a game or 2.

He didn't actually think Borowiecki was a better player for the first line.

It's all head games. Half of all coaching is head games designed to get the most out of people."
My favorite moment was when he fucked a dead pig.
"Well I mean, the coach is actually named Dave Cameron, and he was actually fired from his job (there were a ton of rumors)

It's just hilarious bit of timing where a first name could trick people while David Cameron is in the news for a bit of scandal. "
The backup backup goalie...
How the hell does that even matter or affect the rest of the season? I don't get how he thinks 1 game caused us to be bad?!
"And yet, he didn't get fired until now..."
Almost every single one of those guys had zero NHL head coaching experience until we hired them. No wonder they never last long. I want a guy with experience hired this time.

"Welcome to the Oilers fan base.

We've been terrible for a decade, but we just got what will probably be the best player for a decade last year, and have a good chance of getting another really good player this year.

Also everyone hates us because we keep getting good players but we keep on sucking.

Also you have to drink a lot because we keep losing.

"This is the biggest part of the firing imo. Hoffman was probably the most awkwardly utilized player on the team under Cameron but is clearly insanely talented. If you guys can get a coach that uses him *properly* (lol edit) and adds some more dimension to his game the sens would be scary as fuck. With him and Karlsson and still having Turris, Stone, and Zibby plus more young you guys coming up they'd be such a fun team to watch and probably a real playoff team. The pieces are there I'd say."

"*David Cameron is the UK PM. Still very close, lol"
"honestly his management of the lines and our players is a much bigger issue. 

That and trying to drive hoffman out of town. "
That was honestly the least of Cameron's problems. Certainly didn't help though. 
"Such experience, very Julien"
I believe the Parliament have to approve of it first.

That's exactly right. I came here expecting the PM of UK to have resigned...

Julien hasn't been fired and hopefully won't. He had nearly an AHL caliber defense and still nearly got us to the playoffs
nah he's from PEI.
NBC can keep him...or Boston!

Only Detroit is the same. Most teams seem to spend around 2 million a year on a coach.

So saying he doesn't spend any money is obviously not true, he's spending over 60 million dollars a year. Saying he's cheap relative to a lot of other teams? Very true. "

"David Cameron is the Prime Minister of the UK and is in a bit of trouble as of recent because it came to light that his family has been dodging tax through the whole Panama thing, plus he's increasingly unpopular as a PM because of his seemingly unpopular campaign for the UK to remain a member of the European Union, and many think he's going to step down soonish anyway. It's big news for the UK.

Dave Cameron is the head coach of the Ottawa Senators National Hockey League team, he's just been fired because the Senators underperformed this season.

I'm not saying the replacement would be better, but it would force them back to the drawing board, put a renewed focus on making the elite pay their fair share, and be pretty hilarious to watch."

He's just not the right one, right now. This team needs some hard decisions and transitions.

A coach long praised for defensive tendencies and strength that was unable to play a strong defense. I'd think someone of his esteem would be able to get some skill out of the pieces he has available. Big steps backwards from Krug, Killer. Age is a factor with Seidenberg and Chara but he was largely unable to manage their time. No impressive steps forward for Ciller and trotman. Nobody wowed me.

"2nd worst possession player on our team, can't pass, can't shoot, usually stuck in the defensive zone. He played around 5-6 games at forward I think, and he didn't get one shot on goal. Also went ~20 games within a shot on goal at some other point in the year as well. Plus-minus doesn't mean much when evaluating a player, Cowen was our best +/- this year until he got traded. I guess it's good for fantasy hockey though.."
Mark Borowiecki is a defenseman. He chose to take a 6/7 defenseman and put him on the first forward line instead of just shifting someone up and putting in one of our depth forwards. It was ridiculous. That is *not* something every coach does.....

Watched all the games and completely fell in love with hockey, and felt drawn to the Sens

Supported them ever since, bought my first Jersey last October, probably going to buy another one for next season, can't decide what player yet but it's almost definitely going to be one of our alt jerseys :)

Shhhh why are you explaining it.
"I'd assume you're from outside the UK given the sub and your post. Cameron didn't personally do anything wrong, he was implicated but has been cleared, and the pressure for him to step down is basically non existent apart from the people who were saying he should anyway.

Remaining in Europe is one of the few things I see eye to eye with him on.

It's her right as the sovereign, technically British democracy for the Head of State is merely allowed by the monarchy, who could retake control whenever they wanted. She could also dissolve Parliament, but many of the last monarchs who tried that ended up with their heads removed. If anybody complains, she has the power to take personal control of the British military, and that would be that.

I'm sure Queenie can if she didn't want whatever power she has left taken away. :P
"Well technically the Queen. That's assuming the UK doesn't have a  Governor General, which is still technically the Queen.

There is some interesting debate about that. Arguably the Queen has that power. Based on how it has been done in Canada in Australia it is pretty clear his Cabinet could force his resignation.

The Queen can fire him but it would cause a constitutional shit-storm and probably end the monarchy.
Could we just dissolve David Cameron? Like... in acid?  That would solve a lot of the problems.

It's great to hear you've all gone and fired your PM."

"That's not how the British system works, we don't elect a head of state, we elect a ruling party. Tony Blair didn't even finish his last term for example, Gordon Brown took over. The point being David Cameron was not democratically elected, the Conservative Party was elected. "

If you're surrounded by students and left-wingers like I am you begin to forget people actually still like David. He's definitely not staying on until 2020, he's most likely to step down after the EU referendum or in the next couple of years at least. "

Edit: I get i now I misread yourfirst comment"
"Since I'm not longer at work I just want to flush out my opinion more:
 
Also this is not one bad seasons. This is 2 in a row where they had zero fight at the end of the year. This is a coach who's been out in the first round many times, and even after the presidents trophy. He's a coach that has taken great teams to the top. Gotten into the crapshoot that is the finals, with premier talent (especially for his heavy style). But when he has less talent overall, or it's a square peg in a round hole between his players and system, he struggles to put the team together. 
 
This is a coach with a great attitude for a solid 4 line team with 6 DMen. His ""we're going to roll 4 lines, day in day out"" mentality works great when you have predictable contributors. It's great when you win more than you lose. It's great to go into a game with your 25 knowing you have enough to beat the other 25. He's very consistent. 
 
But that bleeds into complacency when you have inconsistency. The constant press conferences where you can predict ""scheduled losses"" against heavy teams. ""We're just going to go in there and do what we always do"" doesn't work when you go into LA, or Chicago and get blown off the floor. You can't roll 4 down 4. It doesn't work in the winter classic, when the other team is jacked up playing in your house in front of 65000 and feeling it. That's not another day at the office. I get the need to not get overexcited, but you need to rise to the occasion and your opponents emotion. 
 
The mood in the room is dictated by the coach. Aside from the system it's arguably his biggest impact on the team. Sure, line matching and game day lines have impact on the ice, but in a marathon like the NHL, having a solid room is the Coach's job. 
 
Feel free to disagree. But I feel like the time has come. This isn't a ""we're firing you because you can't coach anymore/don't fit the league/didn't do well"" conversation. This is a we're moving in a new direction and want you to have the best opportunity for continued success. We don't yet know what we have in the way of upcoming talent, and we don't think it meshes with your philosophy. We don't want to embroil you with our transition. The championship window is closed, barring a miracle, for the guys who do best in your system (Chara, Seidenberg, Kelly). It's time for us to move on from you as an organization. "
"In my opinion this is the same as firing both Francona and Doc Rivers, to borrow from MLB and NBA. While they were both great coaches that won championships, it's just been a bit too long here. It's time to move into the next era of Bruins Hockey. 
 
Obviously the Celtics picked the right guy in Stevens while the Sox picked the wrong guy twice. "
That really was the stretch where pretty much our whole fanbase realized he was a complete moron. And it was the span of like 2 weeks..
What's with Ottawa coaches and making weird lineup decisions? I remember Paul Maclean getting criticized for playing his 3rd and 4th lines too much.
"I believe he also did it at the expense of keeping Shane Prince in the press box, another questionable decision."
"I don't care if it sends a message, it was an idiotic thing to do. You can send a message some other way. Putting a 6/7th defender on your 1ST LINE is insane, and it puts winning the actual games in jeopardy. "
It's karma making up for O'Connor's fuckup in last year's NCAA championship game.

"it was a rule, and is no longer a rule. They took it out for Jan 2016. IT didnt last long. The logistics were stupid. A fired coach might not get a job because they would also have to lose a draft pick. This caused some fired coaches to obviously lose out on jobs because teams just didnt want to compensate another team for a fired personel. The rule was brought in so Toronto couldn't just offer 10 million to dave tippett to leave the Coyotes and join the leafs super bench and the coyotes get nothing. Instead they included a stupid stipulation that included fired personnel.

Now I'm not 100 percent but i think they just removed the fired personnel clause. So the rule still prevents ""poaching"" but fired coaches no longer have a competitive disadvantage when interviewing for new jobs.

This also applies to management."

"Two Jack Adams nominations in a row, coached an unlikely team to the playoffs. He got fired way too early IMO, two thirds of the way through a season after winning the Jack Adams? Come on "

"Budget is certainly a factor, but coaching **is** a huge problem.

Fact is they keep firing *rookie* coaches. They keep hiring new coaches that have never coached in the NHL before and surprise, surprise there's problems and the club tries again...with another rookie.

When you have a terrible PP and PK and *nothing changes* to fix it, you have a coaching problem, not a player problem. When mediocre players with ""grit"" are being favoured over helping struggling skilled players, you have a coaching problem.

And the budget problem is even part of the coaching problem—because we historically haven't been willing to spend money on a good coach.

Quick rundown: In the Constitutional Monarchy system, the Head of State is always the King/Queen. They choose a representative called the Governor General to act as Head of State because they can't be in two places at once.  (contrast with Americans electing their President as both Head of State and Head of Government) The Canadian Head of Government is called the Prime Minister, and is usually the leader of the party who wins a plurality of seats in Parliament.  They themselves are normally elected to Parliament in a district which traditionally votes their way. After the voting is over, the party leader goes to the GG and asks for permission to form a government using the election's results as proof that the leader has the **confidence** of Parliament to rule. There's a couple of implications here:

* A government can be ""defeated"" in Parliament if they lose a major vote (e.g. budget, major bill) or otherwise lose the confidence of Parliament. Once that happens, Parliament holds a non-confidence vote. If the ruling party loses, Parliament is dissolved and an election is called.

* The ruling party's leader might actually lose the election in his/her riding. They cannot participate in Question Period and instead must watch from the visitor's gallery. This quickly will lead to a non-confidence vote. If that happens, there's an unspoken rule that an MP in another ""guaranteed"" riding will resign their seat and a byelection is called, with the party leader in the running. "

"Again, I'm not sure how familiar you are with the British system but we don't elect heads of state. We're a Constitutional Monarchy, not a republic. The Queen is our head of state. The Prime Minister is the head of the British government, and the British government works on behalf of the Queen. This goes to the heart of how British people vote, because we are not voting for a representative of the UK, we already have one. 

In the British system the voters vote for political parties. To illustrate this, David Cameron said last year that if the Conservatives win the next election he will not serve as Prime Minister. Notice how he talks about the party winning, not him. It wouldn't make sense for him to say that if the system works like you believe. He is very explicitly stating that people vote for parties. 

I didn't downvote you by the way, I'm assuming you're not British which is why you didn't understand how our system works. Here's a quote from Wikipedia that explains the Prime Minister position:

>The office is not established by any constitution or law but exists only by long-established convention, which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the Prime Minister is the Monarch's puppet. The Prime Minister is the effective leader of the country. But you're wrong in framing him/her as a democratically elected head of state. That's not how the system works and it's just not how the British public perceives it."
"Hockey fans are the nicest fans mate! Hopefully you stick around the sub for a couple days, becuase the playoffs start tomorrow!!!"
"You should totally get into the sport. We love to help people get into the game. There are even teams in the UK that you can root for if you so please.

Either way, now is the right time to get into Hockey. We're just about to our playoffs. In the NHL, at the end of the regular season, sixteen of the top teams compete against each other in a quasi-World Cup format. Two teams are pitted against eachother to see which can win four games between eachother first. The loser gets eliminated and the winning team goes up against another until there are two teams left. This is known as The Stanley Cup Finals. As before, a team has to win four games against the other team, and if they do, they get a massive trophy called The Stanley Cup, which has the names of players and teams who had previously won engraved on it. This trophy has been competed for even before the 1900s, even before when the NHL was first formed.

Playoff games are the best because teams play with an even greater intensity, and they get very bloody sometimes. The first rounds are great because teams usually play against their rivals. Imagine a seven game series between EPL teams like Man U and Man City. That's what's about to go down right now in multiple playoff series.

Our subreddit also has a handy wiki if you want to learn more about the sport. Feel free to check it out!"
"I had an ex from around Nashville when I was starting to get into hockey. I roll with a Sheffield Steelers flair when the EIHL season is running and a Predators one when the playoffs roll round and the EIHL season ends. 

There's constant talk of it, and BoJo has definitely shown he's trying to force some sort of drift between himself an Cameron, there's definitely some sort of truth to the rumours in one way or another. The Brexit thing with the media is exactly what I'm talking about. There's a plethora of low-rate media in the out camp, but comparatively less popular or blatant supporters for the in camp. It's really too hard to tell at the moment what will happen, and I doubt there will be enough time to come to even a good prediction as to what will happen. "
You can't just say all right wing players are Eurosceptics. 
"It's actually fairly evenly split. A gross simplification is this:

Some right-wingers don't like being told what to do by foreigners and hate immigrants.""Our country, our laws borders"" they cry. They may also think socialist doctrine is being imposed from Europe.(Outies)

Some right-wingers like being able to form close trade and security relationships with other countries (The economy stupid.) (Innies)

Some people are still weighing it up (the undecideds/don't knows)

Some left-wingers like the trade benefits as well as the protection for workers on a variety of 
issues of the EU. (innies)

Some left-wingers don't like immigrations (jobs for the British) and also think that the EU reduces job opportunities. They may and/or think that capitalist doctine is being imposed from Europe. (Outies)"

We shall have to see what happens though. As for the campaign, that's true enough, but with the amount of businesses backing the in campaign you have to think they'll end up with more money, so more adverts and more influence maybe. It really is far too hard to tell though, it could swing either way. Just out of interest, what way are you planning on voting?

"People in the 1920s were strange.  Stranger than today.

And yes, though the modern role of the Governor General is pretty much only ceremonial, and based on historical tradition.  The GG is the representative of the Crown (Elizabeth II being Queen of Canada, and whom is technically the Head of State).  So when the PM wishes to call an election, they request that the GG dissolve Parliament.

As the King-Byng affair demonstrated, having the King/Queen's representative overrule the wishes of the PM in Ottawa does not go over well.  If it were to ever happen again, it would probably put Canada on the fast track toward republicanism.  And that, incidentally, is among the reasons why the Governor General acceded to Stephen Harper's wish to prorogue (suspend but not dissolve) Parliament in 2008 during a [little spat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute) the government and the opposition were having."
"We wouldn't vote for them, but they'd elect themselves anyway"
It's in a book?
"There's a subreddit, /r/NHLStreams, that you can check out. 
They'll post stream links in threads on game days. "
"I'll echo that /r/NHLStreams is a great resource. And because it can be a bit overwhelming deciding who to watch, some of the more interesting series this season, in my opinion would be: 

* St. Louis vs Chicago - one of the surprisingly few traditional rivalry matchups in the first round this season. These two teams don't particularly like each other all that much. Not to mention Chicago won the Stanley Cup last season and have won it three times in the last six seasons.
* Washington vs Philadelphia - Washington had one of the more dominant seasons in recent history. They have one of the most dynamic players in the NHL in Alexander Ovechkin who became only the third player in NHL history to score 50 goals in a season seven times. Their goalie Braden Holtby also tied an NHL record for wins in a season. This is definitely the team to watch this year.
* Dallas vs Minnesota - In 1993 the Minnesota North Stars moved their franchise to Dallas. Despite being a hockey-loving region, there was no NHL hockey in Minnesota until 2000 when the Minnesota Wild were founded. To be honest, I don't know what kind of animosity there is between the teams or the fan-bases, but it is a bit of an interesting storyline. 

Some other interesting story-lines from the other series': LA vs San Jose for a California match-up with LA having won two Cups in the last four years; 44 year-old Jaromir Jagr still playing some excellent hockey for the Florida Panthers in their match-up against the New York Islanders; Detroit Red Wings legend Steve Yzerman is running the show as the General Manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning as they face-off in their second playoff match-up in two years (although Detroit isn't playing well lately and Tampa has some major injuries they're dealing with); Anaheim and Nashville are playing against each other... I can't come up with an interesting angle in this match-up, but then I'm not amazingly familiar with either team; and finally Pittsburgh and New York Rangers are playing each other for the third year in a row with the Rangers winning both previous match-ups, Pittsburgh is going to be looking for some revenge."
"And here's some information on [Lord Stanley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Stanley,_16th_Earl_of_Derby), sixth Governor General of Canada (under Queen Victoria), and 16th Earl of Derby. He presented the Stanley Cup to Canada, which is currently awarded to the top NHL team annually."
Probably because hockey is considered a niche sport in most places. We get excited when people from around the world show interest. Especially since a lot of us think it's the best sport there is :)
"We do get good attendances in some cities. It's definitely consolidating its hold with crowds. It's just a little early for so much analysis on the subject to write it off as four years away in my opinion.

I can certainly agree with you on that, whenever someone comes out as supportive of the out campaign it's seen as some great victory to validate the fears of the EU. And I don't think I'm 100% decided yet, but I would more than likely vote to stay in if the vote was tomorrow, purely because the EU seems to have done a lot to benefit my life personally such as funding my college back in Rotherham and my university in Manchester.

"
"Feel free to prove it, if you can actually show that there is a high likelihood that Cameron will soon be stepping down from his position then fine. I'm dismissing him because he has no evidence and his current position makes him likely to a specific bias. "
"He's not dismissing him. He's echoing the other's thoughts on being stuck surrounded by biased, out of context thinkers"
"To actually clarify, private firearm sales in the United States are fully legal, barring exceptions in some states. The mods in the gun sales subs are super anal about legality as well, the last thing they want is for their sub to get shut down, also considering how short their leash is."

"Ah yes. I had a similar coach, he always played his kid the whole game and he was our worse mid. :/ he only played 1 or 2 years too, no idea where he came from or where he went after that"
"Yeah ok, you picked one example of an overrated player that was replaced once semi-successfully. 

The example isn't really very good though, because Therrien is a horrible coach who couldn't bring a loaded Pens team to a cup and now has massively underachieved for multiple seasons with Montreal, culminating in this disaster of a season, showing his team couldn't hold it together and be even mediocre without all-world goaltending..."

"Right, and he only said that he thinks the PM will stand down. The same amount of evidence you provided, except he did it without condescending.

Echo chamber, radical, teenager, lack of diverse opinions, ""reality"", pipe dream. All different ways of outright dismissing him without actually saying why he's wrong. 

You tell me how your surroundings are more ""real"" or legitimate than his."
"He decried the others position solely because he's in university. Look at the language he used. Echo chamber, radical teenagers, pipe dreams, etc. All the while providing no evidence to the contrary.

Even if he was echoing his thoughts, he went about it in a toolish way.

It's like your coworker fucks something up and says, ""God, I'm dumb."" And then you hit em back with a, ""Yeah, you're an idiot. Downright retarded. Why'd you even try that while knowing you're so stupid?""

Reminds me of the old NFL Quarterbacks Facebook meme every week. 
"That last comment, jeez"
I keep saying every sport would be better on ice. 
"Fuck football, fuck hockey, I wanna play Hockball!"
play ball!
Well that definitely won't improve ratings :/
Way better idea than when they recommend covering the field in spiders 
ball. lmao
"Not going to lie, I would watch the fuck out of that game"
You boys are a sensitive bunch. They made a joke not even at hockey's expense? *time to trash the whole sport!*

"Brockian Ultra Cricket
Rule One: Grow at least three extra legs. You won't need them, but it keeps the crowds amused.
Rule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player and clone him off a few times. This saves an enormous amount of tedious selection and training.
Rule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large field and build a high wall round them.
The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what's going on leads them to imagine that it's a lot more exciting than it actually is. A crowd that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life-affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history.
Rule Four: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the walls for the players. Anything will do — cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis guns, skis, anything you can get a good swing with.
Rule Five: The players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand. Whenever a player scores a 'hit' on another player, he should immediately run away and apologize from a safe distance.
Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and points, delivered through a megaphone.
Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins.
It is said that the rules of Brockian Ultra-Cricket are so controversial that the civilizations which play it spend more time in a state of war over their interpretation than they do actually playing the game; it is mentioned that the rules are so lengthy and complex that the one time they were collected in one place for reference, a black hole was formed out of their mass. It is believed that ""in the long run, a good solid war is less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket"", so this may be a good thing."

"I think it mostly boils down to people don't watch it because no one else watches it. Most people get into sports because of friends or family, so if nobody you know watches hockey, then you won't. Plus it's typically a lot harder to find on TV than other sports. Plus a lot of people think fighting sets a bad example for kids. Plus it's also a sport for rich white people."
[deleted]
People generally like watching the sports they played growing up.  With all the warm weather areas and the extra expense of hockey not as many people play it in their younger years.
because its expensive and needs cold weather.  Yes you can play indoors. But 99% of Canadians did some of their first skating on a outdoor rink. Also it is not on national tv all that much. Also alot of the teams are fairly new. They are only a few teams with more then 20+ years in the same city (with moderate success). So their fandom has yet to be passed from generation to generation.  I also think that NCAA hockey only being relevant in about a dozen schools also has a huge impact.  Imagine if the same amount of NCAA schools offered a hockey program similar to its basketball and football programs.  Where kids were heavily recruited as early as junior high.  
"Coming from someone who isn't a fan of hockey hasnt really watched much of it, one of the reasons why basketball's speed is great is because you score like all the time. Its one of the reasons why I cant get into soccer. Can't say its a reason I dont watch hockey to be honest, I've just never really looked much into the sport"
"I've also heard it said that Americans like their sports to be situational. Take Baseball for example: ""Bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, 3-2 count.  Here's the pitch!""  Football: ""It's 4th and goal, Ball at the 1 yard line. Play clock down to 2. This is for the game!""

Hockey tends to be a little more complicated and when goals are scored, everyone is surprised and elated, but they're more unpredictable than the scoring in most popular American Sports."

We'd do this on the frozen lake sometimes. We didn't tackle and all but it was fun as hell to just fly down the ice trying to catch the ball. 
There usually is. It's glorious.
Again
Depression?
why would it in football if it doesn't in hockey?
"You are right though, it's part of the game in the NHL and when someone is able to fold the guy they are fighting and get him on the ice they usually stop, or a couple refs brake it up. In the NFL guys wouldn't stop, and refs wouldn't be able to break up a fight between two 300 pound linemen. Even if they somehow broke one fight up, there are 20 other people on the field they should be policing also which wouldn't work, it would be chaos. 

Having said all that, it would be cool as fuck if NFL players were allowed to square up, just institute some very serious rules and it would work. Like if you jump someone with other players that's a 3 game suspension which is huge for football."

Right. The +/-. I don't see how playing in a different type of rink with a leather puck will change anybody's +/-.
"In Finnish, football (""soccer"" for you, I guess) is called ""jalkapallo"" which is foot+ball. With bad players (such as our national team), it is often called ""potkupallo"" which is kick+ball."
It's called football because the ball is a foot long
Don't know why you got down voted. Same reason why people in America don't seem to be that into soccer either. 
Watch the Jets! Their games are entertaining as shit!
Should have been a comment about letting the Safety drop back into Deep Cover 1 in front of the tiny netted end-zone.
"There is about 5 or 6 teams that are fun to watch, but only if they play each other. "
"> people don't watch it because no one else watches it.

People always seem to underrate this factor, maybe because it doesn't present an obvious solution. When people wonder why a sport isn't popular, they usually list some attributes of the sport that they like, as seen above. However, I don't ever remember sitting down with a table of sports and their attributes, and then selecting which ones I want to follow the most (whether we're talking about sports I knew of as a little kid or sports I only recently got into). That's just not how people get into a sport. Otherwise, you'd see a much more thorough mixture of sports being watched around the world, rather than people starting with the sports already popular around them."
I only started watching hockey because my friend invited me over to get drunk and watch the playoffs in 2012. You can see how that went.
Oh come now.  Most of us are football fans without ever actually playing it competitively. 
"More poutine, hockey and maple syrup is always a good decision. "
"Plus the expense of playing removes a large portion of the market. There's a reason the NHL fans are richer and it isn't due to the sport being more appealing (although it is), but at least partially due to not having people exposed to it as kids playing it."
"Well now is your chance! Time to pick a team, flair up, and yell at people because they like the ducks."
"That's actually why basketball is the only of the four major sports i don't follow: i can't stand how much scoring there is. If everyone scores 100 points a game, the game is only interesting at the end, and that's only if it's close. I know a lot about basketball, and have followed it mostly through osmosis since i was a kid, but it just isn't my thing, and i don't think it ever will be. "
But for that very reason basketball doesn't interest me. I don't find something fun to watch when everyones scoring all the time. Scoring holds more weight and each goal means more in ice hockey and footba-uhh soccer 
">  one of the reasons why basketball's speed is great is because you score like all the time

Which is the big reason why basketball is pointless to watch until the last 5 minutes.

With hockey and soccer, important scoring can happen at *any* time."
That's a good point!
You'll learn to track the puck by the ways in which the players are moving and reacting if you watch enough hockey. Definitely can be a bit of a barrier to enjoying the sport though if you aren't familiar with it. 
A common tip is to watch where the players are going. They know where the puck is and by watching them you'll get used to tracking it. 
"After about twenty years of watching, you don't even watch the guy with the puck anymore. You watch the open man setting up."
"Go to a game and you'll figure it out pretty quick. The problem with television is that you can't see things developing, whereas at a live game you can see (and hear!) the entire sheet of ice.

I had the privilege of using a suite a center ice for a few years, but I still prefer sitting about 15 rows up in the corner -- it's where I ""feel"" the game the most... hard to explain, but I'm sure everyone has their own favorite spots to watch from..."

"There's an unwritten code in hockey that allows fighting to take place without getting too out of hand. It's hard to understand if you haven't played the game.

I'm definitely making an assumption here - there might be a certain level of respect amongst players that makes it similar to hockey, but I'd be skeptical. Plus, NFL players are enormous humans and there are a lot more of them on the field - it'd be hard to control an entire NFL team once things got out of hand."
You're asking the right question.
Because they're bigger and they're not on ice? Being on ice dampens the blows significantly. 
"Being on ice as opposed to grass you have a lot less traction and while still being able to punch hard, you won't be able to punch as hard. Also, NFL players are typically bigger than NHL players."
"Honestly, while I have never played hockey, I bet it has to do with the mindset you have to be in when you play football. Some people, including myself, just have to get mad as fuck to play well out on the football field. I have played other sports, and usually I was very cerebral and calm while palying. However, for football I just needed to have some rage in me to play football well. I don't know if that translates to hockey as well."
"Aussie Rules requires you to either kick or what's known as handball (kinda like an underhand serve in volleyball) in order to give the ball to a teammate through the air.  Also, scoring is only done via kick; so,  it definitely qualifies as ""football"" -- moreso than North American codes. "

"The thing with soccer is that if you're not appreciating build up and tactics, you'll find the game slow and boring. It's like when you start watching hockey and you don't understand puck movement well, or why they aren't just bombing shots during a power play instead of cycling the puck.



Movement in space, holding shape, creating 3 v 2 and 4 v 3 advantages in midfield to advance the ball are all things that get lost on a casual fan. 



[This bit of play by Barcelona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPxF9o5Op5M) is a clinic in beautiful spacing and team play to control the ball. Watch how they create mismatches across the field, holding a diamond shape with 4 players where only 2 defenders can try to pressure a pass, and they just keep the ball moving until they get a chance on goal. They complete 30 passes before they generate an attempt, and even though they don't score it's gorgeous to watch how they basically just toy with the other team. 



Soccer is 90 minutes of continuous teamwork and tactical movement, and casual fans just don't see the little things like great runs and holding perfect shape to appreciate it. If you don't know what you're watching, it comes off as boring. "

Our season summed up in one beautiful picture
"Penguin player in front of the net and closest Devils player is 5 feet away?

Checks out.  "
"Dang, that's sidebar material right there. Every time I open the image I insta-flinch, would be good for VR."
"penalty

This reminds me of the [NHL 95 cover/load screen](https://www.destructoid.com/elephant/ul/49774-noscale-NHL-95-title-screen.jpg).
"This looks like an ad, what a great shot"
"What is this? Like 12k? Seriously, this looks clearer than real life. "
"This is the worst sub in the history of subs, maybe ever. There is never any joy to be found here, only sadness and pain."

Here's a dumb question: How is this photo taken? I'm assuming its from the net cam? Is there some guy upstairs getting a live feed of the camera and just remotely taking photos from it? 
Cory Schneider has looked like that all season. That part is very credible.   
Wow! This would be a great ad for the Devils... if it wasn't a goal against.
" *Record scratch * 

*Yea that's me Coreigh, and as you can see the 2016-17 season wasn't going so well for me and the boys. How did I get here? Well it all started during the 2013 NHL Entry Draft...*"
I wish the devils weren't eliminated from the playoffs yet. This is the perfect picture to Subban-ify...
"this is the most quintessential *""this is hockey""* photo i have ever laid my eyes on."
Hello r/all
"Here's the goal.

"Ooh new wallpaper material

There should be a subreddit for hockey pics"
"""Oh my GOD!""

-Devils player #7"
Hornqvist goal scored.  He's standing on top of the goalie. Looks legit. 
Subscribe? Unsubscribe? I'm torn. 
Looks like next years cover of NHL18
Holy shit that is awesome
"This picture is incredibly high def.  Zoom in on each player's face, it's incredible.

Horqvist looks so smugly satisfied with himself.  Moore's 'oh shit!' face is absolutely hilarious (that's him on the left, yeah?)."
Looks like the penalty kill didn't go so well
Wow WTF. This is amazing. Next sidebar pic ? it's sooo my new wallpaper
"Possessed puck murders hockey players  
  
PENALTY KILL  
  
In theatres this Halloween "
"""Puck is out of focus. This whole photo is garbage."" -me if I had taken the picture "
Looks like the cover of a straight to DVD movie. Well call it Penalties Kill. 
guessing the penalty kill was unsuccessful
Ugh when am I gonna get into hockey 
"Yeah, that's pretty fucking awesome."
"This is amazing.  I love how everyone is looking right at the puck/camera, even both linesmen. "
People who don't even like hockey still need to see this photo. 
This needs to be the NHL 2018 cover.
I feel so bad for Cory Schneider.
"This looks like an intro to a hockey movie, like it's going through the play and it freezes right there and the movie starts "
"Where was this tech in 2004? 
Asking for myself. Still pissed

[Mock NHL 17 Cover](https://imgur.com/gallery/EDkUy)
"As much as the season has sucked and we even lost this game, I'd love this photo in hi res. "
A pic like this should be the next cover of EA's NHL. Done with game graphs of course
Sums up my fantasy hockey season after I drafted Schneider in the 2nd round.
Did not expect that 
Sure...
I love that you can see both linesman perfectly framed in their entirety as well. And they're actually watching the play!
The goalie with crippling anxiety is on the team with fuck-all defense. It's a match made in heaven.
"John Moore lives around the corner from me in Hoboken, NJ. My dog and his dog sniffed each other while we were both taking our pups for a walk the other morning. I also dined next to him at a local cuban restaurant. 

I sound creepy now but whatever man."
"This hurts my eyes full screen, because they're trying to bring the puck into a sharp focus."
This would make for a great wallpaper on my computer. A beautiful and constant reminder of our pain.
/r/AccidentalRenaissance 
Looks like the DVD cover to Goon. 
Was this the 6th or 7th goal that Schneider let in? They've all started to meld together. 
Didn't know they played in an intergalactic battle arena 
"Now I know what Doctor Manhattan was talking about when he said: *""I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast, that they can hardly be said to have occurred at all.""*"
"Maybe it's a dumb question, but what does ""penalty kill"" mean?"
"-sigh- 



Ok, yea, it is a pretty great pic. "
That puck took an incredible selfie!
The bot photographers are stepping up their game.
Immediately wallpapered.

Accidental hockey renaissance.
Sidebar?
...did the camera survive?
.... I've seen better! /s
"wow.... ""Keep your eye on the puck""

Every single one of 'em paid attention to that mantra."
This must be used in the nhl 18 cover 
This would be a great promo poster for NJ if it wasn't a goal against them.
Looks like an old school video game cover.
I hope the cameraman wasn't hurt ;)
This needs to be the new NHL video game cover
I vote this for the next EA Sports NHL cover

I love images with layers...foreground, middle ground, background...all having something of value.

I got a similar shot of Ovechkin during a warm up some time back (not nearly as cool though):

We stink but at least our logo is awesome.
This reminds me of the NHL 95 cover I'm sure someone already said this but I'm unoriginal and too lazy to check.

Awesome pic.  Sucks that a pens player is in it tho. ;)
Why were they all just standing there looking at the puck? Do something!
"Wow, that's a fantastic shot."
Is that Matt Damon as a goalie?
"Awesome picture for New Jersey to use..... of them being scored on.
"
"gawd damint why the Pens are in this picture, it'd have been in my desktop background pic otherwise."
someone should post this to /r/photoshopbattles 
Even two of the referees are framed perfectly between limbs and looking towards the puck.  Great shot. 
Looks like a Video Game cover.
Definitely not a promo picture for NJ
How's that PK going?
I don’t like either of those teams but that’s a good shot
"All the lights make it look like its snowing, just amazing!"
amazing!
This looks like it should be a title screen for one of EA Sports' NHL games 
Imagine a picture like this is taken of the Stanley Cup winning goal in game 7 OT 
"wish it wasn't IN the net...but good pic, otherwise"
Does Big Ben play hockey in the off-season? 
"I should start watching hockey. 

I know it has a reputation for being a somewhat violent sport but I had no idea they had a penalty kill. Damn."
"Hard to look at this. Hate these teams, but a good photo."
"Both Refs are in the picture too, that's kinda neat."
NHL 14. It's in the game
*record scratch*
"Ahh the goalie look of ""god damn it really?""

I know it well."
"Hornquist......I don't fucking like that piece of shit hahaha, solid year tho, penguins look ready for playoffs "
"It almost looks fake
"
Even the logo is facing up
That is a sexy picture.
One guy scoring and four guys shocked that he scored.
It would be an amazing ad poster for the devils... if it wasn't going into there own net. 
Wow that's pretty amazing
"Sucks to see my boy Cory Schneider wasted on a bad team. No offense, NJ...the Canucks suck just as much but we liked that kid a lot in Vancouver. He's elite and his prime will be spent outside the playoff picture."

Merrill on the ice for a goal against? I can tell this isn't shopped.

Is there a subreddit dedicated to pictures like this? There was one a couple seasons ago from a [red wings game](http://buzzlamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sports-0212-32.jpg) and I've been craving one from a caps game
[Even better picture right after the goal](http://imgur.com/gallery/b5Cl8)
Can I have that puck?
"That is not an incredible picture. It's terrible, one of the worst I've ever seen.

Off to /r/eyebleach I go"
r/accidentalrenaissance 
In the NJ net? Sorry but this was a pretty common occurrence... 
"No.  This is not incredible.  Not at all.

Ok, the pic is pretty cool objectively."
who's the girl in the middle left?
For a split second there I wondered when [David Davidson](http://www.metal-archives.com/images/3/4/9/3/3493_artist.jpg?4408) had switched careers from playing in a metal band to playing for the Penguins.
It's alright
[deleted]
When was this taken? Had to be a few years back at least with Brodeur in net.
Can we please have a more accurate depiction here? Someone photoshop Crosby hacking someone.... anyone... doesn't even have to be a Devils player.
/r/AccidentalRenaissance

RIP lens
"Incredible the logo just happened to be perfectly place on the puck, right side up and facing the camera. Yeah. Doubt there's any Photoshop here. Good pic otherwise"
The penalty kill on the scoreboard makes it even better. 
Taylor Hall died for this? 
"""KILL"" "
So true 
"We know its a rebuilding year, no need to rub it in guys :/"
Yup. I didn't even go to one game this season.
That could have easily been avoided with a glove catch.
Hornqvist lives in front of the net. 
Quit losing we need that draft pick
It's too bad for this photographer that this puck is going INTO the NJ net. The team would have used the crap out of that photograph if was a good memory for NJ. 
The problem seems to be that he wasn't checked out.
Well the goalie is still there!
This is standard practice for us…
"Well, to be fair, it's an ultra wide angle lens so everything looks much further way than it actually is. 

Wide lenses expand distance, telephoto lenses compress."
"Empty look of unsurprised despair on Cory's face?

Check."
Too busy trapping at the blue line just in case

Oh my god. Nostalgia just hit me like a truck.

"They actually had Ben Lovejoy sitting inside the net with a camera. Our coaches thought he would be more effective on the kill there instead of in the open ice, seeing as he can't clear pucks anyway."
"Yup, net cam. The photographer has a trigger and just presses it whenever there's action around the goal. If my understanding is correct, it's done blind, so whether the shots are good or not can't be determined until afterwards."
"Here's a short video of the camera mount being installed in a net.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICSinv-HyhY"
"I laughed, then I cried"
Well atleast this way it wouldn't be false advertisement.
"To be honest, I don't know how much fun he'd be having on Vancouver this year, either."
It should be about the pucks life. It's closest to the camera.

"Six guys thought life was just a game until one of them got out of line and locked up.  Now they're finding things aren't as easy with a missing piece.  All they need to is last two minutes in New Jersey and everything should be okay.  Already behind in the score and a man down, thes
