# compare-toxicity

ECE 180 Project by Group 1.

## Puropose
In the real world, people treat others with politeness and hospitality, but in the virtual world people tend to speak without considering the courtesy and morality of the situation. We want to analyze how conflicting people’s overall reactions would be to a certain topic when their anonymity is taken away. The importance of this project is to understand how anonymity affects people’s behavior on the internet.
